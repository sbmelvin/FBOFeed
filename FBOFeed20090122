<DESC>Randolph AFB intends to issue a purchase order, sole source, to Laguna Construction Company for the repair/replacement of the High Level Liquid Alarm System in the JP8 Fuel Storage Tanks number 20 and 21.  The requirement is intended to bring the existing unfriendly environmental condition into compliance with CFR Title 40, ‘Protection of Environment.’  The project site is the JP8 Fuel Storage Yard, 4th St. West, Bldg 1039, Randolph AFB, Texas.  The wiring system on the High Level Liquid Alarm Systems shorted due to the entry of rain water in the junction boxes.  Additionally, the conduits have deteriorated and need to be replaced.  Laguna Construction Company assets are currently mobilized and performing work on a separately awarded contract to remove and replace defective and deteriorated liners in the dikes which surround the fuel storage tanks.  Time is of the essence to bring the tanks into compliance with code and to prohibit further interference with the 12th Flying Training Wing’s flying mission.  Laguna will be able to replace / install the alarm systems concurrently with their current work preventing further delays.  Furthermore, should a different contractor be awarded this purchase order, they would have to remove portions of the liner installed by Laguna, hence, voiding their warranty.  For the above reasons, the Government has determined that it is in their best interest to award this requirement sole source to Laguna.  All responsible sources who can provide the above requirement at prices, terms and conditions, equal to or better than those which can be provided by Laguna Construction Company, to include timliness of work and assuming of all future warranties of Laguna’s existing contract should submit clear and convincing data in writing substantiating an ability to furnish the entire requirement.  All responses to this notice must be received by this office by 6 Feb 09.  Responses should be sent to the following address:  12 CONS/LGCA; Attn: 1Lt Dave Jenkins; 395B Street West, Ste 2; Randolph AFB, TX; 78150-4525.

<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the area of advanced radar technology that will overcome deficiencies in existing and planned radar systems to detect, track, and identify aircraft, missiles, spacecraft, space debris, ground vehicles, and subsurface complexes in clutter and countermeasure environments. The survivability of new and existing systems must also be improved without the use of decoys. Upgrades to existing Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Platforms and demonstrations to support transition to the next level of technology development, and evolutions to new sensors and concepts (Unmanned Air Vehicles, Space Based Platforms, etc.) need to be addressed. Sensor concepts should include multiple configurations with characteristics supporting diverse multimission requirements including Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI), Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Multiband SAR/Tomographic Imaging features, and Foliage Penetrating (FOPEN) Radar. These concepts include both Monostatic and Multistatic solutions. Lookdown Bistatic concepts should include bistatic receivers using radiators of opportunity (TV, FM etc.) with large wideband receive antennas. Areas of interest include new and innovative advances in system architectures, hardware, software and/or signal processing algorithm improvements, diverse transmit waveforms, survivability, positional estimation improvements, unique concepts in radar system design, Multi-Basing Look Down Surveillance (Air and Space), Augmentation of Reconnaissance Capabilities (development of new surveillance capabilities in Reconnaissance sensors), Ground Penetrating Radar, Bistatic/Multistatic Radar (Non-cooperative emitter stand alone sensors and Cooperative augmentation of existing ISR Platforms through UAVs), the architecture and signal processing for expendable UAV radar probes and theater missile defense.

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, in which Criteria 1-3 are of equal importance and Criteria 4 is of lesser importance than Criteria 1-3, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall scientific and technical merits, (2) Innovativeness of the approach and/or technologies, (3) Applicability to military electronic systems, (4) Reasonableness and Realism of Proposed Costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:</p>

<CONTACT>Kiel Anderson kiel.anderson@hanscom.af.mil

<a href="mailto:kiel.anderson@hanscom.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>EXTENSION OF DCGS INTEGRATION SUPPPORT CONTRACT (DISC) F19628-01-C-0047. This announcement constitutes a Notice of Proposed Contract Action (NOCA) for a non-competitive Cost Plus Award Fee modification for the purpose of extending the contract period of performance and increasing the contract value of the DCGS Integration Support Contract (DISC), F19628-01-C-0047, with General Dynamics Automated Information Systems (GDAIS, formerly Verdian Systems).  The current period of performance ends 31 December 2009.  The new period of performance will be 1 January 2010 through 31 December 2010, with one option year for the period 1 January 2011 through 31 December 2011. The estimated cost of the contract will increase by $20M.
The contract extension with the incumbent contractor, General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, is for the continuation of critical Systems Engineering, Network Engineering, Configuration and Baseline Management, Process Improvement, and Site Activation operations and capabilities for the AF DCGS Program Office.  This extension is required to ensure seamless systems integration support for the installation and integration of Block 10.2 and to avoid any further delays to the current Block 10.2 schedule.  The Government requires seamless, uninterrupted support in network communications and site activation services.  Due to warfighter requirements changes, which were beyond the Government's and the current DISC contractor's control, the Block 10.2 field installation and integration schedule has been delayed, thus requiring an extension to the DISC contract period of performance.
The authority for this action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, and it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  If a firm believes they are capable of fully satisfying the Government's requirements, they may identify their interest and capability to 950th ELSG/PK, Attn:  Patricia Forest, phone (781) 266-1048 or e-mail pat.forest@hanscom.af.mil.  Responses are due no later than 15 days from the date of publication.  Please direct any question regarding this synopsis to Patricia Forest, Contracting Officer, (781) 266-1048 or Kiel Anderson, Contract Specialist, kiel.anderson@hanscom.af.mil.
An ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  Before consulting the Ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendation to the Contracting Officer for resolution.

<SUBJECT>NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB): Bi-SC AIS TMID Capability 1 Services - Air C2IS Increment 1 Enhancements 
<SOLNBR>IFB-CO-12556-AirC2IS-E

<DESC><p>In June 2008, the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) announced that it was inviting bids for the development and delivery of Increment 1 of the Air Command and Control Information Services (Air C2IS) in Support of Air Staffs. NC3A has not yet released this Invitation for Bid (IFB-CO-12556-AirC2IS).</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Infrastructure Committee has authorized a project to develop and implement Theatre Missile Defense (TMD) specific functionality in the Bi-Strategic Command Automated Information System (Bi-SC AIS). Project 2006/0IS03073, "Bi-SC AIS TMD Capability 1 Services" stems from the Capability Package "Provide NATO Wide Theatre Missile Defense Capabilities." This project will be implemented in two increments and only the first increment has been authorized. The first increment of Bi-SC AIS TMD Capability 1 requires the enhancement of the planned Air C2IS Increment 1. The TMD enhancement requirements will be added to the Air C2IS Increment 1 requirements and this combined package will be procured through one International Competitive Bidding (ICB) process.</p>
<p>The Bi-SC AIS TMD services will be used by operational staffs at strategic command, joint force command, and component commands, as well as the deployable Combined Joint Task Force and NATO Reaction Force headquarters. The services will allow planners in the Bi-SC AIS domain to interface with TMD staffs at Combined Air Operations Center level in order to develop coherent and feasible TMD defense designs that can give a high degree of confidence that mission objectives for protecting assets and forces can be achieved.</p>
<p>The Air C2IS Increment 1 TMD enhancement will then serve as the baseline for further expanded TMD capability in subsequent increments. As already described for Air C2IS, it is envisioned that, provided the successful delivery of each preceding increment and subject to agreement on scope and price for each subsequent increment and formal authorization being granted by NATO authorities, the selected contractor would be retained for each of the subsequent increments. The project will be subject to the Two Stage Authorization Procedure.</p>
<p>As this will be a combined procurement with Air C2IS Increment 1, the envisaged bidding procedure will be an ICB with Best Value (BV) evaluation using the BV criteria agreed to for Air C2IS.</p>
<p>The Invitation for Bid relevant to the acquisition subject of this letter will be identified as IFB-CO-12556-AirC2IS and all correspondence concerning this solicitation should reference this identifier.</p>
<p>Please note that the IFB, at the time of its issuance, will contain an exclusion provision concerning the Bi-SC AIS Program Management and Integration Capability (PMIC) contract.</p>
<p>Also, an exclusion provision will be inserted in the IFB with respect to the possibility of the awardee of the AirC2IS (with TMD enhancement) contract to perform at any tier on any Independent Verification and Validation efforts associated with the AirC2IS project.</p>
<p>The rough cost estimate for the implementation component of Air C2IS Increment 1 capability TMD enhancements is Euro 17,630,000. This makes a combined rough cost estimate of Euro 28,995,000 for the complete IFB. To this extent, the amounts of the bids submitted in response to the IFB shall not exceed 125 percent of the authorized amount for the project.</p>
<p>NC3A has extended the deadline for nominations to the bidders list for IFB-CO-12556-AirC2IS. In addition to those U.S. firms already nominated to the Air C2IS bidders list, the U.S. Government will nominate additional U.S. firms that have been pre-approved for participation in NATO ICB. Please refer to the Bidding Procedure section of this announcement for more information.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the contracting agency for NATO ICB projects. Its role is to approve for participation in NATO ICB those facilities that are located within the United States. Only facilities that have first been approved for participation in NATO ICB may be nominated to the bidders list for a NATO ICB project. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval:</p>

<p>the title and/or solicitation number of the project</p>
<p>the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>Using the contact information indicated on the DOE, the NATO contracting agency will contact the firm directly when the IFB has been issued.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DEADLINES<br /><br />1. Final date to request a Declaration of Eligibility: 03 February 2009<br /><br />2. Anticipated date that the contracting agency will distribute the IFB: late March/April 2009</p>

<SUBJECT>Dako Autostainer Plus Link System
<SOLNBR>NCI-90041-KM
<RESPDATE>020509
<CONTACT>Karri L. Mares, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014357774, Fax 301-402-4513, Email maresk@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Pathology (LP), plans to procure on a sole source basis the brand name Dako Autostainer Plus Link System from Dako North America; 6392 Via Real; Carpinteria, CA 93013-2921, USA.

This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority FAR 13.501 to use simplified acquisition procedures for commercial items.

The North American Industry Classification System code for this acquisition is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

The Laboratory of Pathology, NCI produces and analyzes tissue microarrays (TMAs). An element of this work is the performance of immunohistochemical (IHC) assays on TMAs. The application of automation improves throughput as well as reproducibility of the IHC assay. Acquisition of an open system automated IHC instrument with customer controlled and defined bar-codes and high capacity will enable both throughput and tracking. 

The salient characteristics for the required system are as follows:

	1. Immunohistochemical Stainer Robot that is an Open System - including the 	features:
		a. User programmable
		b. Does not require utilization of specified reagents
		c. Does not require the use of liquid cover-slip technology (an issue with 			    TMA staining) 

	2. Barcode reading enabled with the following features:
		a. 2-D bar codes
		b. Reads bar codes provided by user (compared to defined by 				    manufacturer)
		c. Included bar code reading and tracking of both slides and reagents
		d. 48 slide capacity

PART II. Facts and Reasons To Justify Other than Full And Open Competition

1.	Statute: 13.106-1 (b)(2)

(b) Solicitation from a single source.  

(2)	For Sole source acquisition of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.

2.	Sole Source Justification

Dako North America is the only company known to the NCI that offers an instrument that meets the above specifications. Unique elements are the bar-code technologies allowing integration of user-defined barcoding on specimens and the open platform for the use of any reagents. The system is such that other assays, including in situ hybridizations and assays on protein and antibody arrays can be programmed on the instrument. This system also has continuity and shared platform of consumables with existing instrument in the NCI laboratory at current time.  For consistency of the ongoing research studies, it is critical that the laboratory maintain its current methodologies and reagents.  The instrument must be "open", allowing the NCI to use any specified reagents in the current assays.  Any instrument that requires specific reagents for operation does not provide the capacity to move current assays on to a new system. Any change in reagents or methods could significantly interfere with ongoing projects, and potentially require the restaining and analysis of thousands of slides at a significant expense to the government. 

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the requirement as detailed they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office on or before 11:00 am ET, on February 5, 2009.  All questions must be in writing and must be emailed to Karri Mares at maresk@mail.nih.gov faxed to (301) 402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov    In addition; contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference NCI-90041-KM on all correspondence.

The Government intends to make a s! ingle award to the responsible Offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government considering price and price related factors. In accordance with the FAR clause 52.212-2, the following information applies: (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
Factor I - Technical
Capability of the proposed item to meet the requirements of the solicitation
Factor II - Past Performance
Factor III - Price
Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor I above, which represents the minimum acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, the proposal will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below.
Only those offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor I will be further evaluated under Factors II and III.  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor I to be technically acceptable, Factor II is significantly less important than Factor III.
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore, contain the offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
(b) Technical capability will be assessed by evaluating the information submitted in response to FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, as amended above.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the statement of work and purchase description included in this solicitation.
Items offered, as provided in the offeror's technical proposal, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award
(c) Offerors' past performance information submitted, as required by the proposal contents information set fort above, will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should therefore provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to five similar contracts.
The Contracting Officer will valuate Past Performance as follows:NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directy related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.
OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance.
SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.
MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.
All responsible Offerors are to submit current pricing, delivery time, payment terms, cage code, Dunn and Bradstreet number, Tax Identification Number and all applicable specifications regarding this solicitation. Provide copies of applicable commercially published price lists pertaining to your company's products that meet the specifications, along with applicable government discounts.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Construction and Leasing Of Office/Laboratory Space

Pre-Solicitation Announcement

The Federal Government has a requirement for the construction and full service leasing of a new Wildlife Disease Research Building (WDRB) to be located at 4101 LaPorte Avenue, Fort Collins, Colorado on land to be leased from Colorado State University.  The building will be occupied entirely by U.S. Department of Agriculture and other Federal tenants as determined by the General Services Administration.

The National Wildlife Research Center (NRWC) presently has a long term ground lease with Colorado State University.  The successful Offeror will enter into a ground lease with the University and a full service building lease with the General Services Administration (GSA).  The proposed building shall contain approximately 13,000 BOMA office area (useable) square feet of office and laboratory space for use by the tenant for personnel, furnishings, equipment, and public use areas.  The space shall be designed and constructed to meet the requirements of a self-contained Bio-Safety Level (BSL)-3 Laboratory and BSL-3 Ag animal holding and testing space.  The building must be capable of being fully accessible to the physically handicapped, must meet minimum seismic requirements and will be subject to any and all other building or construction rules, regulations, laws and/or ordinances on the local, county, state and federal levels as they may apply.

The Government may enter into a sole source procurement with Colorado State University in the event interested party(ies) are unable to indicate they are highly qualified to meet the Government’s requirements for past performance.  In making such a determination, GSA will consider past performance factors including the ability to finance, develop, construct and provide full service operation of facilities of similar complexity.  Interested parties will also need to provide evidence that they are able to secure the necessary land lease from CSU.  

The government is seeking a 20-year firm term lease with two 5-year options.  The General Service Administration does not have the Authority or does not intend to seek authority to award a lease that exceeds the congressionally imposed Prospectus Threshold.  Such space shall be ready for occupancy no later than fall of 2012.

Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any Expressions of Interests or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building’s ownership. 

A written statement of interest should be submitted by February 20, 2009  to: Dan McPherson, c/o General Services Administration, Colorado Service Center (8PC), P. O.

This system specification leverages the product interoperability standards defined by the SDI-12 Serial Digital Interface Standard together with commercial 802.3 Ethernet infrastructure. The dam structures present unique difficulties due to their large physical size and widely separated placement of<BR>sensors and displays on the structures. Electronic equipment at such facilities is vulnerable to lightning damage,corrosion and other hazards.<BR>The SDI-12 (Serial Data Interface Standard at 1200 baud) is well suited for applications of this nature and is specified as the field-bus for this project. SDI-12 is a serial digital communication standard for interfacing data recorders with<BR>microprocessor-based sensors. SDI-12 sensors and instrumentation are used widely within the Corps of Engineers Hydraulics and Hydrology (H&H) divisions. THIS RFP HAS BEEN SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS.  THE DESIGNATED NAICS CODE IS 334519 AND THE SIZE STANDARD IS 500 EMPLOYEES. THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS INTENDS TO NEGOTIATE A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISTION PROCEDURES WITH FAR SUBPART 13.5 - TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS, AND AWARD A FIRM FIXED PRICE PURCHASE ORDER WITH A PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE FROM THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF AWARD THROUGH 90 DAYS THEREAFTER.  THE RFP WILL BE ISSUED AND POSTED ON FedBizOpps ON OR ABOUT 11 FEBRUARY 2009.

If a meeting requires an overnight stay the contractor will be reimbursed at Government rates for necessary travel expenses. These may include mileage for driving a personal vehicle, air travel, or daily per diem.  No travel costs will be paid for meetings held in Portland, Oregon.  Must prepare draft versions of meeting notes for distribution and comments by the WPKK group. Drafts will be distributed electronically. Comments will be supplied to the contractor electronically.

This is a Request for Information to identify qualified businesses and potential business arrangements for the possible procurement of Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I), Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), and, Assembly, Integration, and Test (AI&amp;T) services to be located at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, in support of the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Office's proposed ORS Rapid Reaction Space Works (also known as the "Chile Works"). <br />Background
<p>Pursuant to Section 913(b) of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Public Law 109-364) and as directed by the Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF) on May 17, 2007, the ORS Office was established under the authority, direction, and control of the DoD Executive Agent for Space (DoD EA for Space).</p>
<p>The DOD defined ORS as "Assured space power focused on timely satisfaction of Joint Force Commanders' needs." <br /><br />The ORS Office's mission is to plan and prepare for the rapid development of highly responsive space capabilities which enable delivery of timely warfighting effects and, when directed, develop and support deployment and operations of these capabilities in order to enhance and assure the support to Joint Force Commanders' and other users' needs for on-demand space support, augmentation, and reconstitution.</p>
<p>The ORS Office is tasked establish the ability to provide rapid end-to-end capability efforts to meet urgent operational needs of the Joint Force Commanders (JFCs). The ORS Office plans to standup this capability over time with a phased "crawl", "walk", and "run" approach. The responsiveness is defined in terms of Tiers. These tiers, described below, are distinguished by the length of time required to deliver ORS capabilities. Achieving the timelines may not be possible at the outset, but will remain an important goal as the ORS program matures:</p>
<p>- Tier 1: EMPLOY: On-demand use of existing deployed assets in applications that may extend or expand their original purpose. The objective of Tier 1 is to deliver these capabilities within minutes to hours. Other elements of the National Security Space (NSS) community have the primary responsibility for identifying and executing Tier 1 initiatives.</p>
<p>- Tier 2: DEPLOY: Deploying new or additional capabilities that are "field-ready", that is, already produced. The objective of Tier 2 is to deliver capabilities within days to weeks.</p>
<p>- Tier 3: DEVELOP: The rapid development, delivery, and employment of a new capability. The objective of Tier 3 is to deliver capabilities within months and less than one year. The ORS Tier 3 strategy comprises the primary office activity focused on maturing the ORS enabling elements.</p>
<p>Anticipated initial mission types include:<br />LEO (Low earth orbit): <br />- Tactical Surveillance<br />- Electro-Optical Visible/Near Infrared Imager (EO/VNIR)<br />- EO/Shortwave-Infrared Imager (EO/SWIR)<br />- Hyperspectral Imager (HSI)<br />- Deep Space Object Search and Track (DS SSA)<br />- Synthetic aperture radar</p>
<p>- Space Situational Awareness<br />- Space Protection<br /><br />HEO (Highly elliptical orbit):<br />- Tactical communications <br />- SATCOM <br />- Blue Force Tracking (BFT)<br />- Tactical Surveillance<br />- Kinetic event detection battlespace awareness<br />GEO (Geosynchronous Earth orbit):<br />- Space Situational Awareness<br />- Space Protection</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to identify possible sources and obtain general research information that may aid the government with potential future acquisitions aimed at supporting the ORS Office's mission. The ORS Rapid Reaction Space Works is initially to be co-located within the existing Satellite Assembly and Test buildings at Kirtland Air Force Base.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE #SOT01.21.2009KR

 “Independent Assessment of Technology Characterizations to Support the Biomass Program Annual State-of-Technology Assessments”


I.  BACKGROUND

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is providing Systems Integration (SI) for the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Office of the Biomass Program (OBP).  This support includes developing and implementing standardized approaches for tracking the progress toward established technical targets/goals. OBP conducts annual State of Technology (SOT) assessments that provide the basis for setting OBP technical targets and cost goals, quantifying technology progress, identifying process improvement needs, and comparing the economics of cellulosic ethanol with other alternative fuels. Historically, OBP’s SOT assessments have been based almost exclusively on bench- and pilot-scale data generated from OBP-sponsored research and development (R&D) conducted at the National Laboratories. This work covers a portion of OBP’s portfolio and is at relatively early stages of development compared to the industrially-led projects that OBP is co-funding under EPACT 2005 Section 932. The NREL SI is helping OBP improve its SOT assessments by (1) developing a standardized methodology and timeline for annual updating of technical inputs into SOT metrics for cellulosic ethanol production, (2) incorporating lab- and large-scale integrated industrial-led project data into the SOT assessments, and (3) expanding the scope of the SOT assessments to include additional biofuels and environmental metrics (e.g., greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water impacts). 

II. OBJECTIVE

The goal of a potential project would be to better define, track and communicate the status and progress of cellulosic biofuel production processes. The key project objectives would be to (1) establish a transparent and straightforward approach to assess and synthesize process and economic data from DOE and non-DOE (as available) projects at a range of scales—as the basis for generating consistent and comparable annual State of Technology (SOT) metrics for specified feedstock-conversion-biofuel combinations; (2) synthesize and document the current SOT of specified feedstock-conversion-biofuel combinations; (3) establish future SOT targets for each feedstock-conversion-biofuel combination; and (4) build on this framework to quickly and consistently assess and compare new concepts and technologies.

III. POTENTIAL TASK AREAS

Task Area 1:  Data Collection and Documentation 

As directed by NREL, a potential Subcontractor would collect and evaluate process and economic data relevant to seven specified feedstock-conversion-biofuel combinations. Subtask areas might include: (1) examination of the research and deployment activities that have been accomplished to date and activities that are currently underway; and (2) evaluation of the future potential for cost reductions.  

Task Area 2:  SOT Data Requirements and Reporting Framework

A potential Subcontractor would develop a common set of technical, economic and data quality metrics to define the state-of-technology for each of the specified feedstock-conversion-biofuel combinations. Subtask areas might include: (1) definition of required SOT input data based on project process and economic data; (2) development of data quality metrics (based on a standard approach such as stage gate management or technology readiness level (TRL));,(3) development of a consistent reporting methodology and transparent, easy-to-update tool that would incorporate the technical, economic and data quality metrics to document, track and accurately communicate the SOT over time. 

Task Area 3:  Process Simulation and Economic Models

A potential Subcontractor would develop and document transparent, standardized “plug and play” process and economic models to consistently assess and compare the SOT of specified feedstock-conversion-biofuel combinations. Subtask areas might include development of APSEN-based process simulation models and spreadsheet-based economic models to facilitate incorporation and analysis of annual SOT data updates and quick-turn around analysis of new conceptual designs and technologies.

Task Area 4:  Data Analysis and SOT Documentation

A potential Subcontractor would conduct analyses of specified feedstock-conversion-biofuel combinations on an annual basis and new concepts as they are identified, based on the data and models from task areas 2 and 3.  This task would require analysis (via ASPEN and economic spreadsheet models) and documentation of the current and future SOT technical and economic parameters for each of the defined combinations. 

Task Area 5:  Quick Turnaround Support

A potential Subcontractor would be required to provide quick turnaround support by analyzing new concepts, based on the approaches, models and reporting framework developed in Tasks 1-4 for the initial analyses of the specified feedstock-conversion-biofuel combinations. The new concepts would be assessed and documented as described in Tasks 1-4.

III. AREAS OF EXPERTISE:  Individuals or organizations responding to this Sources Sought request must describe capabilities, attributes, and skills in one or more of the following specific areas of expertise in which assistance in systematically assessing, comparing and documenting the state-of-technology for biomass conversion processes can be provided.  Respondents should indentify their level of expertise in the cover page of their submission. A) Contacts in and associations with the emerging cellulosic bioindustry.  B) Process and economic data collection/synthesis (relevant to biomass conversion processes). C) State of technology metrics development, implementation and tracking (relevant to biofuels production processes). D) Technical and economic data quality assessment and data quality metric development, including stage gate management or technology readiness assessment implementation. E) Technical and economic model development for biofuels production (biochemical and thermochemical) processes. F) Analysis and documentation of key technical and economic parameters for biofuels production processes.

IV:  RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:  The response to this sources sought document is limited to eight (8) pages of single spaced text of 12-point Arial font or equivalent, with minimum 1” margins all around. Brevity is encouraged.  Any organization interested in working with NREL to provide the technical expertise described within this document should mail a profile of qualifications, based on the Areas of Expertise listed above, to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Attn:  Kathee Flanagan Roque, 1617 Cole Boulevard - MS 1533, Golden, CO 80401-3393.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT Notice issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Office of Information Services and Office of Administration, to conduct a market survey and analysis to determine the range of organizations that have the capabilities to perform the project work titled, “Information Technology Infrastructure and Support Services” (ITISS) as described below.  

This is not a Request for Proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract.  The purpose of this announcement is to provide potential sources the opportunity to provide a capability statement along with answers to specific market survey questions in order to demonstrate related experience and ability to perform the work described herein.  All interested parties, including large businesses and all categories of small businesses (small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses) are encouraged to respond.

Background

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was created as an independent agency by Congress in 1974 to enable the nation to safely use radioactive materials for beneficial civilian purposes while ensuring that people and the environment are protected.  It regulates commercial nuclear power plants and other uses of nuclear materials (such as in nuclear medicine) through licensing, inspection and enforcement of its requirements.  The NRC’s headquarters are in Rockville, Maryland, and it has multiple offices within the Continental United States (CONUS).  The agency’s current IT infrastructure services vehicle (NRC-DR-01-290; NRC ADAMS Accession #: ML012850130) expires on September 27, 2010.

The NRC intends to acquire services and support for its IT environment from a contractor.  The NRC requires this contractor to integrate the current NRC IT environment into a centrally managed enterprise system capable of providing support 24 hr/day, 7 day/week, and 365 days/year, along with the ability to address future enhancement, modernization, and technology change.  The contract envisioned by the NRC will include primarily the following Information Technology Infrastructure Library version 3 (ITIL v3) service areas (in partnership with the NRC):

 
1 	Service Strategy 
1.4 	Demand Management 

2 	Service Design 
2.1 	Service Catalog Management 
2.2 	Service Design 
2.3 	Service Level Management 
2.4 	Capacity Management 
2.5 	Availability Management 
2.6 	IT Service Continuity 
2.7 	Information Security Management 

3 	Service Transition 
3.1 	Service Asset and Configuration Management 
3.2 	Transition Planning and Support 
3.3 	Release and Deployment Management 
3.4 	Change Management 
3.5 	Knowledge Management 

4 	Service Operation 
4.1 	Event Management 
4.2 	Incident Management 
4.3 	Problem Management 
4.4 	Request Fulfillment 
4.5 	Service Desk 
4.6 	Technical, Application, and Operations Management 

5 	Continual Service Improvement (CSI)
 
Potential prime contractors and their sub-contractors should be prepared to deliver capabilities to include (but not limited to): network operations, desktop and laptop management, hardware provisioning, software licensing, service desk, architecture support, network and workstation development and integration, telecommunications, data center management.  Special considerations must be made for both high availability of these services as well as disaster recovery capabilities and services.

The NRC is in the process of planning for the follow-on contract that will be needed to provide ongoing agency-wide ITISS.  An Industry Day is planned in the near future (the date of which will be posted on this site at a later time) where potential vendors will be invited to get a better understanding of NRC requirements.

The NRC currently has 3,400 employees.  2,500 of theses employees are based at the NRC headquarters offices in five buildings in or around Rockville, Maryland. 735 of the employees are based at four regional offices and our Technical training center (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/locations.html):

1.	King of Prussia, PA (211 staff);
2.	Atlanta, GA (175 staff);
3.	Lisle, IL (189 staff);
4.	Arlington, TX (160); and,
5.	The Technical Training Center (TTC) in Chattanooga, TN (28 staff).

In addition, the agency network infrastructure extends to approximately 200 employees based at various nuclear plant sites around the United States (see http://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/reactor).
 
Responses to Sources Sought Notice

The NRC is seeking commercial organizations capable of providing agency-wide ITISS in prime and/or sub-contractor roles. Responses to this notice shall include:

1.	A capability statement not to exceed two pages in length (8.5” x 11” letter sized) detailing the respondent’s related current and prior work experience, and corporate qualifications.  Respondents must include information to document experience and expertise in enterprise ITISS as well as support and management processes (i.e., ITIL, CMMI, etc.) within a performance-based (“incentivized”) federal environment.
 
2.	Completion of the questionnaire included with this synopsis (Excel format).

Any organization responding to this SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE must ensure its response is complete and sufficiently detailed.  A government employee will review all submissions for responsiveness to this notice.  The Government does not intend to award a contract based on this submission to the Sources Sought Notice nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this announcement.

Responses are due no later than February 6, 2009 by 12:00 noon (local time). Telephone inquiries or responses will not be accepted. Responses and/or inquiries should be sent via e-mail to ITISS@nrc.gov with the subject line, “SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE – NRC ITISS.”

The irradiator is used to irradiate pink bollworm moths to induce sexual sterility. The sterilized insects are then released as part of the International PBW Eradication Program.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole-source basis, a commercial firm-fixed-price contract to Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI) for its ArcGIS Situational Awareness Bundle (SAB). This non-competitive action is being issued by the Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate.
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The NAICS for this requirement is proposed as 511210.
The Department of the Interior (DOI) has a requirement for an ArcGIS Situational Awareness Bundle (SAB). The SAB provides a complete framework for geospatial intelligence and decision making. It provides DOI the capability to gain a timely and accurate understanding of their operations and events that impact them.  The SAB includes the turnkey solution, implementation services, training, and maintenance support. The SAB utilizes and builds on the ESRI ArcGIS software capabilities that DOI has previously acquired and no other system fully meets the DOI's need for a fully functional turn-key solution. The period of performance for this effort is one base year and one option year.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is AG-7MN1-S-09-0001 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The NAICS is 444220, business size is $6.5 million.  This solicitation document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-28.

The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Kika de la Garza Subtropical Agricultural Research Laboratory, Weslaco, Texas has a need for Nursery grown Arunda donax plants.  The laboratory requires 13,000 plants to be delivered 250 per week over a 52 week period.  The following will detail the specific requirements.  Arundo donax L., giant reed is an exotic and invasive weed of riparian habitats and irrigation canals of the Rio Grande River Basin and the southwestern U.S.  Arundo dominates these habitats, which leads to: loss of biodiversity; catastrophic stream bank erosion; damage to bridges; increased costs for chemical and mechanical control along transportation corridors, and impedes law enforcement activities on the international border. Additionally, this invasive weed competes for water resources in an arid region where these resources are critical to the environment, agriculture and municipal users.  Biological control using insects from the native range of Arundo may be the best option for long-term management of this weed. Arundo donax is a good target for biological control because it has no close relatives in North or South America, and several of the plant-feeding insects from its native range in Mediterranean Europe are known to be specialists feeding only on this one plant species.  USDA-ARS has an on-going biological control program for Arundo.  Additional plant production of Arundo is needed for use in the insect mass-rearing program.  1) Contractor will grow Arundo donax plants in 3 gallon plants. 2) Contractor will provide weekly deliveries (every Monday) of 250, 3 gallon pots of Arundo donax plants. 3) Contractor will deliver healthy Arundo donax plants with shoots between 1 and 2 feet tall, no shorter or taller. 4) Contractor must obtain prior approval from USDA, ARS to apply any insecticides to plants. (NO insecticide use without prior approval.) 5) Arundo donax plants must be grown from Arundo donax rhizomes (4-8 inches long) field harvested by the Contractor from the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. 5) Plants must be grown in an enclosed and heated greenhouse that will not have any insecticide use on other crops.  Greenhouses must be capable of maintaining a minimum average temperature of 80 degrees F during winter. 7) Plants must be grown from rhizomes that are no older than 1 month from field harvest. 8) Contractor will deliver plants to greenhouse facilities at USDA, APHIS, Moore Airbase, 22675 N. Moorefield Rd., Edinburg, TX 78541. 9) USDA reserves the right to cancel the contract with two months prior notice. 10) Period of the performance is 52 weeks.

Price to include delivery to the USDA, APHIS, Moore Airbase, 22675 N Moorefield Road, Edinburg, Texas 78541.

There shall be no evidence of damage to the pallets, shipping containers or products when stack is tested on the rigid surface for a minimum of 24 hours, in compliance with all the National and Local Safety Regulations. The pre-tested palletized load configuration shall be duplicated using the same packaging materials, pattern, number of shipping (transport) containers, and procedures consistent throughout the duration of the contract. Palletized loads shall be stable and safe when handled with mechanical equipment by qualified personnel.

Materials:  All lumber used inside or outside a shipment shall be bark free. No used wood pallets with repaired components or stringers will be acceptable. All wood pallet stringers shall be manufactured from hardwoods.  Pallets manufactured of materials other than wood, shall conform to all the requirements specified herein.

Unitization:  For the purpose of this requirement, the assembled group of containers or items in a single load that can be handled as a unit throughout the distribution system. Unitization encompasses, but is not limited to, consolidation in a container, placement on a pallet or load base having forklift capability, or securely binding together. Shipments should be considered for unitization where appropriate or specified.

Unitization of pallet load:  The palletized load shall be unitized and secured to the pallet to insure that the load arrives intact without product damage. The containers or items shall be placed in a suitable pattern to form a stable and balanced load. Vertical, horizontal or filler reinforcement shall be added as necessary to meet the stacking strength requirements. A palletized load shall be secured to the pallet by shrink or stretch wrapping, and/or, by steel or nonmetallic strapping. When steel or nonmetallic strapping is used, edge protectors shall be provided to prevent damage to the cartons when tensioning the strapping. As a minimum, two straps shall run lengthwise, two straps shall run widthwise, and two straps shall run around the girth of the palletized load. A palletized load shall be capable of protecting the products against damage in a multiple handling, transportation, and storage environment having distribution warehouses with rack systems that support the load/s overhead of warehouse personnel.

Notice of special requirements for shipment to all countries that have endorsed the IPPC Guidelines for treatment of non-manufactured wood packaging:  The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) has approved and published on March 15, 2002, “Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International Trade”.

<DESC>NIDA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Mississippi to increase the number of marijuana samples to be analyzed under its current contract number HHSN271200577461C.  This increase in work will not extend the current expiration date of the contract.  Statutory authority to justify this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  Awarding this effort to anyone other than the current contractor would result in a substantial duplication of costs to the Government that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and would result in delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.  

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the 
Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
	
The Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Statement of Work


The intent of this statement of work (SOW) is to provide a full range of services needed and original approaches for performing surveillance of the contract security guard services at various locations throughout the National Institutes of Health (NIH), on and off campus in the local area (Washington-Baltimore). This surveillance will determine whether security Guard Force contract requirements are in compliance with the contract specifications and identify potential improvement opportunities. 

Ia.  Scope:
The NIH seeks a contractor who is knowledgeable and has not less than three years experience in the field of Quality Assurance Inspections/Surveillance as related to the security field and performance based contracts. The contractor will be tasked with staffing and conducting around the clock (24/7) inspections/surveillance of the NIH contractor guard force delivery of services. These inspections will consist of random, scheduled and unscheduled inspections, conducted during all hours of the day and night, including holidays, weekends, and periods of inclement weather. Inspections/surveillance will be performed at all NIH facilities in the local area (Washington-Baltimore) that have contract Guard forces assigned. There are currently 23 separate posts on campus and 20 off campus sites with contract Guards assigned that total approximately 500 personnel on all shifts. Several of these sites are staffed with contract Guards 24 hours a day. The location and the number of posts are subject to change. Included in the inspection process will be surreptitious attempts to penetrate the various levels of the contractor’s security at perimeter vehicle entrance and building entrances using methods which should be readily detected by alert guards trained by the contractor and NIH. The contractor will also conduct inspections of administrative tasks as required (reports, schedules, etc.). Performance monitoring will be conducted at any NIH facility with contract Guard personnel on and off campus in the Washington- Baltimore area. The contractor will document their performance daily of all evaluations and locations by adding their data to one or more electronic databases’/datafiles. The contractor should practice effective resource management as part of their daily work effort.

II.	Background as defined by the NIH mission statement
NIH is the steward of medical and behavioral research for the Nation. Its mission is science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.
The goals of the agency are as follows: 	
•	foster fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis to advance significantly the Nation’s capacity to protect and improve health 
•	develop, maintain, and renew scientific human and physical resources that will assure the Nation’s capability to prevent disease 
•	expand the knowledge base in medical and associated sciences in order to enhance the Nation’s economic well-being and ensure a continued high return on the public investment in research 
•	exemplify and promote the highest level of scientific integrity, public accountability, and social responsibility in the conduct of science.
In realizing these goals, the NIH provides leadership and direction to programs designed to improve the health of the Nation, and protection of the Nation and its citizens in the area of bio-defense, by conducting and supporting research in: 
•	the causes, diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases
•	the processes of human growth and development
•	the biological effects of environmental contaminants
•	the understanding of mental, addictive and physical disorders
•	directing programs for the collection, dissemination, and exchange of information in medicine and health, including the development and support of medical libraries and the training of medical librarians and other health information specialists.
The Office of Research Services (ORS) provides services to the NIH Community that support its mission of uncovering new knowledge about the prevention, detection, diagnosis, identification and treatment of disease and disability. Those services range from providing animal care and facilities, to library and conference services, to services related to security and safety. ORS supports all 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) that operate in multiple locations, including the primary location on the Bethesda campus.

The Guard Force Operations Branch of the NIH Police is responsible for providing and administering contract guard services at specific buildings and entrances both on and off campus to supplement security systems and/or law enforcement personnel. 

 The Office of Quality Management(OQM) assists the ORS leaders in their customer     
 service and organizational improvement efforts through education, consultation, 
 information sharing and technical advice. The OQM provides the Guard Force Operations Branch of the NIH Police with direct surveillance of the contract Guard Force by providing an experienced Quality Assurance evaluation staff.

	(h) 	Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689).  (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.)  The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals–
	
(1)	[   ] Are, [   ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 

(2)	[   ] Have, [   ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
	
	
(3)	[   ] Are [   ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4)	[   ] Have, [   ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i)	Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

	(A)	The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
	(B)	The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii)	Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

	(B)	The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.  Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
	(C)	The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
	(D)	The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
	
	(i) 	Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination.  The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose.  This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records.  The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided.
	
	(m)	Termination for cause.  The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance.  In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law.  If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.
	
	(n)	Title.  Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession.
	
	(o)	Warranty.  The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract.
	
	(p)	Limitation of liability.  Except as otherwise provided by an express warranty, the Contractor will not be liable to the Government for consequential damages resulting from any defect or deficiencies in accepted items.
	
	(q)	Other compliances.  The Contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this contract.

	(s)	Order of precedence.  Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order: (1) the schedule of supplies/services; (2) the Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, and Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts paragraphs of this clause; (3) the clause at 52.212-5; (4) addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software; (5)  solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation; (6) other paragraphs of this clause; (7) the Standard Form 1449; (8) other documents, exhibits, and attachments; and (9) the specification.
	
	(t) 	Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
	
		(1) 	Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
	

	(2) 	(i) 	If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.  The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
	
			(ii) 	If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
	
		(3) 	The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
	
		(4) 	Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov  or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

<DESC>Female Genital Cutting (FGC) has been recognized by international bodies as a harmful practice and a violation of the human rights of girls and women.  The primary objective of this project is to reduce FGC and other traditional harmful practices in Guinea.   A secondary supporting objective is to increase access to basic health services in the country.   This project will assist the Government of Guinea in implementing their strategy to reinforce and institutionalize efforts to end FGC through better coordination and planning with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) using various communication and education mediums to inform the public about the harmful effects of FGC.  It is the U.S. Government’s (USG) goal to improve human rights in Guinea by developing a broader understanding and increased protection of basic human rights.  While supporting health objectives, this project also will have a Democratic/Governance (D/G) focus, by strengthening civil society knowledge, behavior, and participation, and thereby improving Government of Guinea’s (GOG) accountability, transparency, and efficiency in all systems, particularly the health services sector.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number 172273 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-28. This is a 100% small business set aside. The NAICS code is 561790 Swimming pool cleaning and maintenance services and the size standard as set by the SBA is $7 million. The period of performance will begin at date of award. This Solicitation is compromised of: I. STATEMENT OF WORK II. FORMAT AND SUBMISSION OF PROPOSAL III. EVALUATION FACTORS IV. CONTRACT CLAUSES V. SITE VISIT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR OFFERORS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I. STATEMENT OF WORK The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is for the inspection and repair of the training tank liner, associated fixtures, and any other structural deficiencies in the training tank located in Laurel, Maryland 20708. General The training tank was built in approximately 1988 and is made as an aluminum structure not concrete. It was retrofitted at a later date (approximately 1993) with a pool liner attached to felt and the aluminum surface. The training tank is an Olympic size swimming pool but shorter in dimension by approximately one foot. The contractor shall inspect and repair any deficiencies in the liner of the training tank located in the Wilson Building. This work shall include all labor and materials associated with this project. The Wilson Building training tank is one of the essential training venues at the James J. Rowley Training Center concerning physical fitness and water safety. The training tank (pool) is a major component of the Secret Service physical fitness protocol and is used 365 days a year for training. Therefore, draining of the tank only occurs to rectify maintenance issues. The training tank currently has a leak from an unknown origin or source, causing the liner to pull away from the aluminum structure. This issue has allowed water to bubble between the pool liner and the felt that adheres to the aluminum structure. Due to the present issue, the training tank (pool) has been drained, thus no training can occur until this problem is resolved. It should be noted there is a crawl space around the entire perimeter of the training tank (pool). It is possible that corrosion could be found on the aluminum structure during the inspection. Although this repair is not covered under this contract, it should be brought to the attention of the COTR immediately. Statement of Work The contractor shall provide all necessary equipment, materials and labor for the inspection and repair of the training tank. The contractor shall conduct a complete physical inspection of the structure, crawl spaces, light fixtures, compression flanges/jets, skimmer, tank liner, and felt. The contractor shall remove the water which is currently trapped between the aluminum tank structure and the pool liner/felt. The contractor shall dry out the felt liner to prevent corrosion. Upon completion of inspection, the contractor shall perform the necessary repairs to bring the training tank back into full operation. The contractor shall install two main drain grates in compliance with the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act which shall meet or exceed industry standards in the training tank. Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Technical Representative (COTR) shall approve all material selections prior to installation. Other consideration: All work to be performed by experienced trained personnel employed by a material manufacturer that has been engaged in the formulation and manufacture of reinforced PVC membranes for use in commercial pools for greater than 10 years. House Keeping Contractor shall remove all trash and debris, haul it to an appropriate dumpster, or designated trash site on a daily basis. All areas of work shall be broom swept and kept in an orderly state on a daily basis. Contractor Deliverables All deliveries are the contractor&rsquo;s responsibility. The contractor shall coordinate the deliveries with the Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Technical Representative prior to the delivery, specifying the date and time. The contractor shall be responsible for off and on loading equipment and materials. Upon contract award, the contractor shall submit a safety and health plan (accident prevention plan) for this project, specifically addressing their confined space plan. The inspection and maintenance operations in the crawl spaces around the pool shall be addressed from the standpoint of: atmosphere testing, communication, rescue operations, identification of the competent person, personal protective equipment (PPE), lighting, rescue equipment, etc. In addition, the contractor shall submit MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheets) for all materials being used as part of this project. Special Provisions Contractor personnel proposed to work under this contract shall be US citizens and non-felons. They shall be subject to and successfully pass a police background investigation prior to being admitted to the James J. Rowley Training Center. Upon contract award, the contractor shall be provided with U S Secret Service contractor personnel access forms. Within five (5) days of contract award, the contractor shall submit these completed contractor personnel access forms to the Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Technical Representative. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ II.

<CONTACT>Amy M Wiggins, Contracting Officer, Phone (850)883-3268, Fax (850)882-2533, Email amy.wiggins@eglin.af.mil
<DESC><p>Background</p>
<p>The 808th Armament Systems Group (808 ARSG), 687th Armament Systems Squadron (687 ARSS) contracts with private industry for lethal and non-lethal armament and directed energy technologies.</p>
<p>687 ARSS uses service contractors in fulfilling its mission requirements, including the review of the white paper proposals solicited in this BAA. Service contracts contain an organizational "conflict of interest" clause that requires service contractors to protect the data, and prohibits them from using the data for any other purpose than for which it was presented.</p>
<p>In accordance with AFMCFARS 5327.9001, the Foreign Disclosure Office has determined foreign participation is not authorized.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory and Electronic Systems Center have matured active denial technology over several years. The result brought forth a working technology demonstrator via the Active Denial Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) that completed in September 2007. To arrive at a practical, field-able system design, 808ARSG/687ARSS is leading a Bridge Effort between the end of the ACTD and entering the formal acquisition process as defined in accordance with DoD 5000 series directives and instructions.</p>
<p>687ARSS is currently pursuing acquisition of Active Denial System (ADS) weapon systems by starting a pre-MS B (Pre-EMD) efforts in FY12 with an anticipated competitive two-contractor, award thru Critical <br />Design Review (CDR). This would be followed by a MS B decision and down-select to one contractor to develop and produce a mobile ADS (MADS), initial production is estimated at 20 systems. This is intended as a DoD joint-service (Army, Navy, Air Force) effort, but there is potential for additional production from DoD and other Government agencies.</p>
<p>The intent of this BAA is to address, by way of a study contract, risk reduction for developing a MADS without extensive human effects trials. While there may be reference to and knowledge of versions of the active denial system design currently under test and/or under consideration for deployment, the use of the term "system" in the context of the phrase "active denial system", "Active Denial System", or "ADS" is not intended to represent a particular system designation or system of record. A final material solution to an operational requirement is not within the scope of this work.</p>
<p>WHITE PAPER PROPOSAL PREPARTION</p>
<p>Direct inquiries and send white papers to the following:</p>
<p>Amy M. Wiggins<br />808 ARSG/687 ARSS<br />(850) 883-3268<br />Amy.wiggins@eglin.af.mil</p>
<p>Respondents are required to submit an electronic copy of the white paper proposal to the Government Contracting Officer, identified above by&nbsp;<strong>18 February 2009.</strong></p>
<p>The white paper proposal will be formatted as follows:<br />Section A: Title, Name of Company (on cover page);<br />Section B: Task Objective (Ref this BAA) (on cover page); and <br />Section C: Technical Approach, as follows:</p>
<p>1. A reasonably complete discussion stating the background and objectives of the proposed study and design work, the tools, techniques, and approaches to be considered, and the resources to be employed. The description must provide a complete understanding of how the objectives and guidance of Section B will be addressed. Include the nature and extent of the anticipated risks and results (basic design concept), including further testing needed.</p>
<p>2. The type of support, if any, the respondent requests of the 808ARSG/687ARSS, e.g. information, facilities, equipment, and materials.</p>
<p>3. The identity of facilities, specialized equipments, or other real property to be used for the work, if appropriate, for an understanding of the technical work to be conducted.</p>
<p>Section D: Respondent's capabilities and related experience (to include past and present performance) as a system developer/integrator, techniques, or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the described objectives. Of particular interest is relevant ADS experience, and intellectual capital/expertise.</p>
<p>Section E: Price of study (not counted in 10 page limit)</p>
<p>Section F: Related efforts (not counted in 10 page limit). Provide an explanation of all related Government on-going and completed contracts or assistance instruments; a technical point of contact and telephone number for each contract cited. In addition, the names of federal, state, local agencies, or other parties receiving the proposals and/or funding the proposed effort of a similar nature. Negative response required.</p>
<p>White paper proposals are to be submitted electronically in Microsoft Word 2000, XP, or compatible format. All white paper proposals shall be single spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch (10 point). Each white paper proposal submitted should be limited to 10 pages (excluding cover page). A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11-inch piece of paper. Respondents shall provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission. White papers will be evaluated using the criteria set forth in this BAA.</p>
<p>The cost of preparing white paper proposals in response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.</p>
<p>More than one white paper proposal may be submitted by each respondent, if the respondent feels they can adequately address each topic listed in the Statement of Objectives. There is no desire to constrain innovation beyond reason; however, for practical reasons, the respondent should measure its response.</p>
<p>If the respondent wishes to restrict distribution of its white paper proposal, it must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b). If information contained in the white paper proposal is in the public domain or cannot be protected under law as a trade secret (e.g., a patent application), the Air Force will not accept liability for failure to safeguard against open disclosure. Refer to FAR 15.609(a) and (b). The respondent, whose white paper proposal contains limited or no limited rights data, is required to so state in order that misunderstandings may be avoided.</p>
<p>While the anticipated contract type for this award is Firm Fixed Price, the Government reserves the right to award other contract types or assistance instruments in lieu of contracts, which may require awardees to have an approved accounting system.</p>
<p>The general scope for a contract resulting from this BAA is a limited research program, generally a feasibility study. The program should be designed to demonstrate well defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not require a substantial testing effort to provide assurance of results. Nonetheless, any testing that will be required should be identified and described.</p>
<p>Statement of Objectives</p>
<p>The objectives of this BAA are to evaluate risk, evaluate technology maturity, and to stimulate industry interest to eventually foster competition for acquisition of MADS. This BAA helps the Air Force meet objectives to that end, specifically:</p>
<p>1. Create an alternative design concept to reduce volume and weight of one Key System below that shows high confidence of being integrated with current ADS technology to create a MADS:</p>
<p>a. Prime Power (to include Power Generation, Power Conditioning, and Power Storage)<br />b. Thermal Management<br />c. High Efficiency Source<br />d. Alternative Antenna Concepts</p>
<p>2. Characterize the maturity of proposed component technologies.</p>
<p>3. Identify projected reliability and maintainability of proposed approach.</p>
<p>687 ARSS anticipates awarding multiple study contracts based upon selection of white paper proposal responses. Respondents shall prepare white paper proposals that address the objectives stated above. The information below is provided for guidance and represents the type of information to be presented in the Final Technical Report resulting from any contract award (it is not anticipated that respondents will provide complete detailed information mentioned below in the white paper proposal itself):</p>
<p>&bull; Assume that specified repel effects remain unchanged from the objectives/requirements of the Draft Capabilities Description Document (CDD).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Use, identify, and explain a convincing mix of analyses, simulations, and empirical data to support your recommended alternatives with respect to the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>o Define and identify commercial and military off-the-shelf (COTS/MOTS) hardware and software</p>
<p>o Identify the following subcomponent information:</p>
<p>&#61607; Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of proposed subcomponents<br />&#61607; How many of each subcomponent have been produced and used<br />&#61607; Frequency of maintenance and any specialized maintenance equipment that is specified by the manufacture of the subcomponents <br />&#61607; Any proprietary or exclusive agreements with any manufacture of the subcomponents<br />&#61607; Special logistical and environmental considerations for any subcomponents (transportability issues, storage issues, or the like)</p>
<p>o Characterize the trade space of volume and weight vs. different design approaches</p>
<p><br />687 ARSS has classified SECRET technical information to support white paper proposal preparation.</p>
<p>An annex containing relevant classified information on the ADS may be provided on an individual basis to contracting companies that furnish the following information: CAGE code, SECRET facility clearance verification, storage capability, and approved safeguarding. After information is submitted it will be verified, approved, and then the classified information will be sent. The available information includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Draft Capabilities Description Document (CDD)<br />&bull; ADS 2 specification<br />&bull;&nbsp;ADS CONOPS<br />&bull; ADS Human effects data<br />&bull; Drawings<br />&bull; Security Classification Guide</p>
<p>(The MADS Fact sheet has been replaced by the draft CDD)</p>
<p>No data on the MRAP vehicles will be provided by the Government in conjunction with this BAA.</p>
<p>The following data submittal is expected to be required for any contract(s) awarded as a result of white paper proposal selection:</p>
<p>A Mid-Term Technical Presentation must be delivered at the middle of the performance period and a Final Technical Report must be delivered at the end of the performance period. The Mid-Term Technical Presentation must be presented at Eglin AFB to the 687 ARSS and submitted electronically in Microsoft PowerPoint 2007, XP, or compatible format. The Final Technical Report must be submitted electronically in Microsoft Word 2007, XP, or compatible format. 687 ARSS must be given authorization to read and write to the electronic document. This final report, as with the white paper proposal, must address the objectives and guidance set forth in the BAA.</p>
<p>With respect to the Final Technical Report, the Government negotiator will work out an appropriate Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) with each selected respondent, unless a CDRL is not appropriate.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance: will end no later than 15 September 2009 (including final report delivery)</p>
<p>Type of Contract: The anticipated contract type for awards under this BAA will be Firm Fixed Price. The Air Force reserves the right to award other contract types or assistance instruments in lieu of contracts.</p>
<p>Anticipated Number of Awards: The Air Force anticipates making multiple awards based upon the following list:<br />&bull; Prime Power concept and designs approximately $300,000.00 each<br />&bull; Thermal management concept and designs approximately $250,000.00 each<br />&bull; Alternative antenna concept and designs approximately $50,000.00 each<br />&bull; High efficiency gyrotron source concept and designs approximately $50,000.00 each</p>
<p>All anticipated awards are within the limits of available funding, approximately $1.5M.</p>
<p>WHITE PAPER PROPOSAL EVALUATION</p>
<p>White paper proposals will be evaluated using the factors given below.</p>
<p>1. Relevant Experience (Does the respondent appear to be able to perform meaningful work with regard to ADS technologies?) The respondent's capabilities, ADS-related experience (to include past and present work) as a system developer/integrator, systems engineering techniques, or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the described objectives. The intellectual capital/expertise and industrial know-how/capability available will be evaluated.<br />2. Credible Approach (Does the white paper reveal a likelihood of the respondent successfully addressing the study objectives.) An assessment of the proposed analysis, design, and integration approach to include scientific and/or technical merits, and associated risks, will be made.<br />3. Potential Return (Does the approach described appear to offer a path to a smaller lighter Key System?) The credible approach must indicate a system concept that meets the objectives listed in Section B - one that would seem to reasonably overcome development and integration challenges. "Break-through" alternative subcomponents designs or integration concepts, with articulate illuminating descriptions that reduce the perception of risk, will also be considered on balance.</p>
<p>It is the policy of 808 ARSG/687 ARSS to treat all white paper proposals as privileged information prior to award, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;An Ombudsman has been appointed to address the concerns of offerors or potential offerors.&nbsp; The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Manager or Contracting Officer, but communicates Contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.&nbsp; When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.&nbsp; The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.&nbsp; Matters of routine or administrative nautre concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified below.&nbsp; The Ombudsman is Colonel Arnold W. Bunch, AAC/CV, at 101 West D Ave, Suite 116, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5495; his phone number is (850) 882-5422.&nbsp; Collect calls will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The Market Survey is updated to delete the principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort from 541990 All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, size standard $7,000,000 to the following:
1) 541310 Architectural Services, Size Standard $4,500,0002) 541330 Engineering Services, Size Standard $4,500,000
The above Name (Mary Dobbs) is not the Market Survey Point of Contact.  The Market Survey Point of Contact is Audrey Lucas at (202) 385-8364.
This market survey provides clarification and is in addition to the previously posted FAA En Route Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs) Modernization Program - Architecture and Engineering Services posted on FAA Contract Opportunities on June 6, 2008 (Post ID 6759).  
This is a market survey for the FAA's En Route ARTCC Modernization Program - Architecture and Engineering Services.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

<DESC>I.	Introduction:

The USAID/Guyana Mission is responsible for implementing the U.S Government’s Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) two-year, $6.7 million Threshold Country Program (TCP). The primary objective of the TCP is to improve Guyana’s performance on the MCC’s Fiscal Policy indicator which it fails.  Specifically, the TCP is designed to help the Government of Guyana reduce its large fiscal deficit by improving tax administration, improving budget management and controlling expenditures, educating taxpayers, and strengthening parliamentary oversight.  Moreover, as Guyana also fails MCC’s business indicator, the grant will help reduce the number of days and costs associated with starting a business by modernizing and streamlining customs administration and the business registration process. Guyana is plagued with weak public institutions, lack of transparency, high migration rates, poor infrastructure and an economy that needs greater diversification based on private sector investment. . An improved fiscal and business environment should have a positive impact on Guyana’s economic development. 
 
The fiscal deficit problem is of relatively recent origin. In 1999 the deficit was 1.7 percent of GDP. However, from 1999 to 2005 the deficit rose from less than 2 percent to 13.6 percent of GDP. Since then the deficit has begun to decline with the successful implementation of the VAT and increased fiscal discipline. However, Guyana was hit hard by oil and food price increases in the first half of 2008 and the government’s response – increased public sector wages and temporary tax relief on some staples -- has led to slippages.  Additional fiscal pressures on the budget remain due to spending associated with public sector restructuring, particularly the need to continue restructuring and modernization of the sugar industry.  

Implementation of the TCP began in January 2008 and the program is currently set to run until end-February 2008. While good progress has been made laying the foundation for success in meeting the benchmarks, the capacity of the government counterparts remains a constraint. Achievement of the results will require a strong effort by the government supported by timely and appropriate interventions by the institutional contractor aided by active mission management.     


II.           Basic function of the position:

The United States Agency for International Development Mission to Guyana (USAID/Guyana) requires an experienced Senior Economist to manage the implementation of fiscal and business reforms under Guyana’s MCC Threshold Country Plan (TCP). The proposed incumbent must have senior-level technical expertise and practical knowledge and work experience in program management, acquisition and assistance planning, program design, and monitoring and evaluation.  The incumbent must be able to think and operate strategically and programmatically, analyzing complex situations in order to assist in the development of activities under the TCP and also provide a full range of consultative, advisory, information-gathering, analytical, and evaluative technical services of broad scope and complexity.  The Advisor will be responsible for ensuring that the design and implementation of all TCP activities are fully coordinated with the institutional contractor, key Government of Guyana agencies – the Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA), the Finance Ministry (MOF), the Customs Administration, the Parliament, the Guyana Investment Agency, the Deeds Registry-- MCC and other USG agencies, international organizations and donors active in these areas. 

In accordance with the USAID/Guyana procurement plan, technical support will be required for a total of eighteen months.   All work products will be required within this timeframe. The PSC must begin his/her assignment on or about April 2009  in Georgetown, Guyana.  A five-day work week will be authorized.


III.	         Major duties and responsibilities

A.	Economic and Donor Coordination Leadership: In coordination with the USAID, MCC, implementing partners, the IMF, the IDB and other donors, the Senior Economic Advisor will provide substantive technical leadership on all aspects of the TCP, with a view to achieving the set targets. Specifically, the incumbent will:

1.	Engage senior GoG officials from the GRA, MOF, Goinvest, Parliamentary Office, the Deeds Registry, implementing partners, and other donors in high-level policy dialogue and discussions on issues related to TCP implementation.

2.	Work closely with other donors, in particular, the IDB and IMF to contribute to enhancing the coordination of donor activities, while seeking to ensure that other donor resources complement TCP resources to the maximum extent possible. 

3.	Regularly brief the USAID Mission and Embassy staff on the status of implementation of the TCP. 

4. Review and analyze current fiscal trends in Guyana and the key policy and operational constraints that Guyana would need to overcome to achieve the desired results. Provide interpretations of such relevant data and recommend appropriate strategies in line with the data.


B.	Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO):  The TCP Senior Economist will be required to perform as  CTO  for the TC and work with EG Team Leader. As such, the incumbent’s responsibilities will include:  

1.	Regularly meet with the EG Team Leader and  provide oversight of the contractor’s performance focusing on the actions and activities of the chief of party and key personnel in Guyana as well as approval of all short-term experts and advisors, their workplans and outputs.  

2.	With the EG Team Leader, monitor the contractor's performance and verify that it conforms to the technical requirements and quality standards agreed to in the terms and conditions of the contract. Accordingly, approval of implementation plans, work plans, or monitoring or evaluation plans must be consistent with the terms and conditions of the contract. The CTO must document any material deficiencies in the contractor's performance, with significant input from the Economic Growth Team Leader, and bring them to the immediate attention of the Regional Contracting Officer (RCO), the USAID Mission Director and the MCC.

3.

The CPR must be prepared in accordance with the performance evaluation requirements in USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR, 48 CFR Chapter 7) subpart 742.15 ("Contractor Performance Information") and the Automated Directives System (ADS) Chapter 302 ("USAID Direct Contracting"), in the section entitled "Evaluation of Contractor Performance."

Tasks potentially involve:

1.	Designing and refining activity performance monitoring systems including the design, implementation, and analysis of baseline surveys, rapid reconnaissance surveys, tracer studies, opinion polls and other social/economic assessment methodologies as appropriate.

2.	Developing a computerized database management system to track and analyze the impact of the TCP’s program’s activities.

3.	 Developing and/or maintaining a performance monitoring system that includes performance indicators and baselines, and providing advice on the modification of strategy, targets, measurements or activities based on analyses of progress.

Hancock, 817-886-1077; or by e-mail at David.l.Hancock@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR>FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presence Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:  <BR><BR>Advanced Individual Training (AIT), Basic Training (BT) Barracks and Warrior in Transition (WIT) Barracks, or other similar facilities:  <BR><BR>Advanced Individual Training Complexes:<BR>AIT complexes are comprised of multiple facilities, consisting of Barracks/Company Operations Facilities (BCOF), Dining Facilities (DFAC), Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ), Support Facilities, and Outdoor Areas.

The Government will evaluate the proposals, in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering past performance, technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <BR><BR>The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Volume I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach;  Volume II - DESIGN TECHNICAL: Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design, and Sustainability.  Volume III - REMAINING PERFORMANCE CAPABILITY AND SMALL BUSINESS UTILIZATION:  Remaining Performance Capability; Proposed Task Order Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price.  <BR><BR>Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 30 Jan 2009 under solicitation number W9126G-09-R-0013.

In the event that one or more of the contracts proposed for award cannot be made, the Government may award contracts with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.   If only one of the proposed contracts under this MATOC can be made, the Government reserves the right to award a SATOC with a reduced capacity and re-advertise the remaining capacity under a full and open solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award only the initial task as a c-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experience for a contract of this magnitude.  The remaining capacity would then be advertised as a full and open competition.  Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance. The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation.   Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type.  Once the contracts under this solicitation are awarded and there is duplicative coverage for this facility type in the same region, any requirement less than $15 million will be evaluated first for advertisement under any set-aside contract or pool of contracts prior.  The Government will consider the current workload under the set-aside contract, performance on previous task orders, and the small business firms ability to obtain additional boding prior to making a determination.  <BR><BR>The total estimated contract capacity is $420,000,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  The minimum guarantee will be $ 5,000.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.  The minimum task order limitation is $15,000,000.  The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $100,000,000.  The maximum combination of orders is $100,000,000.

<DESC>Request for InformationSolicitation:  M00264-09-R-0002
Subject:  U.S. Marine Corps Fire and Emergency Services, Enterprise Records Management Reporting System.
Question 1.  What is the time for submission?
Answer 1.  Close of Business on Friday, January 23, 2009.
Question 2.  Do contractors have access to the USMC website as indicated in the RFI?
Answer 2.  The HQMC (C4) site has been changed to require CAC log on.Thus, none of the companies will be able to access the site to review thedocumentation we were pointing them towards.  We will have to provide therequired documentation as part of the RFP process.  
Question 3.  Is there a parallel civilian criteria that needs to be met for system requirements regarding the certifications and accreditations?  
Answer 3.  The USMC F&ES Program is unaware of parallel civilian criteria.  For the purposes of this RFI, a response indicating that your company will meet the DoD/DIACAP requirements will suffice.
Question 4.  Will we be able to receive further details or speak with an IT person who understands technical requirements for the RM piece?
Answer 4.  (1) The United States Marine Corps (USMC) Fire Protection and Emergency Services program records management requirements are derived from the requirements of the following policy documents, which should be available in the public domain (a simple internet search should retrieve the documents):
?	Department of Defense Instructions (DoDI) 6055.06 dated 21 December 2006 "DoD Fire and Emergency Services Program".?	Marine Corps Order (MCO) P11000.11B dated 9 January 1997 "Fire Protection and Emergency Services".
A full list of the technical requirements for records management functionality has not been prepared by the USMC F&ES program office yet, but will be developed during the later stages of this procurement process.  Generally speaking, the program is attempting to meet the basic records management requirements of any fire and emergency services department, including but not limited to: personnel training records, fire apparatus fleet inventory and other vehicle information, equipment inventory, budget data, etc.
(2) Department of Defense, Department of Navy (DoN), and the United States Marine Corps publish policy regarding Records Management, which address requirements such as:  how long records must be maintained, information assurance for records, privacy act data collection requirements, etc.  The future Request for Proposals (RFP) associated with this effort will include a listing of applicable Records Management policy documents.  The below list is provided as sample of policy documents that could potentially affect the E-RMRS system procurement.

<DESC>Questions in response to the Request for Information, LFF Strategic Energy Plan for Camp Lejeune
Question 1.  Did a contractor or vendor fulfill the same or similar work before?  
Answer 1.No, this is a new effort.

Question 2.  Are there preexisting contracts that provide the same or similar work?  If there are, please provide:  Contractor, contract number, contract value and expiration date.  
Answer 2. No, this is a new effort that we have not had done before.
Question 3.  Please clarify whether this initial SON covers two or three installations.   Specifically, the SON notes three:  Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Marine Corps Air Station New River, and Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point.  The synopsis did not include Marine Corps Air Station New River. 
Answer 3. All three installations are included. MCAS New River is adjacent to MCB Camp Lejeune and was left off initially, though the intent is for the plan to address all three installations Question 4.  Please clarify what are the envisioned requirements of a "smart grid"?  Within the industry the term "smart grid" can cover a large number of capabilities.  It would be beneficial to responders if the USMC would elaborate on what their vision of a smart grid is. 
Answer 4. We don't have a specific vision for how Smart Grid might be applied to our bases or what capabilities may come from this. We are open to learning about capabilities that can be advantageous for us to use and so do not want to narrow the potential effort.
Question 5. Sub Task 1a and  1b used the term "dramatically reduce energy consumption".  This is a very broad term and it would be beneficial to responders if the Navy would elaborate on what they envision as "dramatically reduce".   In the case where installations have implemented an aggressive energy program and already experience 20% reduction, a 5% reduction might be considered a "dramatic reduction".  On the other hand an installation which was just implementing an aggressive program could experience a 20% reduction.
Answer 5. We expect that through a thorough review of the energy/utility landscape in the region around our bases, emerging technologies, and innovative business models that we will be able to meet and exceed legal mandates to increase the energy efficiency of our facilities, reduce fossil fuel dependence and increase our use of renewable energy. This means going beyond the obvious "first order" actions, which are important, but don't necessarily, as you point out, get us to our goals. The expected result of the plan is to let us know where we should apply our resources and efforts to achieve this.

<a href="mailto:sherita.crosby@va.gov">Amendment 1 Cardiac Cath</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to modify the clause at C.2 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items (JAN 1999) as detailed below and to extend the solicitation response date to January 28, 2009.1.  The clause at C.2 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items (JAN 1999)is hereby modified by deleting the text starting on page 23 under 'Pricing' and by replacing the deleted text (below) with replacement text below) as follows:  a.  Solicitation Page 23, under Pricing, Delete the following text:"The offeror will be evaluated based on the relationship of their proposed sum total of CPT codes represented from Line Items 0001 through Line Items 0017 (Base Year only) relative to the sum total of per procedure payments calculated using Medicare Part B's rate of reimbursement for the malpractice component and the practice expense (facility*) components only.  The Medicare Part B rate of reimbursement for the work component will not be included in the calculation, as VA physicians will be performing as the attending Physician.   The Chart below depicts how the Offerors Proposed Price will be evaluated relative to the Medicare per procedure Benchmark: 100% equals = 0% deviation from the sum total of per procedure payments calculated using Medicare Part B's rate of reimbursement for the malpractice component and the practice expense (facility*) components only.   80% equals = 20% deviation, 60% equals = 40% deviation etc.The following depicts an example of the calculation format for Medicare Part B components (less the RVU attributable to the Work component) and Medicare rate calculation to be used as a benchmark for evaluating the Offeror's proposed price:Per Procedure:  CPT code Relative Value Unit (RVU) components ((Practice Expense Facility) + (Malpractice Expense)) for each CPT per procedure code identified in Section B  Schedule of Services Costs/ Prices.    For Example:  				  	  	  	Medicare Payment Code	Description	  	Non Facility*	Facility**	Intracardiac catheter ablation of arrhythmogenic focus; for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia by ablation of fast or slow atrioventricular pathways, accessory atrioventricular connections or other atrial foci, singly or in combination							93651			$326.024**Facility: Includes hospitals (inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department), ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs), and skilled nursing facilities (SNFs).*Non-Facility: Includes all other settings.Physician Component	Practice Expense Component	Malpractice Component	Total RVU	CY 2008 Conversion Factor of 	BenchmarkMedicare PaymentRVU + GPCI	RVU + GPCI	RVU + GPCI			Work	Facility	Insurance	Facility**		0	7.43	1.13	8.56	$38.0870	$326.024The figures presented above are based on 2008 CPT codes and Medicare payment information, excluding the Work RVU component: Medicare Relative Value Payment Amount The payment amount for each service paid under the physician fee schedule is the product of three factors: (1) a nationally uniform relative value for the service (2) a geographic adjustment factor for each physician fee schedule area; and (3) a nationally uniform conversion factor for the service. The conversion factor converts the relative values into payment amounts. For each physician fee schedule service, there are three relative values (1) an RVU for physician work; (2) an RVU for practice expenses; and (3) an RVU for malpractice expense. For each of these components of the fee schedule, there is a geographic practice cost index (GPCI) for each fee schedule area. The GPCIs reflect the relative costs of practice expenses, malpractice insurance, and physician work in an area compared to the national average for each component. The general formula for calculating the Medicare relative value payment amount for a given service in a given fee schedule area can be expressed as: Payment=[(RVU work x GPCI work) + (RVU practice expense x GPCI practice expense) + (RVU malpractice x GPCI malpractice)] x Conversion Factor The Conversion Factor for calendar year (CY) 2008 is $38.0870."b.  Replace the aforementioned deleted text found on Page 23, under Pricing, with the following replacement text:"This factor indicates what each offeror's proposal will cost the Government if selected.  The offeror proposing the lowest total price in Section B will be awarded the maximum points available for price evaluation purposes.  All other offerors will receive a percentage of the points available for evaluation based on the relationship of their total price to the lowest total price.Though the offeror's are not required to submit detailed cost and pricing information with their initial offer, in order to adequately evaluate offers, it may be necessary for the Government to request a breakdown of cost components that make up the offeror's proposed price.  The costs components will include:  Direct Labor, Direct supply cost, General and administrative costs, and Profit.  If it becomes necessary for offerors to provide cost and pricing information, offerors shall be required to define each direct cost component and allocation methods used for indirect costs."2.  All other provisions, terms, and conditions of the above referenced solicitation remains unchaged.
