Prospective offerors are required to meet salient features of Four Channel of High Definition Serial Digital Interface (HDSDI) graphics overlay hardware and software in accordance with the Equipment Specifications and Statement of Work, in addition to any other attachments (if applicable) that will be identified in the solicitation. A firm-fixed price, Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable contract is to be awarded from this requirement. This is Full and Open Competition. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334310 with business size standard of 750 employees. This will be a 100% small business set-aside. <br /><br />We need to have four separate, independent HDSDI inputs into the video graphics system. On top of each of these video signals, we must be able to overlay four different sets of alpha/numeric values. These overlay signals must be separate and independent from each other. These overlay values will be changing in real time and must update on the video screen in real time.<br /><br /><br />Example: Video one is a side view of the tunnel. We want to display Mach Number in the upper right corner of the video screen. The mach number is changing as we run, therefore the value displayed on the video screen must change accordingly. Video two is a top view of the model. We want to display Total Temperature in the lower center of the video screen and Total Pressure next to that. Total Temperature and Total Pressure are changing as we run, therefore the values displayed on the video screen must change accordingly. All three of the parameters will be sent to the overlay system together. The software will be programmed to send to Mach Number to one channel and the Temp and Pressure to another channel. <br />

<DESC>Solicitation Announcement: W15QKN-11-R-F014
The U.S Army Contracting Command - Picatinny, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of PM Soldier Weapons, intends to solicit, negotiate and award a sole source contract with General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products (GDATP) under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A) to order the required initial spare parts and gages needed to satisfy the proprietary requirements of W15QKN-09-C-0060.  This contract is planned to be initiated in third quarter Fiscal Year (FY) 2011.  Throughout the entire contract performance, GDATP is the sole contractor possessing the ability to deliver these spare parts and gages to meet the requirements of contract W15QKN-09-C-0060 without introducing significant cost, schedule, technical, and safety risk to the program.  GDATPs Quick Change Barrel (QBC) kit is a proprietary design; no other contractor could provide spare parts and gages without obtaining GDATPs proprietary data.  Acquiring spares from a source other than GDATP will not allow the capability to meet the system performance requirements and component spare parts and gages demand by the end of 3QFY11.  Only a sole source acquisition to GDATP will meet the initial spare parts and gages delivery schedules required by 3QFY11.  Any other type of acquisition will result in unacceptable delays and deliveries well beyond 3QFY11.  Please note this notice does not constitute as a Request For Proposal (RFP).  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The anticipated award date for this action is June 2011.

<DESC>2011-N-13336 Applied Biosystems Maintenance Agreement
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price maintenance agreement contract to Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, CA 94404. The contract will be for a base year of 12 months with 4 option years of 12 months each.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c) (1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.</p>
<p>Applied Biosystems is the original equipment manufacturer of these instruments that are needed to be maintained. The Division of Laboratory Sciences/Newborn Screening Molecular Biology Branch utilizes a variety of instruments from Applied Biosystems to accomplish its public health mission. These pieces of equipment are essential in the performance of mission critical research projects for laboratory work and analyses performed by the Division of Laboratory Sciences As such, they are in continuous use and must be maintained appropriately.</p>
<p>As the original equipment manufacturer of these instruments, Applied Biosystems is the only contractor that can fulfill these requirements. The maintenance includes preventative maintenance services, replacement parts certified to manufacturer's specification and emergency on-site support in the event the instruments fail to work properly. Applied Biosystems provides service manuals to engineers containing up to date service procedures applicable to the equipment. Engineers periodically receive service and manufacturer's information, often consisting of compilations of recent problems and suggested methods of correction actions.</p>
<p>While there are other independent companies that can service this equipment in question, those companies will always have to contact Applied Biosystems for technical/software updates and factory certified replacement components. Such an arrangement could significantly slow down the process of keeping equipment maintained and repaired that are involved in mission critical experiments and research. The service engineers are highly experienced with the equipment, factory trained and certified for repairs and maintenance of Applied Biosystems instruments. They also maintained an on-site inventory of replacement parts and equipment so that in the case of instrument failures repair and service requests require the least amount of time possible. Applied Biosystems Inc has proven to be knowledgeable, reliable, and efficient regarding installation, repair, and maintenance of their instruments.<br /><br />No solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to Applied Biosystems. CDC believes that Applied Biosystems is the only source available to provide this service that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Mr. Thaddeus Rollins via email to <a href="mailto:tnr6@cdc.gov">tnr6@cdc.gov</a> using solicitation number 2011-N-13336 in the subject line, no later than 11:59 pm Eastern Time, 21 April 2011.</p>

The NAICS code for this procurement is 423490, Other Professional Equipment and Supplies Merchant Wholesalers.<br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is for Gerstel Inc. to provide a robotic system that is used for injecting aliquots for the measurement of compounds in NHANES samples for the trans fatty acid project. Usage of this instrumentation will increase throughput for our laboratory by greater than 100% to assess the U.S. population for the following trans fatty acids: 9-trans hexadecenoic acid (palmitelaidic acid, C16:1 19), 9-trans-octadecenoic acid (eladidic acid C18:1 19), 11-trans-octadecenoic acid (vaccenic acid , C18:1 111), 9-trans-12 trans-octadecadienoic acid (Linolelaidate acid, C18:2 19, 112). Furthermore, using instruments from the same manufacturer would greatly reduce the time necessary to modify a method on a different type of instrument. This would include additional training, method development, and method characterization which could take 1-4 months in revalidating the methods, reprograming software and continuity in instrument sensitivity.<br /><br />Gerstel Inc is the only responsible source capable of meeting all of the Government's requirement because no other vendor could provide this customized autosampling system for the existing GS/MSD system. Gerstel is the only source capable of providing the same specifications, service, warranty service, maintenance and ease of use.<br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the Gerstel Inc.. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2011-94071 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN March 10, 2011 <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />

<DESC>R.Q.M. No: 2024992<br />Solicitation Number: NHLBI-CSB-{HL}-2011-129-DDC <br />Solicitation Type: Sole Source (Non Competitive)<br />Suggested Source: QuantaMetrics <br />Title: 66:Instrument and Laboratory equipment <br />NAICS: 334516/500
<p><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br />The COAC Services Branch, Office of Acquisitions, DERA, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH, for the Molecular Machines Section (MMS), Laboratory of Cell and Tissue Morphodynamics (LCTM), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to QuantaMetrics, 2865 South Eagle R, Newtown, PA 18940, for the purchase of VisiTech Confocal System as outlined below.</p>
<p>The reference number: NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2011-129-DDC. .</p>
<p>The Government requires the purchase of a laser-based spinning disk confocal system from Quantametrics which will enable the Government to pursue research. The mission of the Molecular Machines Section is to understand the underlying cell biological causes of human ciliopathies, aneuploidy and defective stem cell division. The approach is highly multidisciplinary that includes molecular genetics, mammalian and insect cell culture, the animal model system Drosophila, biochemistry, and functional genomics. Specific area of research include cell polarity and the asymmetric division of stem cells, all aspects of centrosome biogenesis in both differentiated cells and stem cells, various pathways of mitotic spindle assembly, the regulation of mitotic spindle alignment, cell motility, and tissue morphogenesis during development. Finally, in addition to investigating the role of known players in each of these areas, the goal is to also identify novel players using in vivo and in vitro genetic screens. .</p>
<p>Part # QLC-100, VisiTech Confocal System consisting of the following; Yokogawa CSU-22 confocal scan head with Yokogawa patented dual nipkow scanning spinning disk technology with capture rates of up to 360 fps. Multi laser MM for up to 6 SS Lasers, AOTF &amp; FDS, 488nm/50mW Solid State Laser, 561nmW Solid State Laser and 642nm/50mW Solid State Laser, 6-Position Emission Filter Wheel. Meta-Morph Workstation with 27' monitor and Meta-Morph 7.7 premier. VTI USB driver, to include delivery and installation <br /><br />The sole source determination is based on the fact the major method used by the Molecular Machines Section is high-resolution live single-cell and whole-tissue imaging. These experiments require highly complex microscope setups that allow for the precise control of both the macro- and micro-environments. All the components listed in the above description are required for the proper operation of the existing Nikon Ti-E microscope. They include a laser housing unit with three steady-state lasers, a modified Spinning Disk confocal head (CSU-10) and the workstation needed to properly run this system. The Government has determined, by an exhaustive and diligent search, that this exact system as configured can only be offered by Quantametrics, which is the sole licensed US distributor for Visitech International, the manufacturer of this instrument</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), 50 South Drive, Building 50-Room 2523, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.</p>
<p>The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with size standard of 500 employees; the small business set-aside does apply to this requirement.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition <br />procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-48 (January 31, 2011).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by April 13, 2011, 7:30 am Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2011-129-DDC, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Deborah Coulter.

The requirement is for an upgrade to the Optimized Top Owl (OTO) Helmet Mounted Sight Display (HMSD) System Operational Flight Program (OFP) and system interface for the UH-1Y and AH-1Z System Configuration Set (SCS) 7.0.  This development will include OTO HMSD preliminary and  final software builds.  The delivery date will be June 2012.


The Thales' HMSD system was qualified on the 
UH-1Y and AH-1Z airframe as part of the platform's state-of-the-art weapon acquisition and engagement system under the H-1 Upgrades Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD).
   During EMD, the aircraft's avionics suite was designed to incorporate and accommodate the Thales helmet system.  Following EMD the UH-1Y and AH-1Z platforms are undergoing continuous improvements in an overlapping  Spiral Upgrade Program which includes upgrades to the HMSD.  Thales is currently developing software to incorporate SCS 6.0 upgrades  and they are the only source who can execute the SCS 7.0 upgrades and thereby maintain compatibility with SCS 6.0 implementation.


This requirement will be procured in accordance with the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2), in that Thales Avionics is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the OTO Helmet.
  Thales Avionics is the only known company with the knowledge and capability to provide the required development and updates for this system. See Notes 22 and 26.


All responsible sources believing that they can provide the required service may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation clearly showing their ability to perform the work without compromising the quality, accuracy, reliability and delivery of the product which shall be considered by the agency.  All submissions must reference BOA N00019-10-G-0001 GM02 and be received at the contracting office no later than 06 May 2011.  Please submit responses to Rowena Geyer by email to rowena.geyer@navy.mil, or by mail to Commander Code 254100D, NAVAIR WD, 429 East Bowen Road, Mail Stop 4015, China Lake, CA  93555-6108.
 Award of this order is expected to be on or about October 2011.


Note 22 - The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days  if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.


Note 26 - Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking sources for Advanced Technology (AT) X-ray systems for screening passenger carry-on baggage to be used in our Nations airports.  The TSA will examine each offerors response to this announcement to determine those vendors who have satisfactorily met the minimum requirements as specified in the white paper requirements section of this announcement.  The TSA will then establish a Qualified Product List (QPL) based on the overall performance of each offerors AT against TSA specifications and reasonableness of price.  Only offerors that respond to this announcement and who demonstrate that they can fulfill TSAs requirements will be eligible for placement onto the QPL.  This will be an Open Qualified Products List.  Vendors will be able to submit white papers to the contracting officer at any time, although testing will only occur on a periodic basis.  If the product fails to meet the basic criteria or fails during the Qualification Data Package (QDP) submittal or certification testing, a vendor will not be permitted to retest sooner than 30 days after the failure, unless it is determined to be in the best interest of the government.  If the product fails a second time the product will be locked out of future testing for six months after the second failure, unless the government determines it is in TSAs best interest to allow further testing.  Only offerors who successfully complete testing will be placed on the QPL and be considered for a contract award.  (see attachments for entire announcement)

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is soliciting Small Business contractors for a construction project for Bulkhead Repairs, Block Island Harbor of Refuge, Rhode Island. <br><br>The work of this project consists of repairing an existing steel sheet pile bulkhead and timber wharf at the Block Island HOR (locally known as "Old Harbor"), Rhode Island. The existing T and are both approximately 250 in lengths. The existing steel bulkhead is to be abandoned in place and a new steel sheet pile bulkhead is to be installed behind it. The stone revetment fronting the existing bulkhead will also be repaired, requiring new stone to supplement the material already existing in the revetment. Also, the deck and framing of the existing timber wharf in front of the bulkhead will be removed and replaced. Existing timber piles are in good condition and will be reused. Due to the proximity of adjacent buildings, it is anticipated that much of the work will be performed from floating platform or jack barge. However, land equipment will be required for excavation and movement of materials. It should also be noted that space for staging of equipment and materials on site is extremely limited. Transport of materials and equipment to the island via the Block Island Ferry is limited and therefore the contractor may need to make other arrangements to bring materials and equipment to the project site. <br><br>This solicitation will be available on or about April 21, 2011 and will be available for downloading by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov). In order to view this solicitation, prospective contractors are required to self register their firm with Federal Business Opportunities (Go to http://www.fbo.gov and register now under Vendor/Citizens). Amendments, if any, to this solicitation will be made available at the https://www.fbo.gov Internet site. Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests will be accepted. Registrants are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the registration list. This procurement is set aside for Small Business firms. The applicable NAICS code is 237990 with a Small Business Size Standard of $33,500,000. The estimated cost of the contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. All responsible sources may submit a bid, which will be considered by the New England District. <br><br>

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), PG-13 Infantry Weapons Systems (IWS), PMM-131, Program Manager Reconnaissance and Amphibious Raids (PM RAR) intends to issue a full and open competitive solicitation for a five (5) year Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) Contract composed of a base year and four (4) out years.  MCSC will award to the lowest priced technically acceptable small business.  The award will include a minimum of three (3) hours per year and a maximum of twelve (12) hours per year for vertical wind tunnel flying hours.  The total estimated award value is anticipated to be $53,875.64.

The PM RAR  manages the procurement, delivery, operation and maintenance of all Military Free-Fall testing and training requirements.
  In order to safely meet the MCSC requirements, PM RAR has a need to establish a contract for wind tunnel flying hours to support mission requirements to develop, demonstrate, procure, field, and provide life-cycle management for Airborne/Parachuting and associated equipment for the Marine Operating Forces (MARFORs).  To this end, a requirement exists for a capability to evaluate parachute systems and accessories.  The ability to conduct simulated free-fall in a controlled environment provides an increased level of safety for our evaluators.  Parachute systems and components expected for evaluation include items such as parachute packs, parachutists helmets, navigation tools, and weapons slings/pouches.
  Parachutists also require maintaining proficiency in parachuting procedures and techniques.  

Wind tunnels are vertical rooms or buildings that generate wind and re-circulate air flow to simulate freefalling during parachute operations.  Availability of a wind tunnel will provide a means to attain this training when mission aircraft are not available, increasing the flexibility for scheduling training.

<a href="mailto:charlene.buduo@us.army.mil">CECOM Contracting Center,Washington (CECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC><br>The US Army Contracting Command - APG on behalf of the US Army RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) Science and Technology Division (STD) is conducting research to identify state-of-the-art hyperspectral imaging technology, within industry and academia, for standoff trace detection of explosive materials and associated chemical species. Specifically, NVESD seeks mature technological approaches that can transition quickly from design through 9-month fabrication, test, and deployment in a 12-month overall period. The overall goal of this technology is to provide automated day/night/all-weather substance detection capability from a vehicle borne mast mounted platform, operable from stand-still at standoff ranges from 3 to 100m, and operable from 0kph to 20kph advancement speeds at stand-off ranges from 3m to 30m, with a 1m to 18m Field of Regard. As such, any turnkey material solution should package all of its instruments in a stabilized gimbal for sensor isolation and 2-axis pointing. To address a real-world CONOPS scenario, the system architecture should accommodate all data processing onboard the host vehicle using a dedicated workstation as well as a radio transmission link for streaming data to a remote processing and analysis station. This remote processing and analysis station should be included in the design as part of the total system solution. To be a viable approach, design consideration must be given to target/scene situational awareness (i.e. supplemental imagining sensors), accurate geolocation of the detection point (+/- 2cm), and 24-hour image/meta data recording.  Respondents are asked to submit a white paper, no greater than 10 pages in length, describing a realistic and mature hyperspectral-based system approach to stand-off trace detection. Papers shall also include point(s) of contact (email and phone numbers) for further Government inquiry should more information be desired, name and address of firm, Central Contractor Registration CAGE Code and current level of firm's facility clearance (Secret, Top Secret or No Clearance). This is NOT a request for proposal and does not constitute any obligation by the Government to award a contract based on the findings from this survey. The Government will not reimburse interested sources or respondents to this notice, or any follow-on notice, for any costs incurred in association with this announcement, or for subsequent exchanges of information. Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately. The Government will not be responsible for any proprietary information not clearly marked.  All submitted information will be kept by the Government. White papers shall be submitted electronically to Charlene Buduo, Contract Specialist, at charlene.buduo@us.army.mil no later than close of business 6 May 2011.  All questions must be submitted in writing via email to charlene.buduo@us.army.mil, telephonic requests for additional information will not be honored.  The subject of the email message shall be: HYPERSPECTRAL RFI - Your Company's Name.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS: <br><br>This is a Sources Sought Notice (SSN) for planning purposes only, as defined in Federal Acquisition Register (FAR) 15.201e.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code(s) is/are 541711. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method to conduct clinical trials for patients with rising PSA's and nonpalpable biopsy confirmed prostate cancer to support development of an FDA-approved, cost effective, and widely available prostate cancer vaccine to treat both early stages of prostate cancer as well  as recurrent prostate cancer. In accordance with current FDA recommendations for therapeutic cancer vaccines, early clinical trials should: study the safety profile of the vaccine; study the optimal starting dose and dosing schedule for the product; and identify and study the potential biological activities to provide scientific data on which to base further product development.<br><br>BACKGROUND:<br><br>The Department of Defense has the need for improved methodologies for the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer, the most common cancer in US military veterans. Despite current treatment options such as surgery, radiation, and hormone therapy, the disease often comes back (recurrent disease) and can become incurable. Immunotherapy, such as therapeutic vaccines, aims at enhancing the immune response to cancer by directing the immune system to recognize and eliminate tumor cells. The DoD seeks to conduct clinical trials to support the development of a therapeutic vaccine to treat both early stages of prostate cancer as well as recurrent, D3 prostate cancer. This effort seeks to provide improved, cost effective, and widely available treatment options to DoD and Navy populations. <br>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: <br><br>The objective of issuing this SSN is to gather information that will assist in the determination of a suitable contract solution for conducting a clinical trial for patients with rising PSA's and nonpalpable biopsy confirmed prostate cancer.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources forIntensity-Modulated Continuous-Wave Lidar (IM-CW) For Remote Sensing of CO2 and O2 fromSpace.	NASA seeks information from entities which have successfully demonstrated theability to measure CO2 and O2 with an IM-CW lidar in laboratory or field tests.  Also,the technology used to make the measurement should have a clear path to being scaled anddeveloped to successfully meet the goals set forth below within a spaceflight mission. Engineering feasibility to do so should be fully demonstrable within three years.   No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sitesfor the release of any solicitation or synopsis.NASA LaRC is assessing active optical approaches for global measurements of atmosphericCO2 mixing ratios (XCO2) and is interested in determining feasible approaches for makingday/night, all-latitude, all-season CO2 and O2 column measurements from space using anintensity-modulated continuous-wave lidar system.  Three objectives of such measurementsare to (1) quantify global spatial distribution of atmospheric CO2 on scales of weathermodels in the 2019-2024 era, (2) quantify current global spatial distribution ofterrestrial and oceanic sources and sinks of CO2 on 1-degree grids at weekly resolution;and (3) provide a scientific basis for future projections of CO2 sources and sinksthrough data-driven enhancements of Earth-system process modeling.  NASA LaRC hasdemonstrated the feasibility to make atmospheric CO2 column measurements using1.57-micrometer IM-CW lidar on both a test range and from aircraft platforms. Simultaneous laser remote sensing of CO2 and O2 is needed to convert CO2 concentrationsto XCO2 mixing ratios. The mixing ratio needs to be measured to a precision of 0.5percent of background (slightly less than 2 ppm) at 100-km horizontal scales over landand at 200-km scales over open oceans. The objective is to provide full seasonal samplingto high latitudes, day-night sampling, and some ability to resolve (or weight) thealtitude distribution of the CO2-column measurement, particularly across the middle tolower troposphere. CO2 lines are available in the 1.57- and 2.06- micrometer bands, whichminimize the effects of temperature errors. Lines near 1.57 micrometers are identified aspotential candidates because of their relative insensitivity to temperature errors,relative freedom from interfering water-vapor bands, good weighting functions for columnmeasurements across the lower troposphere, and the high technology readiness of lasers.To further reduce residual temperature errors in the CO2 and O2 measurements, aconcurrent passive measurement of temperature along the satellite ground track with anaccuracy of better than 2 degrees K may be required. Atmospheric pressure and densityeffects on deriving the mixing ratio of CO2 columns can be addressed with a combinationof simultaneous CO2 and O2 column density measurements down to the surface or cloud tops. Concurrent active O2 measurements can be based on measurements that use O2 absorptionlines in the 0.76- or 1.27- micrometer band. Such measurements require a polar orbit atan altitude of about 450 km. A lifetime in orbit of at least 3 years is required. Thereare no strict requirements for specific temporal revisit or map revisit times, becausethe data will be assimilated on each pass and the large-scale nature of the surfacesources and sinks will emerge from the geographic gradients of the column integrals. Theimportant coverage is day and night measurements at nearly all latitudes and surfaces toseparate the effects of photosynthesis and respiration. Swath size would be about 200 m.Interested parties should respond with the following information:1.	General Descriptiona.	Physically describe the measurement approach concept providingdiagrams/photographs if available, to include mass and volume. b.	Describe remote sensing system operation (e.g., how the sensor is or would bepackaged and deployed on both aircraft demonstration flights and a spaceflight mission).2.	Flight or Technology Heritage/Qualificationa.	Describe relevant experience to include experience with atmospheric remotesensors and atmospheric measurements described above.b.	Describe the extent to which existing proven technology can be leveraged tominimize technical and schedule risk.c.	Describe any new technologies to be employed on this effort, and anymodifications to existing technology, necessary to meet the measurement requirements. Describe risks associated with incorporating the new or modified technology and how therisks can be minimized.d.	Briefly describe any other issues or considerations that the Government should beaware of for implementation of the atmospheric remote sensor device in this application. e.	Testing  since NASA is seeking sources with demonstrated experience in makingthe measurements described above, please provide information regarding the type andresults of testing which demonstrate that the remote sensor will meet the missionrequirementsf.	Describe whether the device is qualified for flight and if so, describe thequalification program including environments used (e.g., against a MIL spec. or other).Interested organizations having the required specialized capabilities to meet the aboverequirement should submit a capability statement indicating the ability to perform allaspects of the effort described herein.  We request that this capability statement belimited to 15 pages.Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business;average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether theyare large, or any category of small business, number of years in business; affiliateinformation:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, primecontractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customerscovering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers,contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phonenumber).

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.
<p>The purpose of this sources sought notice is to conduct market research to assist in determining whether to set this acquisition aside for small business, 8(a), HUBZone, service-disabled veteran-owned, or woman-owned small business concerns. Any interested small business may submit a capabilities statement demonstrating its ability to perform the requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for Cafeteria Food Services is 722310. The capabilities statement should conform to the instructions provided below.</p>
<p>THE REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), anticipates a requirement for the provision of food services at NIST Boulder campus in Boulder, Colorado. The cafeteria service area is approximately 2,700 sq ft consisting of 1,400 sq ft of seating (approximately 100 people), 325 sq ft of serving area, 600 sq ft of cooking/kitchen, 345 sq ft of refrigeration/storage, and approximately a 1,400 sq ft outdoor dining patio.</p>
<p>The prospective food service operator will manage and operate, independently of a federal agency, in a government owned facility with equipment and services provided. Existing cafeteria equipment includes serving lines, stoves, ovens, dishwashers, freezers, and refrigerators. Examples of services provided include utilities, telephone, janitorial, refuse pick-up, equipment maintenance, and security checks of all employees. The food service operator shall provide a variety of meals that are healthy, reasonably priced, and of interest to a majority of the 700 NIST and contract employees so as to ensure a strong customer base. The food service operator shall manage and operate all aspects of the cafeteria, including but not limited to: food purchasing, preparation and service, marketing, advertising, staffing, and maintain and repair all government furnished property. There will be no vending opportunity for this location outside of the caferteria. The operation must comply with all federal and state licensing entities, including a Hazard Analysis Plan and Safety Plan for the entire operation. NIST also requires that the food service provider have a strategy for buying green and a recycling plan.</p>
<p>The following information is illustrative of the current food services provided and shall not limit potential operators as to their business plan. Statistically, the present food service provider serves 150 to 200 people daily. Currently the cafeteria provides two meals a day, five days a week, and 52 weeks a year, excluding federal holidays. Breakfast is served between the hours of 6:30 am and 9:30 am with lunch served between the hours of 11:00 am and 1:00 pm. Opportunities also exist for catering of conferences and special events offered on a case by case basis. Each conference or special event is a different clientele and the durations of the meetings and number of attendees vary.

Many diagnosis and treatment decisions are made by heavily depending on image data (including images and reports). In today's medical environment, most patients have multiple encounters at geographically separate locations, with image data dispersed across a number of sites. The lack of ability to access medical image data across separate organizations results in significant problems: inadequate patient service due to absent data, delayed service due to ineffective image distribution solutions (film, CD, etc.), technology hurdles, and significant increases in cost and potential health risk due to duplicate image acquisition.<br /><br />Sharing image data through electronic health records (EHRs) through a network for image exchange will lead to better informed medical decisions, better analysis of medical outcomes, reductions in unnecessary expenses and improvements in the quality and safety of patient care. The value of patient care will improve, if systems at different locations are capable of managing, exchanging, and displaying medical information in its many forms, including images. Existing network infrastructure and technologies have great potential to solve the image sharing problem. In addition, an optimal solution could dramatically reduce overhead on the health care infrastructure.<br /><br />To this end, NIBIB has funded several endeavors over the last few years to establish basic infrastructures to promote the exchange of medical images across broad geographic areas within the United States. Several foundations have been identified in previous efforts for successful image sharing system, e.g. security, identity, privacy and confidentiality, consent and permissions, bandwidth, ease of use, etc.<br /><br />Today we have a limited set of solutions enabling interoperability of clinical information and image data. Patients and physicians need a better way to inform and access existing image exams and results with appropriate utilization. There is a need to develop and extend image sharing systems in the context of health information exchange and "meaningful use" of EHR.<br />There is a need for some standardization and common mechanisms to move data throughout our healthcare system. While the intent is not to stifle innovation, some underlying first principles of exchange can in fact foster innovation, by providing developers with a common reference framework upon which to deploy novel solutions.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose<br /><br /></span>The purpose of this contract is to develop a patient-centered and healthcare providers facilitated medical image sharing system where patients can directly visualize and control their images for effective and safe image sharing among radiologists and clinicians with broad participation from a large number of academic institutions, professional societies, and industry vendors.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor Requirements<br /></span><br />To be able to qualify for this contract, offerors must demonstrate that they have already institutionalized, at their respective institute, a sound medical image sharing system with which patients can control how and when they want to share their medical images. The image sharing system must be readily extended to meet the technical requirements. The offerors must also demonstrate, by themselves or by collaboration, the ability to include extremely broad expertise, such as medical imagers, radiologists, physical scientists, engineers and informatics specialists. The offerors must also demonstrate the capability of collaboration with a large number of academic institutions, industries that provide multiple imaging modalities and EHR solutions. Finally, the offerors must provide plans and measures to ensure that that the solution they developed under this contract will be readily disseminated and adopted by industry partners who have an EHR system in clinical use. In another word, NIBIB requires the offerors clearly define the sustainably model and pave the clear path for the successful translation of the developed image sharing system into clinical practice. <br /><br />&bull; Develop use cases for the extension of the existing institutionalized image sharing system. The use case must be based on real world scenarios of image examination workflow in health care environment and research environment and must address unmet needs or technical challenges. <br /><br />&bull; Implement the extension of the image sharing use cases based on the existing institutionalized image sharing system. <br /><br />&bull; Demonstrate consumer based control and ownership of their imaging exams through integration of Personal Health Records (PHRs) with the above system in a secure fashion, recognizing HIPAA requirements.<br /><br />&bull; Demonstrate that internet based imaging exchange is an extensible model in multiple venues, including the numerous venues of standard clinical care as well as in the research environment.<br /><br />&bull; Extend the current system to provide reference framework and metadata for data mining, quality assurance (QA), and structured reporting capability toward future "meaningful use" of image in EHR.<br /><br />&bull; Extend the current system to provide reference framework for comparative effectiveness analysis based on clinical indications and outcomes for providing better clinical decision support. <br /><br />&bull; Demonstrate that the offerors possess quality clinical and image data in their existing institutionalized system that can be leveraged, consolidated, integrated, aggregated, and de-identified for data mining, comparative effectiveness analysis and clinical decision support. <br /><br />&bull; Leverage the radiology ontologies, standard vocabularies, and structured radiology report whenever possible and appropriate.<br /><br />&bull; Develop partnership with industry and the community to facilitate the adoption of the solution as a reference for interoperability by industry and the community.<br /><br />&bull; Explore economic model and financial rewards scheme of image exchange to develop a sustainability model using the data generated from this contract or similar projects.<br /><br />&bull; Extend the current system to resolve remain issues in policy, safety, and security to enable the secure but transparent exchange of imaging exams throughout the healthcare systems into the rapidly emerging solutions that patients will be leveraging.<br /><br />&bull; Demonstrate novel approaches to allow patient-controlled and healthcare providers facilitated medical image sharing networks.<br /><br />&bull; Develop flexible end user preferences and permissions for patients easily to control the when, who, and what to sharing. Patients should be able to select individual images or report for sharing. Patient should also be able to cancel the permission or put a time limit on a shared image.
<p><br />At the end of the project, an evaluation of the patient-controlled medical image sharing system shall be conducted for:<br /><br />&bull; The reduction of the time and the cost for sharing and transferring longitudinal record among regional networks<br /><br />&bull; The reduction of the time and the cost for selecting images and export them to clinical study<br /><br />&bull; The efficiency and security of patient-controlled image sharing<br /><br />&bull; The benefits of such a patient-controlled medical image sharing network to patients, physicians and researchers</p>
<p>The period of performance is estimated to be for one (1) two year base period with one (1) two year option period.<br /><br />Interested parties should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-spaced and using 12-point font size minimum that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above and in the attached draft statement of work.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION(RFI) ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUESTFOR PROPOSAL (RFP).
This announcement is for a Requestfor Information (RFI).  SPAWARSystems Center-Pacific (SSC- Pacific) isseeking small business firms withrelevant knowledge, experience, andcapability to help the Governmentcreate a contract pricing structure forElectronics Packaging used by industryfor a potential firm fixed-priceIndefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity(IDIQ) contract forpackaging/assembly of MEMS devicesincluding a pilot run and a productionrun.
The potential effort encompasses allprocesses required to completelyassemble (package) a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) device.The typical assembly will consist of, butis not limited to, a MEMS die with adelicate moveable proof mass, aVertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser(VCSEL), a discrete monitorphotodiode, a resistive heatingelement, and spacer material.  Thesecomponents will be mounted in aceramic or plastic package andprecisely aligned to one another.  Wirebonding will provide the electricalconnection between the MEMSassembly and the package.Subsequent hermetic sealing invacuum or an inert atmosphere willfollow.   Please note that the assemblyprocess is not finalized and thatprocess development will be necessaryto achieve a final product (e.g. choiceof cascading solder alloys needs to beresearched and developed;component handling, alignment andspacing will need to be addressed).
Below are the pricing structurequestions that will assist SSC-Pacific increating a pricing structure commonwithin industry.  The intent is to createa contract with a firm fixed-price lineitem structure against which orders canthen be placed as the need arises.The contract would have a one-yearbase ordering period and two, one-yearoption periods.   Each Pilot Run shallnot exceed quantity 20 assemblies andeach Production Run shall not exceedquantity 100 assemblies.   Prices canbe different for each period to addressinflation.
Questions:
1.  How is Non-recurring Engineering(NRE) best priced?a) As a separate line item?b) Blended in with the price for a PilotRun or Production Run?c) Other method? Please explain.
2.  Describe what components make upyour NRE costs.
3.  Provide an example of how youwould structure fixed-price line itemsfor:      a.  Pilot run of 20 units (which canbe ordered in any increment)      b.  Production run of 100 units      Note:  Pricing is not requested atthis time.  We are merely researchingthe best methodology for establishinga menu of fixed-price contract lineitems against which orders can beplaced over a three-year period.
4.  How have you priced an assembly/MEMS packaging in past Governmentcontracts?
All written responses and commentsare requested to be received no laterthan 4:00pm on 9 May, 2011.
Thank you in advance for your timeand response to this RFI.

<DESC>Mine Roller Suspension Upgrade
Request for Information
RFI Number: M67854-11-I-5058



BACKGROUND The mission of Marine Corps mine rollers is to locate and detonate buried mines and IEDs.  Current mine roller technology limits effective operational speeds to 10-12 mph to prevent degraded performance from roller wheel-hop.  Advanced suspension systems with optimized damping and spring rate could significantly reduce unsprung mass and minimize wheel hop.

The Marine Corps Systems Command  Quantico, VA seeks information for a Mine Roller Kit that will minimize/eliminate roller wheel hop and is able to demonstrate threat detonation and threat-clearing effectiveness at higher operating speeds (25 mph and higher).
  Modifications that enhance the interrogation mission are also of interest.   

APPROACH The Government intends to review candidate systems based on technical maturity, effectiveness, ease-of-integration, and cost to determine if suitable systems exist. Candidate systems must be fully developed and be easily integrated on existing mine rollers.  This information will be used to support a planned upcoming procurement initiative to field this capability.

RESPONSES Potential offerrors with the ability to meet the requirements listed are requested to provide information on their solution, whether it is designs and test data, information on existing kits, or development and approach for the kit.
  Responses should include the firms business size, SBA certification, and GSA schedule contract number, as applicable, and a rough-order of magnitude (ROM) price for one (1) kit. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government for any follow-on action. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.

The Government recognizes that proprietary information and data may be part of this effort.
 Such data should be clearly marked and included as a proprietary addendum to the non-restricted/non proprietary information. Responses to this RFI shall be e-mailed to Thomas Anable at thomas.anable@usmc.mil or sent to the address below no later than 2:00 PM EST on 21 April 2011. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Procurement. The Government intends to issue a sole-source acquisition to repair the existing firing range at OFFUTT AFB, NE. No other contractor is capable of providing this service due to the unique proprietary ability to repair said system. SAVAGE RANGE SYSTEM is the sole provider of these items currently installed at Offutt AFB. The Government requires a repair and/or replacement of specific parts of the Savage Range System. The 55th Contracting Squadron intends to award a Firm Fixed Price purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because SAVAGE RANGE SYSTEM is the manufacturer and only authorized maintainer. The procurement of this repair must be completed in a timely manner in order to meet mission requirements. Questions should be directed to Scott DeLoera in writing via email to: scott.deloera@offutt.af.mil or via facsimile at (402) 294-7280.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan lines-together; mso-layout-grid-align: none">The Nation's transportation system is in transformation. With rapid evolution in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) technologies encouraged by public and private sector research investments, the Nation's transportation systems are experiencing unprecedented innovations aimed at significant improvements in transportation safety, mobility and reduction of environmental impacts across all modes of transportation. New vehicular technologies, positioning systems, mapping and navigation systems, telecommunications to include available dedicated short range communication (DSRC) bandwidth, in-vehicle devices, and new roadside communication devices are enabling technologies that, together with the newly available data, will define the next wave of transportation systems. The USDOT believes that solid research is required to pioneer advancements of the nation's transportation system with reduced risks and high return on investment. This RFI intends to obtain input from the general public to assist the FHWA in the establishment of a Transportation Operations Laboratory (TOL) at the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center as part of the national transportation research efforts.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 3pt"><span style="mso-bidi-language: EN-US">The TOL </span>includes three testbeds:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>a Data Resources Testbed, a Concepts and Analysis Testbed, and a Cooperative Vehicle-Highway Testbed. These testbeds will be used to support the FHWA's research programs.</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 0in .5in 1.5in 2.0in 2.5in 3.0in 3.5in 4.0in 4.5in 5.0in 5.5in 6.0in 6.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-language: EN-US">Data Resources Testbed</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-language: EN-US">The Data Resources Testbed will provide researchers access to live and archived multi-source data </span>(i.e. any relevant data)<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-language: EN-US"> to support transportation system performance measurement and transportation system management applications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These multi-source data include data from traditional roadway sensors, data from vehicle probes, data from personal mobile devices, data from transit and freight operators, as well as data from any other relevant sources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The testbed will have the following capabilities:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>access, host, federate, assemble and archive traffic application data; analyze operations and performance; provide advanced visualization tools to improve situational awareness; and aid strategic program and tactical operations decision making.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The testbed will access and host real world data from a variety of sources (potentially decentralized) to support research and development in transportation system performance measurement and transportation system management. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-language: EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Concepts and Analysis Testbed</strong></p>
<p>The Concepts and Analysis Testbed will incorporate a repository of transportation tools at the macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic levels to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">enable traffic simulation runs and visualizations of representative traffic networks. This suite of traffic analysis tools will support fundamental transportation research and experimentation to quantitatively assess the potential mobility, environmental, and safety impacts of transformative transportation management strategies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The tools include:</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software products; software development tools; customized COTS products; products of national research projects; internal research products; and associated datasets, with illustrative demonstration data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This library of associated data sets will preserve analytical capital (e.g., calibrated tool input files) from ongoing or completed modeling and simulation projects. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In addition, the testbed will provide a repository of authoritative and representative calibration and validation datasets associated with ongoing or completed field tests that will enable technical and performance measures to be compared in realistic scenarios and across projects, regardless of partner and perhaps even choice of model platform, so that valid assessments can be made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The testbed will allow FHWA research staff to refine the experimental strategies through direct interaction with tools and data to determine the strategies' potential value to various stakeholders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The outputs of simulation analyses can, for example, provide an authoritative basis for conducting benefit/cost analyses of proposed management strategies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The testbed and its resources will be used to improve the consistency, quality, efficiency, transparency, and availability of research results and government deliverables.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The testbed will be used by consultants supporting FHWA research projects, and other onsite or external researchers. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Cooperative Vehicle-Highway Testbed</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The Cooperative Vehicle-Highway Testbed (CVHT) will enable FHWA to explore the enabling technologies for Vehicle to Infrastructure (V-I) applications and to assess the potential of new transportation services based upon cooperative systems and wireless communication.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The CVHT will leverage previous investments by the US DOT in FHWA's Intelligent Intersection (a signalized intersection on the TFHRC grounds with vehicle-infrastructure communication) and can encourage additional investments by FHWA, the ITS program, and others in facilities, equipment, and services that will enable the CVHT to support critical research priorities and projects. The facilities, equipment, staff support, and other resources of the CVHT will enable FHWA researchers to develop prototypes, install systems in the infrastructure and on vehicles, and conduct tests directed to investigate and answer key research questions needed to advance research and development efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The CVHT will initially use existing facilities at the TFHRC, including service roads that allow access to the Intelligent Intersection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the need to conduct more extensive tests, including service concepts involving various stages of vehicle control and automation, will likely require additional specialized test track facilities at TFHRC.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 3pt"><span style="mso-bidi-language: EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The three testbeds in the TOL will all work together. Collectively, these testbeds will reside in an integrated environment that supports essential functions for online/offline analysis, visualization, data collection/processing, and monitoring the field devices and controls used for the testbeds. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The TOL consists of field devices, equipped vehicles, databases, and data intelligence/engines, data sources, and a suite of advanced analysis/development tools to be defined to support research and technology experiments and evaluation. </span></p>

<DESC>The SEC has a sole source requirement to obtain through a short-term extension approximately 43,701 rentable square feet (rsf) of office and storage space to continue housing the SEC Atlanta Regional Office ("ARO") at One Live Oak, 3475 Lenox Road, Atlanta, Georgia. The SEC lease expires June 19, 2011. The extension will be for a six (6) month term at which time the ARO will be relocated to Atlanta Plaza, 950 E. Paces Ferry Rd., Atlanta, Georgia. The Atlanta Plaza property won the most recent competitive lease acquisition.
<p>This requirement arose as a result of a delay in the SFO development stage involving the SEC's security requirements language. Although planning was done to allow sufficient time to conduct a full and open competition for the follow on lease, the schedule was delayed mainly by the efforts of the Leasing and Security Branches in developing an integrated process to address security requirements language to be used for all lease procurements. Both branches were newly established and this process had not previously be memorialized with roles and responsibilities identified, nor was there SFO language that reflected the agency's security requirements.</p>
<p>The Leasing Branch conducted a market survey in October 2009 after posting a notice on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Final approval on the SFO security language was not received until May 2010. This delayed the acquisition process by several months. The new lease was executed on December 9, 2010. The construction project schedule for build out of the new space indicates move-in around the February 2012 timeframe.</p>
<p>The SEC has determined that it is in the best interest of the agency to obtain a short-term extension rather than allow the current lease to expire and go into a holdover status. Holdover could result in a premium rental rate.</p>

Due to an urgent and compelling need, the proposed contract action is for supplies using simplified acquisition procedures, for which the Government intends to conduct an oral solicitation under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(c) for surgical staple reloads for the Puget Sound Health Care System's Seattle VA Medical Center.

<DESC>This is a notice of proposed contract action. It is posted for information purposes only.
<p>The Egyptian Personnel Support Services (EPSS) contract provides support for the United States Department of Defense and contractor personnel located in Egypt who are on permanent or temporary duty assignments, performing services under Foreign Military Sales program on behalf of the Egyptian Air Force. Some of the services include management/maintenance of housing/utilities, furniture/appliances, vehicles, and building/equipment; medial, fire protection, security support, convenience stores, custodial service, grounds maintenance, recreation and dining halls. The services shall be performed in Egypt.<br /><br />The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) intends to invoke the Extension of Services clause to extend the current contract for six (6) months at the rates in effect at the time of the extension. This is a short term effort to bridge the gap between the current contract and the competitive follow-on of the EPSS contract that ends 30 Nov 2011. The Government plans to award to the incumbent. There is no transition period and the requirement is for full-up support on day one. The unstable political situation has impacted the source selection schedule for the competitive follow-on.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p><br />This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.

COMMERCIAL ITEM DESCRIPTION:  The USPFO for Arizona has a requirement for Professional Development Training Workshop, curriculum, and customized educational materials associated with the Combat and Operational Stress Fist Aid.<br><br>STATEMENT OF WORK<br>For Professional Development Training Workshop (PDTW)<br>Combat and Operational Stress First Aid (COSFA) development workshop FY-11<br>For the Arizona National Guard<br><br>1.0  INTRODUCTION<br><br>1.1  Purpose.  The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide contractor support to develop and deliver a Professional Development Training Workshop (PDTW) for Arizona National Guard Service Members and their Families.  Further, the Arizona National Guard requires contract support to hold a symposium and planning meeting to develop a National Guard Combat and Operational Stress First Aid (COSFA) curriculum to be delivered at one PDTW for the Arizona National Guard Service Members and their Families.<br><br>1.2  Background.  Family Programs in conjunction with the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program are responsible for sponsoring, developing and presenting the COSFA model for Arizona National Guard Service Members and families.  The PDTW will be an ongoing event conducted in Phoenix, Arizona, beginning upon the approval of the contract and continuing when services are requested. The purpose of the PDTW is to prepare the above personnel personally and professionally to facilitate and provide crisis care and awareness for Arizona National Guard personnel and other authorized members of the Department of the Army. The COSFA development workshop will also ensure that Arizona National Guard Service Members are prepared to effectively deliver inclusive operational stress care and provide training to other Service Members to help identify Service Members and their Families who are at risk. <br><br>The Arizona National Guard has identified the need and will implement the developed model of Combat Stress First Aid (COSFA) to be used in the aftermath of crisis events, which differs from traditional models of immediate stress intervention.  The COSFA implementation will create a curriculum, which will be developed into a PDTW held in Phoenix, Arizona, at the Arizona National Guard Papago Park Military Reservation upon approval of the contract and for future dates upon request. There will also be a second three-day PDTW conducted in the future at a later date to be determined. The curriculum shall entail the following components: 1. Introduction to the framework of the COSFA model, 2. Skills based training on how to use the stress first aid model for individuals in crisis, 3. How to use the stress first aid model to respond to units in distress, and 4. How to guide commands on the use and utility of the COSFA model.<br><br>1.3  Scope.  The contractor shall develop and deliver a Professional Development Training Course (PDTC). This project will require development of a curriculum and relevant training support materials, curriculum validation and curriculum implementation. A select representative group determined by the Arizona National Guard will validate the curriculum upon approval of the contract, which will be held at the Arizona National Guard Papago Park Military Reservation in Phoenix, Arizona. <br><br>The contractor shall develop all logistical needs to create a three-day conference to implement COSFA as a crisis intervention into the Arizona National Guard.  The outcome of this conference will be the development and validation of a content and curriculum, as well as trained personnel within the National Guard who will be able to inform and educate other potential trainers and provide services to those Service Members and families needing crisis intervention. This PDTW will be delivered in Phoenix, Arizona.<br><br>1.4  Security Classification.  This SOW and the initial training materials under procurement are unclassified.<br><br>2.0  APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS<br><br>The following specifications shall apply to this project:<br><br>2.1  Military Standards.  <br><br>MIL-PRF 29612B, Performance Specification, Training Data Products<br>MIL-HDBKs 29612B, Parts 1-5, Training Data Products<br><br>2.2  Technical References.  <br><br>International Association of Continuing Education and Training (IACET.

The COSFA training will address the purpose, function, limitations, applicability and scope of advisement on the tactical, operational and strategic levels.  It will also address the derivative tasks of advisement to include participation in military operations and in the development of moral and ethical maturity of Service Members, families, and friends. <br><br>The development of the PDTW will provide training based upon recognizing when someone, more specifically Service Members, are in distress, breaking the code of silence that is present with the Service Member, and engaging the Service Member to connect to the next level of support needed.  The function of this model is to properly inform Arizona National Guard Service Members and their Families of the COSFA model, train them in individual and unit intervention strategies and work with and inform command of the functionality of the COSFA model as an evidence based model of care for personnel and units, which can act as a force multiplier.<br><br>Objectives:<br>At the conclusion of the COSFA training, 20 newly validated trainers will be able to:<br><br>(1)  Understand the COSFA model and the intent behind the "Be Resilient" Program.<br><br>(2)  Describe the function, scope and limitations of advisement in executing the command's mission, including the management of issues related to the impact of military operations and wartime missions.<br><br>(3)  Identify the derivative tasks of advisement.

The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer ;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determine at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)<br />(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; competitive proposals are not being requested and any other written solicitation will not be issued.  Responsible sources could elect to submit a capability statement, or quotation, which will be considered by the contracting activity.<br><br>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command intends to award, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed priced contract for commercial services to FLIR Systems, Inc. in Wilsonville, Oregon , cage code 64869 (FLIR).  This action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  The contemplated contract is to satisfy repair and refurbishment requirements of fielded Product Management Office for Integrated Tactical Systems' (PMO ITS) surveillance and target acquisition systems.  The contract will include a one (1) year base period; to include repairs/refurbishment of sensors/cameras, integrated logistics support (ILS) and 24/7 help desk support (24/7), with four (4) one-year options for each sensor/camera to be repaired or refurbished, ILS and 24/7.  The period of performance, to include any exercised options, will be five years.  Anticipated award date is June 1, 2011.  The estimated contract value is $58,923,824.00.  <br><br>The PMO ITS is responsible for providing the maintenance and sustainment (supply) support of the Legacy RAID and RAID BETSS-C, CERBERUS, and CERBERUS Lite systems that are fielded.  Major subsystems of the Legacy RAID and RAID BETSS-C CERBERUS, and CERBERUS Lite systems are the StarSAFIRE III, StarSAFIRE HD, Ranger III, and RECON III sensors/cameras.  This procurement action is for the repair and return (R&R), or refurbishment, and logistics support of these sensors/cameras (StarSAFIRE III, StarSAFIRE HD, Ranger III, and RECON III) directly from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) which is FLIR.  This action also includes ILS and 24/7 help desk, and data submissions requirements.  The R&R or refurbishment of Government-owned sensors/cameras meets the definition of commercial services as set forth in FAR Part 2.101.  The contractor shall conduct initial inspections and diagnostic activities to determine required repairs and/or refurbishments.  The contractor shall maintain a spare parts stock level, adequate repair facilities, and technical repair personnel sufficient to repair and refurbish the failed sensor/components and return them to service within the objective mean time to repair.  The repair turnaround time (RTAT) shall be no greater than 25 days unless excluded by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).  A Statement of Work (SOW) will be provided directly to FLIR.<br><br>The services are deemed available only from FLIR.  As stated in the paragraph above, FLIR is the OEM of the StarSAFIRE III, StarSAFIRE HD, and Ranger III XR+ sensors.  These sensors are part of existing PMO ITS systems and replacement sensors must be identical to and interchangeable with the original items.  The existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes; the control of basic raw material; or similar circumstances, make the supplies and services available only from FLIR.  FLIR owns the intellectual property for all these sensors/cameras and maintains tight control over that property for competitive and investment reasons.  FLIR has proprietary control of the schematics, plans, drawings, special tools, fixtures and calibration instrumentation and methods.  Additionally, FLIR holds copyrights and patents that apply to these specific models of sensors.  It has been determined that FLIR is the sole manufacturer of the sensors/cameras.  Furthermore, it has been determined that FLIR is the sole manufacturer of the components used for repair on the StarSAFIRE III, StarSAFIRE HD, Ranger III, and RECON III sensors/cameras. For the following reasons, FLIR is the only source capable of providing the repair/refurbishments in a timely and cost effective manner.  The Government does not have depot capability to repair these sensors/cameras.  Furthermore, the introduction of disparate parts into existing sensor/camera units would require additional testing to ensure the parts met operational and interoperability requirements.<br><br>FLIR has the knowledge, expertise, experience and source of parts to perform the repairs in a timely manner without disrupting the readiness, fielding and sustainment of existing StarSAFIRE III, StarSAFIRE HD, Ranger III, and RECON III sensors/cameras.  No other known source can satisfy the requirements without negatively impacting the US soldiers since substantial duplication of cost to the US is not expected to be recovered through competition and the Government will experience unacceptable delays in filling the Army needs.<br><br>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this action is directed towards FLIR Systems, Inc.  This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal from FLIR only.  A SOW will be sent to FLIR's representative in a separate document.  Provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-50, effective March 16, 2011.  The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  Because this is an authorized sole source procurement the evaluation procedures outline in FAR 52.212-2 are not applicable.  Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer.  FAR clauses at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, and 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition.  The resulting contract will be incrementally funded in accordance with Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 252.232-7007.  DFARS provision 252.201-7000, Contracting Officer's Representative, is also applicable to this acquisition.  Additional terms and conditions consistent with customary commercial practices applicable to this acquisition will be discussed with the offeror during negotiations.  A Defense Priorities and Allocations System rating DO-A7 has been assigned to this acquisition.<br><br><br>All responses and/or inquiries should be directed to Neisha M. Mendiola at neisha.mendiola@smdc.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from publication of this combined synopsis/solicitation.  No telephone inquires will be accepted.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Best Value Evaluation. For this procurement, the Best Value determination will be made based on a Lowest Price Technical Acceptable (LPTA) approach. <br />(a) Technical Acceptability: The Government will first evaluate the Technical Acceptability of all timely quotes. Vendors shall quote on all line items in the Bid Schedule. Any response/quotation that fails to cite a price for each item or fails to make an entry that indicates line item will be provided at no charge will be rejected as Technically Unacceptable. A vendor's quote/response will be determined technically acceptable if it meets the requirements of this paragraph and the following factor is determined Technically Acceptable. Any quote that fails to meet the requirements of this paragraph or is rated technically unacceptable in the factor below will be technically unacceptable overall and will be ineligible for award.<br />(i) Factor 1: Technical Evaluation. In order to be determined Technically Acceptable for this factor, vendors must provide a quote on line items. Item quotes must list the manufacturer and part number and must be accompanied by literature and/or a brochure including photographs and/or drawings. The descriptive literature must demonstrate how the proposed meets the characteristics listed in the PWS. <br />(b) Evaluation: Next, the Government will conduct a price evaluation of all Technically Acceptable quotes. The price evaluation will consist of a comparison of all Technically Acceptable quotes submitted with each other. Prices will be ranked by total evaluated price. <br />5. Best Value Determination. The lowest priced technically acceptable quote/response will be determined to represent the Best Value. Award will be made to the vendor whose quote is the lowest evaluated price among all technically acceptable quotes.<br />6. "Descriptive Literature" FAR 52.214-21, applies to this RFQ. Descriptive literature is required with any submission. Failure to provide descriptive literature will be cause for rejection of your quote. Additionally, if the descriptive literature fails to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of the solicitation, the Government will reject the quote.<br />The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1 - Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items. Addendum: The following paragraph is tailored as follows: Para (c), Period for Acceptance of Quotes. The vendor agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 60 calendar days for the date specified for receipt of quotes. Interested parties may submit a written offer in accordance with FAR 52.212-1. Offers submitted orally will not be accepted. Your quote must include discount terms, delivery date, tax identification number, cage code, and DUNS number.

Award shall be made to that vendor without further consideration of any other quote.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with vendors.

<DESC>1.  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  See Numbered Note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.  The services will consist of core drilling and geotechnical subsurface sampling via continuous and/or standard SPT techniques, large diameter coring within rock units, sonic drilling, vibracoring, field and in situ testing, geophysical site investigations, field and laboratory testing of materials (including construction Q/A testing), chemical analytical laboratory testing, site preparation, and establishing coordinate locations for projects located within the Florida boundaries of the Jacksonville District, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Caribbean area.  The primary purpose of these proposed contracts are to provide services for projects located within the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  Secondarily, these contracts may be used to provide services within the geographic boundaries of the other U.S. Army Corps of Engineers districts within the South Atlantic Division.  The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services to be performed outside the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts.  It is the intent of the Government to initially award two (2) contracts, one (1) contract from the 8(a) set aside and one (1) Small Business set aside.  However, if there are no highly qualified 8(a) small businesses, the award will be made from the highly qualified small business firms.  No one firm will receive more than one award as a result of this solicitation.  Only firms considered highly qualified will be awarded a contract.  Indefinite delivery contracts will be negotiated and awarded from this solicitation with subsequent work issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders.  This announcement will result in up to two (2) awards.  Criteria used in allocating task orders among contracts include performance and quality of deliverables under current task orders, current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time, specialized experience, equitable distribution of the work among the contractors, and other relevant factors.  The contracts will be for a period of one year from date of award, with options to extend for four additional years; not to exceed a total of five years.  While the estimated dollar amount per year is $1,000,000.00, the actual obligation per year may be greater than or less than the $1,000,000.00.  Maximum order limit is $5,000,000 for the life of the contract, including options.  The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense.  The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered.  For more information, visit the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.

<p>Background &amp; Description <br />The EPS program is a follow-on to the operational Interim Polar System and will meet the communication needs of the user community above 65 deg North latitude. The EPS communications capability is based upon the Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveform, communications security, transmission security, and cryptology approaches. EPS mission control and mission planning will be independent of the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system while EPS key management will interface with the AEHF Key Management Architecture (KMA). <br />This Request for Information (RFI) by the USAF Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Directorate seeks industry feedback on capabilities for the following approaches: <br />1. Develop an architecture and prototype ground segment for the Enhanced Polar System (EPS) and transition these products to an operational system post milestone B (assuming 3Q FY12 Authority to Proceed (ATP));</p>
<p>2. Provide Approach 1 above, plus discuss the capabilities for EPS System Engineering, Integration, and Test (SEIT) activities.</p>
<p>The Government would appreciate feedback on the feasibility of coupling EPS ground segment development with EPS system level SEIT functions currently performed by the Government.<br />Functions of the EPS ground segment are:<br />1.

<DESC>The solicitation number N44852002 for the installation of a new floor in the laboratory animal facility area of NAMRU-6 has been canceled.
<p>Due to a very tight scientific research schedule, we have been unable to find a block of time free for the flooring work. As the facility has to be in use 24 hours per day and 7 days per week, we cannot schedule the work after hours or on weekends/holidays. We posted the solicitation with the understanding from the researchers that a period of time would be available to complete the job. This turned out to be incorrect.<br /><br />If you submitted a proposal we are very sorry for your lost time and resources. Your name will be maintained on our mailing list and you will be contacted if we decide to re-open the flooring project. You may contact Mr. Heath Westcott, Director for Administration, at 511-614-4173; e-mail address: Jeremy.Westcott@med.navy.mil if you have any questions.</p>

<DESC>NOTE:&nbsp; There are no formatting requirements or page limits for responses to this RFI.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />AIR FORCE MEDICAL MODELING AND SIMULATION PROGRAM - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE AND DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ); IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p>This document shall serve as the overall parent document for the attached RFIs. It consists of five separate RFIs that will be used within the Air Force Medical Modeling and Simulation (AFMM&amp;S) Program's enterprise delivery of cutting-edge medical education and training. The competing missions of war, beneficiary care, homeland security, natural disaster and pandemic response training have put huge demands on the military medical service. Due to the dissimilar nature of civilian versus battlefield trauma and the low volume of cases, training opportunities fall short in offering adequate preparation for the management of battlefield trauma.<br /><br />The Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) must bridge this gap with new technology that offers distributed training in virtual environments using medical gaming scenarios, and with synthetic tissue that mimics characteristics of live tissue and tissue tool surgery. These five RFIs are portions of an overarching knowledge management strategy. The AFMS will access web based technology leveraging a cloud computing strategy that will link medical gaming simulations and virtual environments hosted on Department of Defense (DoD), Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) certified server(s). Performance metrics will be created, tracked and archived within an enterprise-wide Learning Management System. Broadband will be adequate to support single as well as multiplayer gaming as well as multiple user access. Content will be available in the deployed setting and by portable device. Validation research will be conducted to determine adequacy of training, skill acquisition, and clinical performance when deployed and in garrison to include impact on team training and resultant patient safety data.</p>
<p>As you prepare your response, review all RFI areas and projects. The Air Force desires that the web based system components be compatible and interoperable.<br /><br />Five RFI Areas</p>
<p>1. Medical Training Virtual Environments <br />2. Medical Gaming <br />3. Learning Management System<br />4. Synthetic Tissue Model <br />5. Virtual Reality with Haptic Feedback</p>
<p>Responders can provide a response for a single RFI, all five RFIs, or any combination thereof. Each RFI will contain a clear response to each of the desired capabilities (referred to as Key Performance Parameters and Key System Attributes). Desired capabilities are explained in greater depth in paragraph 4 below. Responses to this RFI are due by 4 PM (1600) CDT, four weeks from the date of posting.</p>
<p>The following paragraphs are applicable in their entirety to each of the five RFI without exception!</p>
<p>1. SUBJECT: The Air Force Medical Information Test Bed (AFMISTB) is conducting market research for an AFMM&amp;S technology research and development program capability that will provide AFMS personnel validated, standardized and effective strategic, tactical, and operational training world-wide via virtual learning environments and using realistic synthetic tissue models.</p>
<p>2. DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation for a proposal or quote from the DoD or the United States Air Force (USAF). Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the government as such nor will they be considered by the Government as a binding contract.</p>
<p>Responders may submit RFIs on as many of the five areas as they choose; however, they must submit a single response for each RFI area they are responding to. Respondents are solely responsible for any and all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI marked as "proprietary" will be handled in accordance with existing business practices. It will be assumed by the government that a responder has legal right to use the technology or other elements of their response without restriction. Information provided as a response to the RFI will not be returned to the originator, but will be protected as proprietary information. Other than questions associated with this RFI, AFMISTB will not entertain any questions concerning the composition, requirements, or the nature of services to be performed under any future RFIs, RFQs, or RFPs associated with information outside the scope of the AFMM&amp;S Program.</p>
<p>3. BACKGROUND: The Air Force Medical Support Agency Requirements Division (AFMSA/SG5R) has identified a need for the development of synthetic tissue and virtual learning environments at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels of Air Force medical operations. This strategy is conducive to recruiting and delivering training to a generation of Americans who grew up in the digital age. To provide this required capability within the context of the above operational environment and the Surgeon General's intent, it is imperative the AFMS develop and implement a course of action for an AFMM&amp;S technology research and development program.</p>
<p>Traditional methods of providing medical readiness, currency, sustainment, team, and graduate medical education training in central locations are insufficient for the scope, complexity, and flexibility of required medical knowledge, expertise and technical proficiency. Specifically there is a shortage of standardized training curriculum, trainers, funds, time allocated for training, and lack of effective means to expose trainees to appropriate learning situations. Increased use of modeling and simulation by the military services and the field of medicine and surgery has become an integral means to overcome these barriers. Research has also shown that virtual environments provide an immersive learning experience and, when coupled with haptic (tactile) feedback, can simulate real life situations and teach learners how to plan and manage potential complications. Medical gaming has been shown to improve cognitive function and critical thinking skills. Also, synthetic tissue development that mimics biological functions can augment live tissue training. A learning management system will capture all performance metrics from each system to track outcome measures over time.</p>
<p>AFMISTB is seeking information about academic, prototypical, developmental, foreign, and domestic commercially available products that meet or can be readily modified to meet the requirements discussed above (and identified in each separate RFI). Anyone who can offer DIACAP approved commercial off-the-shelf (COTS),Government off-the-shelf (GOTS), or research and development (R&amp;D) options that fulfill the capabilities outlined above (and/or each of the attached RFI's) should respond to this RFI.</p>
<p>4. REQUIREMENTS: The AFMMST Program concept establishes the requirement and foundation for research, development, and operational testing of novel modeling and simulation training environments and standardized educational curricula. The concept includes, but is not limited to technologies related to standards of care for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and maintenance of clinical health problems of concern to beneficiaries of military healthcare, trauma management and aerospace expeditionary operations.</p>
<p>AFMSA/SG5R assembled a high performance team (HPT) composed of subject matter experts (SME) who identified the requirements needed to fill the capability gap. They categorized the requirements into two main groups: Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and Key System Attributes (KSA). The KPPs are mandatory requirements while the KSAs are other key system attributes.<br />Each of the following RFIs contains a list of specific KPPs and KSAs. There is some overlap in these as Service and Joint requirements require standardization to ensure intra and interoperability among systems and standardization in both system and networking security infrastructure and procedures. Responses to an RFI should address all of the requirements identified in that particular unique set of requirements.</p>
<p>Submission should comply with "open architecture" standards to the extent practical. ANY sole or proprietary solutions must be clearly identified in the RFI response.</p>
<p>5. CONTACT INFORMATION: Response to this RFI must be submitted to Mr. James (Levie) Herndon Office Manager, AFMISTB via e-mail at levie.herndon.ctr@us.af.mil. Responses must be received on or before 4 PM (1600) CDT four weeks from the date of posting of the RFI. This RFI is not a commercial solicitation. The Government will not pay for any information submitted, or for any costs associated with providing the information.<br /><br />Please include the number and name of the RFI or RFI areas you are responding to, a point of contact, phone number, e-mail address, website information, and indicate whether the company is a foreign or US-domestic entity in the contents of the e-mail.</p>
<p>Responses should describe the company's capability to offer, field, and sustain an AFMMST Technology research and development program as characterized by the requirements addressed in the RFI.s If unable to provide an AFMMST Technology research and development program capable of meeting all identified requirements, the respondent should offer tradeoff considerations.</p>
<p>6. LATE SUBMISSIONS: Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future competition, nor will information provided in response to this RFI be used to exclude anyone from responding to any future requests for proposals. Communications with AFMISTB with regard to this RFI will only be permitted in writing during the RFI response period.<br />Responses to the RFI received by AFMISTB after the submittal deadline and time indicated may be considered. The respondent assumes the risk of the method of dispatch chosen. Postmarking by the submittal date and time shall not substitute for actual response receipt.</p>
<p>7. OWNERSHIP OF RESPONSE TO RFI: All informational material submitted in response to this request will become property of USAF. Physical samples will be returned to the vendor at the owner's written requests and their own expense.</p>
<p>8. RELEASE OF CLAIMS, LIABILITY, AND PREPARATION EXPENSES: Under no circumstances shall AFMISTB be responsible for any response preparation expenses, submission costs, or any other expenses, costs, or damages, of whatever nature incurred as a result of the respondent's participation in this RFI process. The respondent understands and agrees that it submits its response at its own risk and expense, and releases AFMISTB from any claim for damages or other liability arising out of the RFI process.</p>
<p>9. ERRORS IN RESPONSE: AFMISTB shall not be liable for any errors in respondent's response. The respondent is responsible for careful review of its entire response to ensure that all information is correct and complete. The respondent is liable for all errors or omissions contained in its responses.</p>
<p>10. ADDENDUM: AFMISTB reserves the right to issue an addendum to this RFI at any time, for any reason.</p>

The Lemon House is recognized as a building which adds to the architectural history of Western Pennsylvania.

The purpose of this contract is to provide for the fabrication and installation of reproduction floor cloths in two downstairs service areas of the Lemon House: the central hallway and the double dining room (rooms 100, 103, and 104 on the attached floor plan).  The reproductions will be based on the floor cloths currently in use in those areas: a diamond pattern with marbling and a simple border offset for the staircase in the hallway and a black and white checkerboard pattern with a simple border in the double dining room
3.  SCOPE OF WORK

The painting shall be done with latex paints, and they shall be coated with not less than four coats of a high-quality water-based varnish.  A lighter weight raw canvas shall be used as underlayment to compensate for uneven floorboards.  The floor cloths presently in use have been executed in black and white.  Photographs of the existing floor cloths, a drawing of the overall pattern and a floor plan showing the locations of the floor cloths will be provided to the contractor.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes, as part of market research led by the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS) 7C, Surface Ship Training Directorate, to identify potential sources to produce Integrated Training Systems (ITS)/Battle Force Tactical Training (BFTT) systems.

The BFTT system provides Commanding Officers, Battle Group Commanders and the Afloat Training Group (ATG) with the ability to conduct coordinated, realistic, high stress, combat system team training while inport and at-sea.  BFTT supports both individual unit level and integrated force level training including joint, as well as providing an organic training capability to support requirements defined in the Surface Force Training Manual.
  Additionally, the installation of a realistic shipboard team training capability supports infrastructure to the ships.

The BFTT system is a highly flexible, interactive simulation/stimulation tactical combat training system. It addresses all warfare areas and provides through an open architecture, scenario generation and control, simulation of friendly and enemy forces and stimulation of organic shipboard sensors, data acquisition, reconstruction, and operator/unit performance feedback, and connectivity with external scenario control and communication.

PEO IWS 7C requires ITS/BFTT systems for installation on naval vessels and selected shore sites.  The production effort will include the procurement of parts and components, and the assembly, integration, testing, labeling, storage, and delivery of ITS/BFTT.
 A limited number of pre-manufactured components procured from other vendors will be supplied as Government-Furnished Material (GFM) for integration and installation into ITS/BFTT.

An ITS/BFTT unit consists of three militarized 19-inch standard equipment racks, populated with various Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and GFM components, as follows: One (1) BFTT Operator Processor Console (BOPC) rack, one (1) populated Equipment Rack 1 (ER 1), and one (1) populated Equipment Rack 2 (ER 2).

Additional information to consider when responding to this request for information:

 The Government will provide production level drawings and 3-D models in SolidWorks  format as GFI.
 The Government will provide system specifications, documentation, part numbers and system operational test procedures.
 The completed systems must meet US Navy requirements for shipboard installation including environment and shock.
 Additional technical support services such as production engineering, system design, and logistical expertise will be required.
 Production requirements may vary from one (1) unit to twenty-four (24) unit per year.

Interested firms should identify and describe in sufficient detail their experience in parts procurement, logistics or supply chain management, assembling, integrating and testing shipboard or other similar electronic rack mounted equipment; and ability to provide the additional technical support services required and identified above.

Your response may be evaluated by non-government Contractor Support Personnel who have signed nondisclosure agreements.
 NAVSEA will accept submissions marked Business Sensitive.  NAVSEA will not accept telephone communications for additional information.

NAVSEA makes no commitment to issue a solicitation, award a contract or be responsible to pay for any information provided and no basis for claims against the Government shall arise for any monies expended by any interested parties in responding to this market research.

If a decision to proceed is made by NAVSEA the estimated timeframe is as follows: Solicitation Release  July 2011; Award  March 2012; FAT  July 2012; FRP  October 2012. Note: These are estimates only and subject to change.

Interested firms are requested to submit a capabilities statement of no more than 6 pages in length, including any photographs or drawings, within 15 days of the date of this posting.
 Submissions must include company name, size classification, address, point-of-contact, as well as any unique qualifiers identified below.

Capability statements must be submitted electronically in Microsoft Word format (Office 2007 or earlier) or Portable Document Format (PDF) to the following email address: David.Krute@navy.mil

Small business concerns that comply with the aforementioned size classification are encouraged to respond, indicating their status under the subordinate subcategories, if applicable, e.g., as small disadvantaged small business, women-owned small business, disabled veteran-owned small business, etc.

The information provided and received in response to this announcement is subject to the conditions set forth in FAR 51.213-3 as set forth below:

52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes.

As prescribed in 15.209(c), insert the following provision:

<DESC><strong>Question and Answers to RFI:</strong>&nbsp; <br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Question 1:<br /></span></strong>Unable to decipher the sentences on "three key components for corrosion and biological control" and on "key technologies .that are necessary for the implementation of IUHS". The RFI said, "level1fol; tab-stops...etc" which was not intelligible in my copy.
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response:</span></strong></p>
<p>The correct text for the sections of the RFI noted are:</p>
<p>The underwater hulls of U. S. Navy ships have three key components for corrosion and biological fouling control:</p>
<p>(1)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cathodic Protection (CP) to protect exposed metallic materials</p>
<p>(2)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An anti-corrosion coating (AC) system<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>to reduce exposed bare metallic surface area</p>
<p>(3)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An anti-fouling (AF) coating system to minimize the effects of biological growth that increases drag and correspondingly fuel consumption.</p>
<p>Some key technologies of interest that are anticipated to be necessary for the implementation of IUHS are:</p>
<p>(1)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dynamic system control that provides control of anodes and other system components</p>
<p>(2)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Materials for permanent anodes</p>
<p>(3)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Electrical disinfection system</p>
<p>(4)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Electrolytic antifouling systems</p>
<p>(5)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Diagnostic/prognostic tools for the integrated system and for individual components</p>
<p>(6)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Multipurpose anodes design</p>
<p>(7)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Anode grouping concepts and design including ability to provide coverage and address electrical connectivity issues</p>
<p>(8)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Control for concurrent vs. selective operation (single model or multiple mode operation of the integrated system)</p>
<p>All three prevention modes running</p>
<p>Selective prevention modes running according to conditions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This list is not meant to be exhaustive in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NRL is interested in white papers that addresses both the entire IUHS or components of the IUHS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Collaboration and teaming between groups is encouraged to achieve the technical goals and manufacturing capability.</p>
<p>The IUHS Industry Day is scheduled to provide all interested with further information on the program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically:</p>
<p>An Industry Day will be held on Tuesday May 3, 2011 to provide additional information and discussion on this topic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Details and registration information may be found at https://secure.onr.navy.mil/events/regdetail.asp?cid=732 .</p>
<p>Attendance is voluntary and not required to respond to this RFI. Registration is required to attend the Industry Day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Time will be allowed during the industry day for potential offerors to interface with other interested commercial and academic parties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Time will be allowed during the industry day for one-on-one discussions with Navy technical representatives.</p>

Second Round of Questions and Answers for solicitation VA-241-11-RQ-0431
1.	Question: In the solicitation it requires one sample, does this mean one sample of each different custom pack, ie shoulder, ankle and so on, or just one pack?
Answer: In the solicitation, please refer to pages 6 & 7 for the complete list of Non-Sterile items requested.

2.	Question: For the list of items that you want in this pack, normally facilities want the items packaged in a certain sequence, but I see no sequencing listed. From that, can I assume that how the items are packaged within the sample will not be an area for evaluation?
Answer:  There is no sequencing requested. The only area for evaluation will be if vendors provide all items requested on pages 6 & 7.  Then as stated in the solicitation all vendors will be evaluated on price.	

3.	Question: Do you anticipate awarding this as an "all or nothing" award? Meaning will only one vendor be chosen?
Answer: In the solicitation, please refer to page 5 for the following sentence:  The Boston Veteran Affairs Medical Center is looking to award one Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract to one Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Company.  

4.	Question: Most of the components requested in the bill of materials, specifically for the surgical drapes and gowns manufactured by Cardinal Health are made in China. Would other drapes and gowns manufactured by other countries be acceptable?
Answer: Yes, brand name or equal is acceptable.

5.	Question: In the bill of material you provided for the non-sterile sample, you call for JELLY,LUBRICATING,5G,FOIL TEMP UNAVAIL THRU APRIL/2011, from TRIAD DISPOSABLES (emphasis added).  As you know, this is a recall item.
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/RecallsCorrectionsRemovals/ListofRecalls/ucm243399.htm  The "exact" item from TRIAD would not be used by us in this sample but a brand name or equal, per your clause at C.14 would be provided.  Is this satisfactory?
Answer: Yes, brand name or equal is acceptable.  

6.	Question: Cardinal Health will not sell NDL CNTR,40-70 COUNT,FOAM BLOCK W/MAGNET,NS to our manufacturer although other Cardinal products are available to purchase.  This may be a China manufactured product anyway.  We will include a brand name or equal per your clause at C.14.  Is this satisfactory?
Answer: Yes, brand name or equal is acceptable.

7.	Question: You use the term "exact" in several places throughout the solicitation but include the clause at C.14, VAAR 852.211-73.  Brand name or equal does not carry the same definition as "exact".  This would appear to be ambiguous and we would seek to know if the clause at C.14 supersedes all references to "exact".
Answer: Yes, the clause supersedes all references to "exact".

<DESC>AMENDMENT #4
PLEASE DISREGARD THE AMENDMENT #2 DATED MARCH 22, 2011 IN IT'S ENTIRETY

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

1. I have reviewed the Responses to Questions that you have issued for the project and noted that no response is provided to question #22 page 4.  Could this question be answered:
As indicated in the above message, please refer to Amendment #3 Question 22 and disregard Amendment #2 dated March 22, 2011.
 2. Since this is the first time we have seen the preference for all design work within a geographic area, we are wondering if this preference will become typical of VA projects in the Bay Area or even VA procurement in general?  
Each VA solicitation preference and evaluation factors will be announced in all VA solicitation on a case-by-case basis.  
 3. On the second page, under Scope-3rd paragraph it states "The contract will include options for: design development documents, construction documents, construction period services are for the "AE services during construction, not construction management services.  Am I correct?
Yes
 4. When this project goes to construction do you plan to solicit for construction management services? 
A decision to solicit for CM Services has not been determined at this time
 5. I'm still hoping you can clarify the small business requirements soon, as we try to finalize our team.  There is still some confusion regarding whether all small disadvantaged businesses must be Section 8(a) certified or if self certification will suffice.
Please refer to Amendment #3 Question #14 response published March 25, 2011s.  "Small Disadvantaged Business Section 8(a) - must be certified.
6.  Is there a list of interested Architects for this project?  
Please refer to the Solicitation in FedBizOps and click on the "Interested Vendors List" tab.
7. Would you please clarify if NAICS code 541990 is just as qualified as 541310 for this opportunity?

No

8. Under the "Management Plan" selection criteria, would you please clarify what is meant by "Personnel Change Control" and Firm's Partnering Plan"?

Personnel Change Control - Contractor's management of change in key personnel.

Firm's Partnering Plan -  A plan to establish a long term win-win relationship based on mutual trust and teamwork, and on sharing of both risks and rewards as it applies to a relationship between your firm and your clients.

9. Would you please clarify the subcontracting goals?  We understand that the VA would like to see us team with firms that meet the goal criteria, but since we are considered a small business, do the goal percentages count?  The RFQ states "If subcontracting opportunities exist and the submitting firm is not a small business, the small business subcontracting goals will be"

Yes, the VA encourages small businesses to strive to meet the small business goals for all socio-economic programs while considering the requirement that the prime small business would have to demonstrate that they can perform at least 51% of the total contract amount.

10. Shall design of fire alarm and sprinkler systems be independently engineered for bid, design-build, or performance spec only for contractor's proprietary design?
Design to include fire alarm and sprinkler systems.
11. Do blank pages count toward the 100 page limitation? (For example, the blank back side of a page with content.)

Double-sided page with the information on one side counts as one page.

12. Would you like the SF-330 package in a three (3) binder or can we use binding combs?

This decision is left to your discretion.

       THE FOLLOWING IS ADDED TO SUBJECT SOLICITATION:
The selected firm will be required to participate in a one (1) day pre-negotiation meeting at VA Central Office, Washington DC, prior to contract award.

<AWARDEE>TENCATE ADVANCED ARMOR USA, INC. (185068350) <br> 23 SISAL ST<br> NEWARK, OH 43055-5831
<DESC>Under this solicitation number, the Army Contracting Command (ACC) / Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) has awarded one firm-fixed-price contract for 6 material samples. AATD shall purchase representative samples of commercially available armor materials in current use by the United States Armed Services. The samples are desired to have a single-hit ballistic limit V50 velocity of 1950 feet per second (100m remaining velocity) against a 7.62 x 39mm Type PS Ball at the lowest possible areal density. It is anticipated that the lowest areal density will vary by material. The panels shall be constructed in multiple square geometries using optimized laminate material compositions. Each of the materials shall be fabricated in homogenous sample sets that optimize the areal density against the intended threat. It is anticipated that processing parameters shall vary with each type of material. In order to minimize variability, the processing conditions shall be kept constant regardless of panel geometry, per sample set, per material. No coverings or coatings are required to be applied to the panels, and the panels are to have finished/cut edges suitable to prevent delamination or other damage to the laminate quality. The panels shall be individually marked, denoting the material composition, panel size, and areal density. The provided samples shall have a square geometry for all panels with outer dimensions as identified below. The intent is to double the plane area of target size with each increasing target size (i.e., 64 in2, 128 in2 , 256 in2, etc.). Some allowance for these exact dimensions may be allowed to permit a more optimized manufacturing process. The geometric tolerance for all panels shall be   .125" from the specified dimensions. The 6 materials are as follows: Dyneema HB-50, Dyneema HB-80, Spectra Shield II SR-3130, Spectra Shield II SR-3137, Kevlar, and Tensylon. The following panel sizes apply: 6 each 8" x 8", 6 each 11.31" x 11.31", 6 each 16" x 16", 6 each 22.63" x 22.63", and 6 each 31" x 31". Six panels shall be supplied per panel size in each of the 6 different material compositions shown above, for a total of 36 panels per material composition, 180 panels overall. Shipping charges are included in the contract. All samples shall be packaged to ensure safe delivery to destination point. Delivery of the material samples is expected to be 6 months After Receipt of Order. Delivery, Inspection, Acceptance, and F.O.B Point shall be at Destination. Destination is the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, AATD Warehouse, Bldg 3519A, Mulberry Island Road, Attn: Ryan Harris, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577. The successful offeror shall submit their invoices through the Wide Area WorkFlow Web site http://wawf.eb.mil and is in good standing with the government according to the Excluded Parties List System https://www.epls.gov.  The evaluation factors were (1) technically acceptable, (2) low price, and (3) delivery. Technical acceptance provides for adherence to the requirement as identified above.

<DESC>The requirement is for non-personal professional and administrative support services for the National Museum of Health and Medicine (NMHM) in support of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).  The NMHM is a highly collaborative environment which comprises three integrated divisions, whose overall mission is the development, planning, analysis, management and implementation of all activities related to its holdings, their use, or any other activity related thereto.  The NMHM is the permanent steward of the nation's National Historic Landmark medical collection.  The NMHM is responsible for its cultivation and development and all activities related to its missions.  The contractor will support this mission by providing highly qualified, experienced personnel necessary to perform professional, scientific,  administrative support and courier services, seamlessly integrating current operations with transition-period and future operations.  Support includes a normal work day in addition to early, weekend, holiday, and occasional evening work, if required.  Travel to CONUS/OCONUS is required.  Through a BRAC directive, the NMHM will be relocating from the current museum location on the campus of Walter Reed Army Medical Center to existing structures located in Gaithersburg, MD and a new construction located in Forest Glen, MD.  The relocation of the NMHM entails a high degree of uncertainty and will at a minimum require increased contractor support and operations.  The period of performance is April 1, 2011 through September 15, 2011.  The Contracting Officer is Mr. Gary D. Hankins, (210) 221-3876, email gary.hankins@amedd.army.mil.  The Contract Specialist is Ms. Yesenia C. Rodriguez, (210) 221-5963, email yesenia.rodriguez1@amedd.army.mil.
