<DESC>Notice of intent to award purchase order for five (5) CORE IMPACTýýý machine licenses from Core Security Technologies, 41 Farnsworth Street, Boston, MA. CORE IMPACTýýý is proprietary to the creator in that it delivers automated penetration testing capability, as well as transparent pivoting.  This provides the user with the ability to perform pen tests in an automated step-by-step process and the technology allows users to transparently pivot into the network, shift their vantage point to any compromised machine with the click of a mouse, and then continues to test deeper into the network from that new vantage point.  No other company provides this exact type of technology capability. Access to this technology is considered mission-essential for these DOE users.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to award to only one source under the authority of FAR paragraph 13.501. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all expressions of interest received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government for the next acquisition of this type.  This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.

<DESC>The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) intends to issue a solicitation on December 14 for recurring technical assistance services in conducting Procurement System Reviews (PRS); an FTA area of program oversight.  The objective of the PSR is to examine how recipients of FTA funds comply with statutory and administrative requirements for procurement, particularly those that are included in the Annual Certifications and Assurances submitted by grantees.  The PSR aides the FTA in evaluating grantee effectiveness in carrying out project obligations under a grant agreement that is signed by FTA and the grantee after project approval.  The Procurement System Review examines 55 elements to determine if FTA grantees are meeting FTA procurement requirements and to identify corrective actions if a grantee is not meeting the requirements.  
 
FTA intends to award up to 4 multi-year contracts to Small Business concerns for PSR technical assistance oversight services.  The contracts will be hybrid in nature in that there are some fixed price contract line items and some Time and Materials contract line items.

Due to the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) and MDA internal re-engineering efforts to re-locate personnel that will affect the DOI Infrastructure and Environment Directorate requirement,  the Contracting Officer has determined that an interim sole source ?bridge? contract is in the best interest of the Government.   At present time, it is contemplated that the support services for DOI Infrastructure and Environment Directorate will be incorporated into the Agency?s proposed Missile Defense Agency Engineering and Support Services (MiDAESS) procurement.  The described procurement will ensure continuity of services until such time that these services can be procured competitively under the Missile Defense Agency Engineering and Support Services (MiDAESS) program. Companies are encouraged to monitor FedBizOpps announcements for any related future requirements.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, responses received by 9: 00 am eastern time, 18 December 2007 will be reviewed.  No formal solicitation package is available.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for planning purposes for a future competitive procurement.  The government will not be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this notice.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) webpage located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334515, 500 employee size standard.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) intends to procure on a competitive basis a shock and vibration test of M98 CBR Filter Set mounted in a fixture provided by NSWCDD.  The weight of the M98 CBR is about 4,050 pounds and it has a dimension of 63.875? x 60.875? x 69.438.  The following tests need to be performed to verify that the M98 CBR filter set meets the qualification for !  shipboard shock and vibration qualification: (a) MIL-S-901D for grade A, class A, Type 1, 9-nine (9) blow medium weight shock testing; (b) MIL-S-167-1 vibration testing through the frequency range of 4-50Hz in each of three (3) major axes.  The test laboratory must provide instrumentation to monitor the acceleration levels simultaneously at eight different locations on the test fixture.  The test fixture will be leak tested by the Government before and after each test.  No contractor support is needed aside from allowing time to conduct this testing (approximately 1-2 hours per test, with 3 tests being required).  Close coordination of the contractor?s testing schedule with the Government?s requirement for leak testing, is essential.  NSWCDD will supply a test fixture; however the testing laboratory will be responsible for fabrication of any adapter/mounting plates necessary for mounting the test fixture to both the shock and vibration testing devices.  The test laboratory !  must provide a test report within 30 days after completion of testing.   The test laboratory must acknowledge that they are aware of the size of the test fixture and that they have a method to mount this test fixture.  The bottom edges of the test fixture are unpainted for welding to the adapter/mounting plate.   All proposals submitted will be evaluated by the Government.  The evaluation factors consist of: technically acceptable, lowest price.  The requirement will include a base (1 series of tests) and two option periods for fiscal year 2008.  Each option period will consist of 1 series of tests.  Before an option is exercised, the contractor shall be notified by the Government at least 30 days in advanced. All items need to be delivered FOB Destination to the NSWCDD.  Provide an estimated delivery date or lead time on the quote. (How many days? Weeks?, Etc.)  The order shall be a firm fixed price purchase order.  Award is to be made under Simplified Procedures (FAR 13) by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, 17632 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5154.

Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

<DESC>EPA intends to award a sole source procurement to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The US EPA's Office of Air and Radiation, with sponsors also from NASA, NOAA, and NSF, require the services of NAS to conduct a study and develop a report that (1) summarizes the state of scientific understanding of the significance of the international transport of air pollutants into and out of the United States with respect to the achievement of environmental policy objectives related to air quality, pollutant deposition, and climate change; and (2) will be accepted as credible and unbiased by the scientific community, the executive and legislative branches of the US Government, state and local governments, private industry, and the public, and that can serve as the foundation for the development of U.S. domestic and foreign policies and US Government  funding priorities.   NAS, upon finalization of this action, will assemble an ad hoc panel of experts to address the charge questions.  The panel will be carefully chosen to contain the appropriate expertise and to avoid potential biases or conflicts of interest.  During the study, the panel collects information in open, public proceedings, but does not take direction from the study sponsors outside of the initial charge questions.  Upon completion of the expert panel's draft report, NAS management will review the report to ensure that the charge questions have been addressed and will conduct a scientific review to ensure that the conclusions are supported and represent the state of the scientific understanding.  The final independent report is then presented to the sponsors, Congress, and the public simultaneously.   NAS was congressionally chartered in 1863 to serve as an official, but independent, advisor to the United States government in the areas of science, engineering, and medicine.  The NAS is considered to be the definitive, unbiased voice of the scientific community in the United States.  It's uniqueness in this role stems not only from its congressional charter, but also from its reputation and from the manner in which it carries out its studies.  Executive Order 12832 recognizes the unique qualifications of the NAS and explicitly authorizes sole-source procurement when the government determines that NAS is the only source that can provide the necessary expertise, independence, objectivity, and audience acceptance.  Based on these criteria, the National Academy of Sciences is the only source that can meet our needs.   No Request for Proposal is available and this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of this notice to Karen Watson at watson.karen@epa.gov for consideration by the Agency.  Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether competition is obtainable.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the government, a contract will be placed with National Academy of Sciences.

The additional effort provided by PWC will conclude upon completion of the follow-on competition.  The solicitation for the follow-on competition can be located at  http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/ordsupport/index.htm Under EP05W001146, PWC supports EPA's Office of Research and Development's efforts in organizational change across administrative lines of business and Information Management and Technology.  PWC is currently the only responsible  source capable of performing these current AAS efforts because they are co-authors to both reports and initiatives:  the Administrative Efficiencies Project(AEP) and the Information Technology Improvement Project (ITIP).   Under this sole source modification, PWC will continue to consult with ORD  stakeholder representatives to improve and map business processes, develop implementation strategies for achieving organizational change, conduct business process reengineering, and provide overall program management support to the multiple, integrated efforts.

Recently, ORD launched 3 more LoBs  which require the support of updated analysis based on the original analysis.  PwC's support of this effort as well as the ITIP make them the only viable vendor at this time to continue providing efficient and effective consulting services in order to adhere to ORD's schedule.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), as lead trustee for the Pike Property Restoration Project, plans to re-establish tidal exchange to the abandoned oxbow by dredging 5,000 cubic yards of silt from the historic channel.The general location for this project is on the east bank of the Mispillion River which divides Kent and Sussex Counties. Sections of the Mispillion River were channelized in the 1930's and the project area includes one of the original meanders which were cut off from the channelized mainstem. The Pike Property consists of 38 acres and is located 10 miles east of Milford, Delaware.  This section of the river is tidal with tidal amplitude of approximately 4 feet. The oxbow channel has filled in over time because there is no tidal exchange.  The Service proposes to dredge (use a hydraulic dispersion dredge) a portion of oxbow channel to a depth below Mean Lower Low Water.  Selected mudflats will be also dredged to create fish rearing areas.  The channel must be dredged to produce a self-maintaining oxbow channel (i.e., a channel that is kept open by normal tidal exchange).  Permits specify that the material must be deposited in a thin layer (<0.3 feet in depth) across the marsh.  A specialized dredge is required that can maneuver in shallow water (2-3 feet deep) without getting stuck.  Due to the unique requirements called for in the permit, special equipment is needed to complete this job that cannot be acquired through any other contractors.  Aztec Development holds the patent on a special high-pressure dredge that is mounted with a nozzle that creates a fine slurry which can be propelled across a large area.  This method allows for accurately controlled thin layering of material.  The apparatus is moved by barge to the area and can maneuver in extremely shallow water.  The construction is must be completed prior to the spring fish spawning run. The Government contemplates a sole source award to Aztec Development. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement via e-mail Alina_Sadoveanu@fws.gov or call 703 358 2172. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, if interested parties are determined able to meet requirement, their offer will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

(d) Organization and office management as evidenced by management approach (management plan for this contract), and personnel roles in the organization.

5.  Past Performance:  Firms will be evaluated in past performance with respect to work quality, compliance with schedules, and cost control (with emphasis on projects addressed in Evaluation Factor 1).  Firms should include any letters of commendation or awards.

6.  Quality Control Program:  Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality control program used to ensure technical accuracy and discipline coordination of plans and specifications - list key personnel responsible.

7.  Firm location (provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract).

8.  Volume of Work:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by DOD within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.

9.

<DESC>Subject: Informational Briefing in Support of ISS Payloads for the SMEX AO On Wednesday, December 19, 2007, NASA will provide an informational telecon briefing on the International Space Station (ISS) external payload accommodation and integration capabilities.  The capabilities for installing and operating payloads on the Express Logistics Carriers (ELC) mounted on the ISS truss structure, the Japanese Experiment Module ("Kibo") Exposed Facility (EF), the European Space Agency (ESA) Columbus External Payload Facility (EPF), the U.S. Laboratory's Window Research Observation Facility (WORF), and the Japanese HII Transfer Vehicle (HTV) (launch vehicle) will be described. These ISS capabilities are relevant to the Small Explorer (SMEX) and Missions of Opportunity Announcement of Opportunity (AO), which solicits proposals for small Mission of Opportunity class experiments/payloads. The SMEX solicitation may be found on NSPIRES at http://nspires.nasaprs.com	 (select "Solicitations", then "Open  Solicitations", and then "NNH07ZDA0030" -see Amendment 2 for ISS-based payloads).  Proposals for ISS-based experiments are due on February 12, 2008. Technical interchange briefing charts and answers to questions provided at the telecon/meeting on December 19, 2007, will be posted later at the ISS Earth and Space Science site http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/nlab/platform.html  , along with answers to other questions from potential proposers and previously posted material referred to in the SMEX AO Amendment 2. Participation in the telecon briefing is not necessary in order to provide an ISS related proposal in response to the SMEX AO, but proposers may find the briefing beneficial.  The telecon briefing will begin at 9 a.m. Central Time on December 19, 2007, and will end at 12:00 noon for the briefing portion. A question and answer period is scheduled from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM for those who are interested in further discussion. The meeting will be held at the Gilruth Center, near the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.  The telecon briefing will provide information on the capabilities and operations of various ISS elements which can be used to mount observational and other external payloads, and on the ISS launch capabilities in the post-Shuttle era. There is no fee for participating in the technical interchange telecon, but all participants must pre-register by Tuesday, December 18, 1:00pm CST. To pre-register, please email your full name, affiliation, address, telephone number, fax number, email address, and U.S. citizenship information to: pdl.helpdesk@msfc.nasa.gov, and put "SMEX AO TIM Registration" in the Subject field of your email. The information being presented may be export controlled and ITAR sensitive; thus, all attendees must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents (hold green cards). Telecon access information and a meeting location map will be provided to pre-registered participants. Charts planned to be used at the telecon/meeting will be emailed to pre-registered participants by Tuesday, December 18, 5:00pm CST. Following the briefing, a version of the charts and notes from Q&As are planned to be posted at http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/nlab/platform.html   .

<DESC>Note: The previous announcement/notice on this subject published at www.fbo.gov 11/2006 (#CBP-IC-2007-1) with subsequent modifications is canceled and superseded by the notice that follows.

INTERMITTENT CONTRACTOR/SUBJECT-MATTER EXPERT (SME). Background: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates numerous international training and assistance programs in various countries throughout the world which address the entire range of customs and border control operations. To effectively implement these programs, CBP requires the services of skilled and knowledgeable individuals (i.e., contractors) on an intermittent (short-term) basis. Short-term or intermittent is defined as a single assignment for 180 calendar days or less. Intermittent Contractors (ICs) will be required to perform various tasks such as those associated with training, utilizing specialized equipment, or to provide professional and technical assistance in specific topical areas. The following is a delineation of the types of general services that ICs are expected to provide under their contracts, as required. A more specific description of services or tasks shall be identified and provided to the ICs upon selection and award of an order/contract. 
       
TRAINING: He/she may be required to present customs or border control training based on an existing CBP curriculum. The IC shall serve as a subject matter expert and/or presenter. Instruction may include, but is not limited to, the areas of narcotics interdiction, port security, customs investigative techniques, money laundering, intellectual property rights, control of weapons of mass destruction, commercial import/export operations, or customs valuation. In general, the topic and contents of the course will be established, in advance, with course material normally provided by CBP. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training to serve as an instructor in general and in specific areas of instruction.

COURSE DEVELOPER: The IC shall develop a set of course materials on a given topic for later presentation by either CBP personnel or in-country advisors, as required. Courses to be developed could be in any customs or border control-related areas such as those described for TRAINING above. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training in course development for one or more related areas.

ASSESSMENTS: The IC may conduct on-site assessments of customs administrations and other border control agencies located in foreign countries, as required. Assessments may be general in scope or geared to specific areas (e.g., control of weapons of mass destruction, assessment of aviation equipment assets or of aviation programs, intellectual property rights, etc.). Tasks could include such actions as physical border surveys, and broader surveys of the entire governmental enforcement system. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the necessary experience and skills to complete an authoritative and professional review of the specific agencies or programs, and to prepare summaries, analyses, recommendations, trip reports, and/or other written work product(s).

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: The IC may provide technical assistance in highly specialized areas such as legal reform, inspectional technology (high and low tech), port security, or specialized field operations. For example, in the area of legal reform, tasks may include the review of customs laws and regulations of a country, making recommendations for improvements, and/or providing technical assistance in the preparation of new laws and regulations that meet the needs of a specific country. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess specialized knowledge, experience, and background related to specific areas of expertise.

AUGMENTATION and REPLACEMENT: The IC may augment a technical team or temporarily replace a technical team member. As an additional team member, the IC will undertake general or specific tasks associated with various projects such as the development of an interagency taskforce or the review of personnel policies. As a replacement or fill-in, the IC may replace and assume the tasks of a technical team member who may be away from post for an extended period of time. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess the necessary knowledge, experience, and skills to serve as an additional team member, or replacement member.

TERMS and CONDITIONS: Most IC assignments will be less than 30 days, with adequate advance notice given prior to assignment/deployment. Some IC assignments may last up to 180 calendar days. It is not envisioned that an IC would be on duty more than 180 days in a calendar year. If an IC declines more than two assignments, he or she may be excluded from further consideration at the discretion of CBP. 

POSSIBLE DUTY LOCATIONS: ICs must be willing and able to work in any country in which CBP conducts operations. CBP training and assistance projects are currently ongoing in all regions of the world.

COMPENSATION and OTHER REIMBURSEMENTS: 1) ICs will be compensated for their performance on a fixed-priced basis at the rate of $2,400.00 per week for all ICs or prorating thereof (i.e., $480.00/day, $60.00/hour), for the period of time estimated by CBP for completion of the assignment, excluding travel days. 2) All authorized hours worked will be paid at the above hourly rate. 3) There are no provisions for an overtime or premium rate. Work is generally to be performed during the normal workweek however, the Contractor may work on weekends and be compensated at normal hourly rate (i.e., $60.00) with the express authorization of the Contracting Officer and/or Program Manager. 
 
OTHER REQUIREMENTS: 1) Prospective ICs may be required to undergo updated background investigations to obtain a SECRET security clearance from CBP. If for some reason a clearance cannot be granted, the prospective IC may be excluded from consideration from any assignments calling for such clearances. 2) For some specific assignments, foreign language ability may be a requirement for selection. 3) All materials provided to or developed by the IC under a contract are the property of CBP, may not be released to any other party without express permission from CBP, and are subject to return to CBP upon conclusion of the contract (or sooner upon receipt of a request from CBP).

TRAVEL: All travel will be under U.S. Government travel orders (separate and apart from the contract) and in accordance with applicable U.S. Government travel regulations. ICs will be reimbursed for all official travel upon completion of a travel voucher in accordance with an approved travel authorization. The IC will be responsible for purchasing airline or other common carrier tickets subsequent to approval of travel. ICs are not authorized to receive an advance for expenses for lodging, meals and/or travel incidentals. The embassy will be making travel arrangements in country. Travel time to and from the United States is not compensable for pay purposes. 

CONSIDERATION of APPLICANTS: Both individuals and organizations are welcome to apply. Applications are to be submitted on an individual basis (one for each proposed IC applicant/person). Interested parties are to submit their qualifications in resume format, to be accompanied by a completed CBP - QUESTIONNAIRE FOR INTERMITTENT CONTRACTOR available at FedBizOpps (accompanies this Notice). Beginning with the date of this notice, all applicants must submit the most recent revision of the questionnaire (currently Rev 8-07) in order to be considered.

In order to ensure that full consideration is given, applicants are encouraged to review the form OF-612, available at    http://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/of612.pdf. A copy of the 6/2006 version available at the above website at the time this notice was published is also available at FedBizOpps. Applicants are encouraged to review the information and topics covered on the OF-612 form and ensure that their resumes contain the same data elements that appear in that form. Applicants should NOT use the form OF-612 for the purpose of submitting an application, however.

Resume packages (i.e., resume & completed questionnaire) will be accepted by e-mail only. 

INTERESTED APPLICANTS ARE TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATIONS AND RELATING DOCUMENTS TO: 

CBPIC@cbp.dhs.gov. 

DO NOT SUBMIT TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICE STAFF. A representative of the designated receiving office will acknowledge receipt of applications via email within 5 business days of receipt. If no acknowledgement is received within 5 business days after transmitting, applicants are encouraged to follow up by sending an email inquiry to the email address above to ensure receipt of their applications. 

NOTE: Applicants who applied under a previous notice/announcement are encouraged to submit new application packages in accordance with the guidance and requirements herein, to include a completed questionnaire.

METHOD of SELECTION/OPERATION, INSURANCE and PHYSICAL EXAM REQUIREMENTS: The CBP Office of International Affairs will evaluate the resume and questionnaire packages received for technical ability. CBP may exclude any applicant from consideration if it is unable to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of his/her qualifications from the documents submitted. Qualified and otherwise acceptable candidates will then be added to a Qualified Bidders List from which ICs are selected and may be awarded an order/contract for one or more assignments in the future as needs arise. Prospective ICs must be physically fit, able to perform the duties of an assignment and may be required to obtain a physical examination and certification that they are fit for travel anywhere in the world for assignments up to 180 calendar days. If selected for a contract award and CBP elects to require that the prospective IC obtain a physical, CBP will reimburse the IC for reasonable actual costs (not to exceed $500.00) by including this item on the order/contract, as described above. 

ICs are required to obtain emergency evacuation insurance coverage. The order/contract document will provide for reimbursement of reasonable actual costs for this coverage (not to exceed $500.00). In situations where an IC currently has emergency evacuation insurance coverage in place which will extend through the period of proposed performance, new coverage need not be obtained. In such cases, the IC must present written proof of coverage to the officer making the inquiry as to availability before an order will be placed.

REQUIRED REGISTRATION @ WWW.CCR.GOV: Prospective ICs must be registered in the government CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR) system at www.ccr.gov prior to issuance of an order/contract. CBP strongly recommends that applicants complete their registration as soon as possible after submitting an application. The process involves input of business information and registration with Dun and Bradstreet to obtain a D&B number. Applicants must include their D&B/DUNs # on the questionnaire (see above). 

ORDER/CONTRACT DOCUMENT: Once CBP identifies a requirement and selects a prospective IC, a CBP officer will contact the applicant and inquire as to availability for an assignment. If the selected applicant is available, a CBP Contracting Officer will prepare a suitable order/contract document in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (i.e., FAR, viewable at   http://www.acqnet.gov/far/). The contract will be in the form of a Labor Hours type contract awarded in accordance with FAR 16.6 and the document will contain the detailed statement of work for the specific assignment, including services required, estimated time required, country/destination, travel dates, materials and topics to be addressed, and other applicable information. 

ORDER ISSUANCE, COMMENCEMENT OF PERFORMANCE, ORDER CEILING: Applicants selected for an assignment and contract are not to commence performance or initiate travel until they receive and accept an order/contract in writing. The duration of contract performance shown on the contract document and resulting dollar amount constitutes a ceiling, beyond which the IC performs at his/her own risk. If needs arise which call for the IC to provide services for an additional period of time, the Contracting Officer will issue a modification which provides authorization for continued performance within specified limits. 

ORDER/CONTRACT INVOICING and PAYMENTS: Payments are processed by CBP in arrears, in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act as implemented by FAR clause 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, with its Alternate 1.  ICs are to submit an invoice for services rendered under their contract no more frequently than once per month (in arrears), unless otherwise specifically authorized in the order/contract document. It is suggested that ICs submit their monthly invoice during the first week of each calendar month for services performed during the previous calendar month. IC monthly invoices must comply with the requirements of FAR 32.905. Travel-related reimbursements are handled separately in accordance with applicable travel regulations as indicated in the text above.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS: All taxes (federal, state and/or local) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) income reporting requirements are the responsibility of the IC as a 1099 type vendor.

<SOLNBR>M6785408R8031
<CONTACT>Sandi Brubaker sandi.brubaker@usmc.mil
<DESC>The government intends to competitively award a firm fixed price contract under a small business set aside for the improvement of a nine mile stretch of road from Camp Wilson to the Range 220 complex via the Gypsum Ridge Training Area at MCAGTFTC Twentynine Palms, CA. The road experiences heavy traffic from contractor and service vehicles due to construction of the CAMOUT, which is expected to continue for the next three years minimally.  This road requires constant maintenance in the form of watering and re-grading, without which the road quickly degrades to the point of unserviceability.  Since the Combat Center is unable to meet the heavy maintenance tempo of this road additional service is required.  Once construction of the CAMOUT is complete, tactical vehicle traffic from Camp Wilson to the CAMOUT facility is expected to be heavy for years to come. The contractor shall furnish the necessary services, supplies, and application of Soil-Sement? to the base at MCAGTFTC Twentynine Palms, California.   The attached Draft Statement of Work provides more detailed information about the project.  A final RFP will be forthcoming and will be posted on NECO.  Any information provided to the Government will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.  Written response is requested within 15 days after publication of this notice.  This announcement does not constitute a commitment of the Government to issue a contract for this effort.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of satisfying the specific agency requirements identified herein that may be procured in the near future. This market research is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind. Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for the proposed requirements. Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Government and/or released to the public. The Government is primarily focused on seeking suitable commercial and non-developmental items or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements. If no such commercial/non-developmental items currently exist, the Government may entertain the procurement !  of developmental items based on the information received as a result of this market research. Information on capable sources are sought for the follow requirements:  System Description/Overview: System described in this RFI is a tactical sensor system for use by small fighting units.  The description of the sensor system reflects objective configuration. This sensor network will be utilized at the Platoon, (36 personnel), Squad (12 personnel), Fire Team (4 personnel) or smaller (2 personnel) level.  Due to the extremely limited logistics capability of the platoon and smaller units, emphasis must be placed on smaller size, lighter weight, rapid deployment, and efficient power consumption.  Small units that will be using this device are Infantry Marines in defensive positions and some offensive positions such as sniper hides and ambush sites. Use of this sensor system is intended to aid them in their primary responsibility, not become their primary responsibility.  Therefore, simplicity of operation is crucial.  This sensor system should be effective in the following scenarios: Fire Team and below: - Detection of personnel entering a building through sensor coverage of doorways, stairwells, hallways or other interior avenues of approach. - Detection of personnel entering a small exterior area (either urban, wooded, vegetated) being secured by the team Squad sized Units: - Detection of personnel entering a building through sensor coverage of doorways, stairwells, hallways or other interior avenues of approach. - Detection of personnel entering an exterior area (either urban, wooded, vegetated) being secured by the squad such as a city block or squad defensive position. Platoon sized units: - Detection of personnel entering a building or multiple buildings through sensor coverage of doorways, stairwells, hallways or other interior and exterior avenues of approach. -Detection of personnel entering an exterior area (either urban, wooded, vegetated) being secured by the platoon such as multiple city blocks, platoon defensive positions or company-level Forward Operating Bases (FOBs). Modularity and scalability in addition to small size, low weight and simplicity of operation will enable the sensor system to be effective in the range of different scenarios encountered by 2-man team up to a 36 man teams.  For example, a two man team on a 48 hour mission may bring 3 motion sensors and the control station to cover the entrances to the building they will occupy.  A platoon may need a dozen motion sensors, several cameras, and multiple control stations to cover all avenues of approach over a city block.   The exact configuration and number/type of sensors deployed changes as the size and mission of the unit changes.   The total system delivered will include enough communication nodes, sensors and operator control stations to be configured for the range of missions encountered by team through platoon sized units. Components and Functionality:  Basic graphic depiction of system is available upon request.  The configuration of the sensor system should consist of the following components: 1)	Network 2)	Control Station with software 3)	Communication Box (at the sensor) 4)	Sensors Network ? The robustness, functionality and simplicity of the sensor network is of primary interest.  Requirements for the network are as follows: 1)	Self forming and self healing.  Sensor nodes in the network shall be automatically recognized and controlled by the operator control station upon being turned on or coming into network range with minimal or no operator tasks. 2)	Sensor Nodes in the network shall have the ability to communicate directly with the operator control station or indirectly via other nodes in the network.  This means that each sensor node will not only transmit its own sensor data, but also retransmit the data of other nodes if other nodes are out of range of the control unit.   3)	Network will automatically select the best transmission path from sensor node to operator control station and from operator control station to sensor node. 4)	Network will be capable of monitoring all sensor nodes at the same time. Operator Control Station - Requirements for the operator control station box are as follows: 1)	The control station will utilize a common operating system capable of operation on a variety of user interfaces.   2)	User interface will be laptop computer, PDA and/or similar Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) device.  Multiple Operator Control Stations to cater to the range of platoon and team missions are acceptable.  For example, a PDA can be provided for team missions while a laptop computer can be provided for platoon missions.   3)	An external communications device wired to the COTS operator control station is acceptable.  Operator Control Station utilizing the same communications box as the Sensor Nodes is preferable.  4)	Software will be capable of displaying real-time video and data sensor output simultaneously.   Software shall include, or will be capable of integration with, digital map data in order to provide a visual depiction of sensor locations.  5)	Ability to monitor sensor network from multiple control stations simultaneously is preferable.  Communications Box - Each sensor will require a communications box to transmit sensor data from the sensor to the control station and transmit command data from the control station to the sensor.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
MEDICARE CURRENT BENEFICIARY SURVEY (MCBS)
SURVEY DATA VALIDATION, DATA ANALYSIS, DATA DISSEMINATION, EDUCATION, AND OUTREACH
General Information:
This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential of service-disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB), and HUBZone small business, to provide the required services for The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).  Although it is our intent to find SDVOSB or HUBZone businesses other Small Businesses that meet the requirements may also respond. 
The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541720,541712.  This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  
This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only.  
Project Background:
The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) is a national ongoing, multi-purpose, face-to-face survey of a representative sample of the Medicare population.  The survey was first fielded in September of 1991 and has remained continuously fielded, without interruption to the data collection since its first fielding.  The MCBS is sponsored by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  

The MCBS is a longitudinal rotating panel survey.  Each year a new panel of approximately 6,000 survey participants is added to the survey and one panel is retired.  Sample persons are interviewed three times each year over a four year period using the Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing methodology.  These surveys form a continuous profile of each individual's personal health care experience.  The MCBS is thus uniquely capable of tracking changes in coverage and other personal circumstances, and observing processes that occur over time, such as people leaving their homes and taking up residence in long-term care facilities, or spending down their assets for medical care until they become eligible for Medicaid.

Respondents for the MCBS are sampled from the Medicare enrollment file to be representative of the Medicare population as a whole.  The sample size was designed to yield about 12,000 completed cases annually.  The sample was drawn from 107 primary sampling units (PSUs) or major geographic areas chosen to represent the nation, including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, with a second stage of 1,163 geographic clusters defined by ZIP Code initially drawn within those PSUs.  

The purpose of this action is to assess the capability of a Contractor:  to validate - in a scientifically sound method - each new round of MCBS data; to document this validation process through the production and dissemination of reports to CMS and/or its Designees; to provide education and outreach to MCBS data users; to provide technical assistance to data users; and to conduct applied research in support of the MCBS program and current CMS program goals and objectives.

<SUBJECT>65 -- IV Pump and Needleless IV Pump Tubing
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-N002597339SS01
<RESPDATE>122607
<ARCHDATE>01102008
<CONTACT>Cindy Ingrao, Clinical Consultant, Phone 619-532-8517, Fax 619-532-5439, Email cingrao@nmcsd.med.navy.mil
<DESC>A.General Information
TRICARE Southwest Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army,     Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities in California announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of IV Pumps & Needleless IV Pump Tubing with a possible multi-vendor selection. (A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.) In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTF's needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability.
The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.   

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

1.The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated line item volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated selection date is February 2008.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  As the evaluation results become more technically equal, price may become more important.

TRBO Point of Contact:
Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN at (619) 532-8517; Email- cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil

B.Products & Performance Required

The Southwest Region is seeking product line items in the category of for IV Pumps & Needleless IV Pump Tubing. The product category includes single and multi-channel general infusion pumps and tubing (administration sets) for the same infusion pumps that use needleless technology for use in the acute care setting on adult, pediatric and neonatal patients.

The estimated total volume in our Region for the consumables is over $600,000 annually.

At the request of the Southwest Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.

C.Instructions to Vendors

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address), and (3) your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and product literature to cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil no later than December 26, 2007. Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  If your product literature is more than 4MB in size, please mail your product literature to:

Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN 
Tri-Service Regional Business Office 
MSMMO - Southwest Region 
34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 
San Diego, CA  92134 
Phone:  (619) 532-8517

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its response and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D. Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within the Southwest Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Not Acceptable, 2 = Minimally Acceptable, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Acceptable, and 5 = Highly Acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the ?break?, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

2.Phase III ? All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit
best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of pricing offers to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.  

1. Technical Criteria Evaluation

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

1.Vendors must provide IV Infusion Pumps and Needleless IV Pump Tubing for use with adult, pediatric and neonatal patients. At a minimum, the following items are required:  Single and Multi-channel general infusion pumps; 20 Drop Check Valve with 2 Needleless Valve Ports; Vented/Unvented Check Valve Set with 3 Needleless Valve Ports; Non-Vented Blood Set, 20 Drop with 200 micron filter; and Burette Injection with 3 Needleless Ports. Vendors must provide a list of the products they supply in this product line and the brand name.
2.Vendors must have a separate agreement with the Prime Vendor supporting our Region, Cardinal Health or will be disqualified.
3.Vendors must have a DAPA number or is in the process of obtaining a DAPA or will be disqualified.
4.Your product line must be latex free and this must be indicated on the packaging of the product.
5.Vendors must provide product literature for this product line.
6.Vendors must provide 24/7 customer support and identify company resources for such support with their initial submittals.
7.Vendors must submit prices lower than their DAPA or will be disqualified. 
8.Your products must meet the FDA requirements for medical devices.
9.Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic excel format upon request.
10.Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls/alerts that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the IV Infusion Pumps and Needleless IV Pump Tubing including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals.  This represents your sole opportunity to present this information. Provide any mitigating factors that you may have in order to provide a proper context for the cited back orders, recalls, etc.
11.In order to confirm and refine market research, please provide your company status for the required product line (manufacturer/distributor) and size status (large business/small business).

2. Clinical/Performance Criteria Evaluation

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability. The clinical/performance criteria outlined below are equally weighted. The CPT has established

Newborn Screening Translational Research Network Coordinating Center Description

Background:
The Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Branch (MRDD) within the Center for Developmental Biology and Perinatal Medicine (CDBPM) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested in identifying any organization with the requisite capabilities to develop and maintain a Coordinating Center that will establish the research infrastructure for a Newborn Screening Translational Research Network (NBSTRN). 

Newborn screening is currently used to identify afflicted infants prior to presentation of clinical symptoms of disease. It is the most common form of population-based genetic testing, screening 4 million newborn infants annually in the United States. Recently there has been a rapid expansion of the number of conditions included in state newborn screening panels however, evidenced-based research to support the inclusion of these candidate conditions is lacking.  Specifically there is a need to understand the natural history of these candidate conditions, explore technological capabilities of screening assays, and develop therapeutic interventions for these conditions. 

Newborn screening is considered a coordinated and comprehensive system that includes education, screening, follow-up, diagnosis, management and program evaluation.  This public health program is under the auspice of each state, thus newborn screening policy is decided at the state level.  There are limited federal policies on newborn screening.  Since policies are made at the state level, there is wide state-to-state variability on which disorders are included on state newborn screening panels.  

The standard for states in determining which conditions to screen for has largely remained unchanged since 1968. In general, the conditions screened for should be an important health problem, with an acceptable and accessible treatment, the natural history of the condition should be known and there should be a suitable test that?s acceptable to the population and is appropriately sensitive and specific.  Many of the conditions currently screened for do not fulfill all the criteria and decisions have been made based on other factors. Decisions about which tests to use in newborn screening programs often have been made in an extemporaneous fashion, depending on recommendations from professional groups, patient advocates, state legislators, and newborn screening programs.  

There is a tremendous need for surveillance and research to provide the evidence needed for state-level decisions and to develop nationally recognized standards.  In order to execute this type of research responsibly a comprehensive research infrastructure is needed.  Currently no such research infrastructure exists, so therefore, the NICHD proposes to establish a research infrastructure for a Newborn Screening Translational Research Network (NBSTRN). 

Objective: 
The primary purposes of the NBSTRN Coordinating Center is to provide an infrastructure for research that facilitates the development of new screening methods, clinical trials for new therapeutic interventions and support longitudinal research to study the long-term health of children identified through newborn screening.  The NBSTRN Coordinating Center is the first and critical element for development and implementation of the NBSTRN.  This center will be responsible for the coordination of all research protocols, the development of the informatics system and virtual repository of residual dried bloodspots, the management of a steering committee, and the standardization of necessary informed consent policies and practices. Planning for the development of the network?s infrastructure will occur during the first three years of the contract, including development of the informatics component and protocol development.  

The Coordinating Center is intended to support the following goals of the NBSTRN:

1)  Address the needs of biomedical investigators across the country to effectively share and have access to dried bloodspots and other samples including possibly enrolled patients in a site-independent manner for research. 
 
2)  Facilitate evaluating the predictive value of biomarkers through early phase clinical/epidemiological studies.

3)  Encourage collaboration and rapid dissemination of information to ensure progress and avoid fragmentation of effort.

4)  Facilitate research on the development of new methods and technologies.

5)  Facilitate research on screened and treated patients to define effectiveness of treatments and long-term outcomes.

Requirements:

To be deemed capable of developing and maintaining the NBSTRN Coordinating Center the offeror must submit a written capability statement that clearly demonstrates their experience and ability to:

1)	Develop laboratory and practice standards guidelines related to newborn screening.
2)	Provide expert professional leadership in the laboratory and clinical diagnosis of conditions included in newborn screening.
3)	Develop and provide access to residual dried bloodspots comprising of those stored by State newborn screening programs and/or other repositories.
4)	Develop an informatics and communications system to link researchers to potential human subjects for clinical trials, follow up and other research issues and activities.
5)	Develop recommendations for model informed consent and research policies appropriate to newborn screening.
6)	Function productively as an organized and established center of state newborn screening programs and clinical centers to validate screening technologies and therapeutic interventions. 

AT THIS TIME THE NICHD IS REQUESTING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM ALL QUALIFIED BUSINESSES.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.   The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement would be 541711.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY:  DEEP TARGET DETECTION (MUNITION BASED TARGETS AND AT MINES).  The U.S. Army CECOM Life Cycle Management Command (LCMC) Acquisition Center-Washington (CACW) on behalf of the U.S. Army RDECOM, CERDEC, Night Vision and Electronic Sensors  Directorate (NVESD), Countermine Division, Ground Vehicle Applications Branch is conducting market research to identify companies having technology, qualifications and capabilities to demonstrate a ground vehicle mounted, high performance ground penetrati ng radar (GPR) to detect both shallow and deeply buried in-road (under-belly attack) munitions based targets and antitank (AT) landmines.  The specific objective of the market research is to identify companies which have both a mature shallow (less than 12 ) close-in (down-looking) GPR system and the capability to rapidly mature such a GPR system to detect more deeply buried AT mines and munitions based targets (up to 36).  Maturity for this market research is defined as a minimum GPR technology readiness level (TRL) of 6 in a relevant AT mine, and munitions based target detection environment.  The GPR must have high real time detection performance for both deeply buried and shallow buried targets.  The system must have a real time operator interface which requires little direct operator involvement.  The Government may use results of this market research to formulate a near term program that integrates GPR technology onto a U.S. Army ground vehicle.  This future program may include the following Performance  Objectives: detection of munitions based targets and AT mines on primary and secondary roads with a high probability of detection ( greater than or equal to 0.90), and a low false alarm rate (less than or equal to 0.001 per square meter), with detection s peeds up to 30 kilometers per hour; and the following Technical Objectives:  (a) Integration of an existing or modified (if needed) prototype detection system with a manned Army ground vehicle (b) Limited contractor performance and environmental testing of  the prototype detection system to verify satisfaction of the performance objectives; and (c) Integration of a Government-furnished metal detector to provide an integrated sensor suite capable of detection of the full range of threats (shallow buried, deep ly buried, high and low metal content, and non-metallic).  This is NOT a request for proposal.  Companies who desire to participate in this market research are encouraged to submit a white paper which supports the companys claim that it presently has the technology, qualifications and capabilities to satisfy the performance and technical objectives described above.  The white paper should discuss the companys specific down-looking GPR system and relevant performance test results, documentation supporting a maturity level of TRL 6 or higher or the companys approach to maturing the companys GPR technology to TRL 6 or higher within 18 months.  The white paper should also discuss related company experience and include point(s) of contact.  The white paper sh ould be prepared in MS Word, limited to ten (10) pages, and submitted electronically to the CACW Contract Specialist, Tina Patterson, at tristina.patterson@us.army.mil by 14 January 2008. If submission cannot be made via email, the package may be mailed to  US Army CECOM Acquisition Center  Washington, 2461 Eisenhower Ave, Room 1126, Attn: AMSEL-AC-WA (Ms. Tina Patterson), Alexandria, VA 22331-0700. The Government will consider all responses submitted on time.  The Government will not reimburse interested s ources or responders for any costs incurred responding to this request or for subsequent exchanges of information. Any proprietary information submitted should be marked accordingly and will be protected when clearly identified as proprietary. All requests  for further information must be made in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>J -- Canon Copier Maintenance
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is using simplified acquisition procedures to acquire Canon copier maintenance services using the authority of the Patent & Trademark Regulations (PTAG). PTAG Regulation is accessible at http:www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/compt/proc/acquproc.htm. 

Specifically, these services will be procured using procedures similar to Simplified Acquisition Procedures and there will be a predetermined number of offerors in competitive range?three. If discussions are held, negotiations will allow for flexibility and we reserve the right to negotiate only with the highest rated offeror. 

The USPTO anticipates issuing a FFP Contract and the contract we issue may include unpriced options for future years. 

The USPTO's objective is to maintain 193 cannon copiers in proper working condition. Offerors should indicate what their maintenance plans are to meet the requirement but the minimum requirements are 4 hours onsite response time, the business must be a current canon authorized dealer and the technician(s) must be current canon certified technicians, and use only genuine Canon parts and supplies. The agreement will not include toner, paper, or staples. 

This is a best--value procurement. The evaluation factors are experience, response time, past performance, and price. Experience should be from similar projects that have been performed within the last five years. Experience information should contain the following details: agency or business, number of machines, brand name of copiers maintained, and the period of performance. 

First send in only company information, experience, and proof of company?s status as Canon authorized dealer and certification of technicians.  Deadline to send in company information, experience information, and company and technician status is Tuesday December 11, 2007 by 2:00 pm eastern standard time. 

The company information and experience should be no more than 5 pages. The three vendors considered to have the most relevant experience will be selected at that time for the competitive range. 

The contractors in the competitive range shall submit 3 past performance references, response time and pricing information. The USPTO will evaluate the information and rank the offerors. The USPTO reserves the right to enter into negotiation with the highest rated offeror only. If an agreement with the highest rated offeror cannot be reached the government will begin negotiations with the second highest rated offeror, and so on. 

Past performance information shall contain company name, contact name, phone number, and email address. 

Price should take into consideration, machine age, regular maintenance scheduling, all parts and labor for major repairs, all maintenance supplies needed other than toner. Price shall be expressed as an agregate figure for one year. Machines model numbers beginning with NP are analog. Analog copiers are 8 to 9 years old. Copier model numbers beginning with ?IR? are digital. The average age is 3 to 4 years old. 

The USPTO is doing 85,000,000 copies per year including overages. 189 copiers are located at the USPTO campus in Alexandria Virginia but 4 copiers are located in Boyers Pennsylvania. 



Documentation

Response time/past performance shall be no more than 1 page.  Price shall be no more than two pages. The pricing page shall contain all assumptions that led to the pricing decision.

If the offeror?s proposal is contrary to the stated requirements via its terms and conditions or other parts of its offer, it may be rejected and receive no further consideration.

Any technition from the successful offeror must be able to pass a security screening inorder to obtain a badge that allows sufficient clearance to access copiers in all locations in the facilities.

Debriefing

All information requests regarding award details will be handled pursuant to FAR 13.106(d).

The building is accessible by the #93 Ride-On shuttle from the Red Line Twinbrook station.     In good weather, the walk is less than 15 minutes and the building can be seen from the station.     Taxis are available at the Metro station.     Should you drive, limited visitor parking is located at the end of Fishers Lane on the left, and charges an hourly fee payable in cash only.     

The building is accessed by visitors only from the Fishers Lane entrance and requires clearance through Security.     You will present a photo ID to check in, and receive a temporary building badge for the meeting.     You will be escorted from the front lobby to the conference room for the duration of the meeting.     You will be escorted back to the lobby area at the conclusion of the meeting.     During the meeting, you will not be permitted access to areas outside of the third floor PSC Conference Center.     

To access the building, your personal briefcases, bags, and purses will be screened by x-ray machines.

You will be asked to walk through a metal detector to enter the building.     We suggest you place automobile keys, cell phones, large amounts of change, and other largely metallic personal materials in your briefcase or purse to be scanned.     This will expedite your clearing the scanner.     Please do not wear any large metal belts, buckles, clothing with large metallic adornments, or footwear with metal plates or shanks.     If you have metal implants or medical devices, please let the security personnel know this before you enter the scanner. 

Response to the meeting has been brisk, so space in the conference room will be at a premium.     Please do not bring extra baggage or clothing that will not neatly roll or fold and fit under your seat during the meeting.

<SUBJECT>D -- Online Procurement Services - Reverse Auction Survey for Participating Vendors
<DESC>Invitation to participate in the Online Procurement      Services study on reverse auctions.

On October 4, 2006 the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) initiated a review of the use of commercially available online procurement services (OPS), including reverse auctions.  

This notice is an invitation to any and all contractors that have participated in reverse auctions; or have chosen not to participate, but are interested in improving the process.

The following link will take you to the participating vender survey.  In this case the term users includes firms that may not have participated in a reverse auction, but are interested in providing constructive feedback regarding their use.  


http://www.dau.mil/performance_support/mdcsurvey/vendor/vendor.htm






   Instructions:  To register to complete the survey you will need to provide a single DUNS number specific to your firm.  Also, please assign your most knowledgeable company representative to complete the survey since we will select only one response per DUNS number.

The OPS working group tested the survey and believe it should take no more than 10 minutes for each company to complete.  Your participation in this study is strictly voluntary and anonymous.  

This survey is only a request for information and the government does not plan to issue procurements from this effort.  Further, the government does not in any way bear any cost or liability associated with your firm's participation.
 
The survey will be available from Monday, December 10, 2007, beginning at 9:00 am through Friday, December 21, 2007, closing at 5:00 pm.

After the data have been analyzed we will provide the initial draft for public comment.  Thank you for support of this effort.

Point of contact is A1C Joseph Hoh, Contract Specialist, telephone 707-424-7773 SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 1. Requiring Activity: 60MDSS/SGSLB-3 MERC 2. Contracting Agency: 60th Contracting Squadron, Travis AFB CA. Purchase Request #: F3Z4537261AQ01 4. Description of Requirement: Service request for PM, Calibration, and repair including full AQ overage for parts and labor, of the Roche MagNa Pure LC DNA Purification/Analyzer; S/N LPCG0571. 5. Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition: Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by: FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. 6. Justification or authority for action: A. This request is for the PM, Calibration and repair of a Roche MagNa Pure LC DNA Purification/Analyzer to full operational status. Roche Diagnostics, which is the original manufacturer of the analyzer, is the only known source for the requested service. B. Roche diagnostics is the original manufacturer and the only company that does the maintenance on this type of analyzer, therefore it is the only source that knows the units functional capabilities and maintenance whether it has a malfunctions or if it requires part replacements. C. This machine is currently down due to an error code and it?s a work stoppage. It is very critical because this equipment is required to process specimen samples for DOD research studies performed at the David Grant Medical Center Clinical Investigation Facility (CIF). Since they are the original Manufacturer, they are the only ones that have the right test equipments to do the maintenance on the unit. D. The unit is used for specimens that are tissue and bacterial samples which have a critical shelf life, so they must be tested promptly before they degrade. Therefore it is imperative that arrangements for a Roche service engineer be made urgently to return this unit to service. Delaying this repair will negatively affect the ongoing DOD research capabilities of the CIF. Furthermore more delaying this scheduled maintenance may result in more costly repairs and/or incorrect test results effecting ongoing research. 7. Market Research/ Other Facts: No other manufacturer of DNA analyzers or third party vendor could be located to service the MagNa Pure LC DNA Analyzer at this time. All repair parts are Roche Diagnostic proprietary items that are only available to service engineers employed by Roche Diagnostic Corporation. 8. Sole source company: Roche Diagnostics Corporation 800-526-1247 hotline 9. Steps to improve competition: Biomedical Engineering continues to evaluate other companies to meet parts/repair requirement. Currently, Roche Diagnostics is the only company that can perform repairs to this machine. //SIGNED// KRISTOFFER DERRICK L. CHUA, SRA, USAF Biomedical Equipment Repair Team 1, NCOIC

<SUBJECT>81 -- FPI Production of Containers - FSC codes 8140 and 8145
<DESC>In furtherance of the FPI Board of Directors? directive to pursue the creation of inmate jobs without reliance on mandatory source, a notice was published in the December 21, 1998 edition of the Commerce Business Daily (CBD) regarding FPI?s production of products for the Federal government on a competitive (non-mandatory) basis.  The notice stated that the Board of Directors had granted approval for FPI to competitively bid on products for which it did not rely on its mandatory source of supply.  Under this procedure, FPI would not follow the public involvement guidelines process established by 18 U.S.C. 4122(b) which is required for new products FPI offers as a mandatory source.  FPI is required to publish a notice of its intentions to competitively produce a product purchased by the Federal government.  

This notice announces FPI?s intentions to produce shipping and storage containers on a competitive basis and not use its mandatory source status.  These products encompass all shipping and storage containers in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 8140 - Ammunition and Nuclear Ordnance Boxes, Packages and Special Containers, and FSC 8145 - Specialized Shipping and Storage Containers.    

Once a product is sold competitively by FPI, it remains a competitive product and will never be added to FPI?s Schedule of Products as a mandatory source product.  FPI will not attempt to exercise its mandatory source at some future point in time nor seek from its Board of Directors to expand production of the product by invoking the guidelines process at some later date.  It has been previously determined by the FPI Board of Directors that whatever share of the market FPI acquires on a competitive basis will be deemed to be a reasonable share of the market within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 4122(b)(2).  Sales of products manufactured under this procedure will be tracked and recorded separately by FPI as is the case for subcontracting and services.

Interested parties have a right to comment or raise questions with FPI?s Board of Directors.  All written correspondence should be addressed to:  Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.  All comments received will be provided to the Board of Directors.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC) intends to award modifications to its Facility Repair and Renewal (FRR) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts extending each contracts ordering pe riod consistent with the terms identified within this announcement.  The FRR program requirements are currently executed via firm fixed price and/or time and materials task orders which are placed against five (5) ID/IQ contracts in order to provide quick response for facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, additions, construction, equipment procurement / installation, and maintenance services on installed equipment/systems at Government installations and facilities.  All current contract award s were made under full and open competition procedures.  The ordering period for these contracts will expire in January 2008.  As a result, CEHNC is developing its acquisition strategy and conducting pre-award functions for the follow-on FRR acquisitions, under NAICS code 236220.  The solicitation(s) for the follow-on acquisitions were released in July 2007 with the projected awards to be made in Spring 2008.  Due to the lapse in coverage, it is necessary that the current contracts be extended to compensate  for the period in which there would have been no contract coverage.  Therefore, it is the Governments intention to modify the current FRR ID/IQ contracts to extend the ordering period by three (3) months with an additional three (3) month option period.  Once the follow-on acquisitions are awarded, ordering against the current contracts will cease.  The Government will not exercise the additional three (3) month option should the follow-on acquisitions be awarded prior to the period in which the additiona l three (3) month option would be exercised. The current contracts which the Government intends to modify consistent with the terms identified within this announcement are as follows:  DACA87-02-D-0035 (BMAR and Associates), DACA87-03-D-0004 (RCI, Inc., 8(a) Small Business), DACA87-03-D-0005 (Global Engineering & Construction LLC), DACA87-03-D-0006 (Vanguard Contractors LLC) and DACA87-03-D-0007 (Ameresco Solutions, Inc.).

<SUBJECT>--Modification to Extend Ordering Period for Current Medical Repair/Renewal contracts DACA87-03-D-0008, DACA87-03-D-0009, DACA87-03-D-0010, and DACA87-03-D-0011.
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC) intends to award modifications to its Medical Repair and Renewal (MRR) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts extending each contracts ordering per iod consistent with the terms identified within this announcement.  The MRR program requirements are currently executed via firm fixed price and/or time and materials task orders which are placed against four (4) ID/IQ contracts in order to provide quick r esponse for facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, additions, construction, equipment procurement / installation, and maintenance services on installed equipment/systems at Government installations and facilities.  All current contract awards  were made under full and open competition procedures.  The ordering period for these contracts will expire in January 2008.  As a result, CEHNC is developing its acquisition strategy and conducting pre-award functions for the follow-on MRR acquisitions, u nder NAICS code 236220.  The solicitation(s) for the follow-on acquisitions were released in July 2007 with the projected awards to be made in Spring 2008.  Due to the lapse in coverage, it is necessary that the current contracts be extended to compensate for the period in which there would have been no contract coverage.  Therefore, it is the Governments intention to modify the current MRR ID/IQ contracts to extend the ordering period by three (3) months with an additional three (3) month option period. Once the follow-on acquisitions are awarded, ordering against the current contracts will cease.  The Government will not exercise the additional three (3) month option should the follow-on acquisitions be awarded prior to the period in which the additional  three (3) month option would be exercised. The current contracts which the Government intends to modify consistent with the terms identified within this announcement are as follows:  DACA87-03-D-0008 (John J. Kirlin, Inc.), DACA87-03-D-0009 (BMAR and Associates), DACA87-03-D-0010 (J&J Maintenance, Inc.), and DACA87-03-D-0011 (Global Engineering and Construction, LLC).  The original basic contract Scope of Work for each contract award will remain unchanged.   The Government intends to award the modifications to these contracts consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source a nd no other services will satisfy requirement.  Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements would result given any other action due to current circumstances.  Due to the unique prior experience and involvement of the current contractors and  the anticipated recurring need for facility repairs and renovations, the actions proposed within this announcement are justified.  The Government will support the proposed actions by written justifications and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceedi ng.  The Government will synopsize the contract modifications after award.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

   (d) The Country Director is the chief representative of CDC in the Cooperating Country.  In this capacity, he/she is responsible for the total CDC Program in the Cooperating Country including certain administrative responsibilities set forth in this contract and for advising CDC regarding the performance of the work under the contract and its effect on the U.S. Foreign Assistance Program.  The contractor will be responsible for performing his/her duties in accordance with the statement of duties called for by the contract. However, he/she shall be under the general policy guidance of the Country Director, and shall keep the Country Director or his/her designated representative currently informed of the progress of the work under this contract.

SOCIAL SECURITY, FEDERAL INCOME TAX AND FOREIGN EARNED INCOME 
 
   (a)  Since the contractor is an employee, F.I.C.A. contributions and U.S. Federal Income Tax withholding shall be deducted in accordance with regulations and rulings of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, respectively.
 
   (b) As an employee, the contractor is not eligible for the 'foreign earned income' exclusion under the IRS Regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911- 3(c)(3)).

INSURANCE
 
   (a) Worker's Compensation Benefits.  The contractor shall be provided worker's compensation benefits in accordance with the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.
 
   (b) Health and Life Insurance.
 
     (1)  The contractor shall be provided  a maximum contribution of up to 50% against the actual costs of the contractor's annual health insurance costs, provided that such costs may not exceed the maximum U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management.
 
     (2) The contractor shall be provided a contribution of up to 50% against the actual costs of annual life insurance not to exceed $500.00 per year.
 
     (3)  Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts.  The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide or specifically excludes coverage overseas.  In such case, the contractor would be eligible for contributions under paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) as appropriate.
 
     (4)  Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid.  On assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance shall be prorated and paid accordingly.
 
     (5)  A contractor who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this provision.

<DESC>TECHNICAL POC:  David Kuehn, 202-366-6072 or david.kuehn@dot.gov  SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT DATES:  This BAA describes a two-phase process for proposal submission and evaluation.  In the first phase, short pre-proposals will be submitted for review.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) will ask for full proposals of those pre-proposals that are of interest to FHWA.  Further detail on proposed dates follows: (1) BAA Pre-Proposals are due electronically by 4:00 pm Eastern on February 15, 2008; (2) BAA Invitations for Full Proposals will be sent out on or about March 15, 2008, and proposals will be due electronically six weeks from the date of the Invitations for Full Proposals; (3) BAA final awards are anticipated to take place August/Sept 2008. OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The FHWA is soliciting for proposals for research and development projects that could lead to transformational changes and revolutionary advances for transportation planning in the United States.  The objective of this BAA is to advance the practice and application of transportation planning among state, regional and local transportation planning agencies in response to significant changes in the planning process and to identify new tools, techniques and approaches that respond to national transportation planning priorities. PROGRAM SCOPE: The program scope is intentionally ambitious and broad to address the wide spectrum of topics and objectives that the funded investigations can support. This program is intended to spur innovation and focus on high risk and high pay-off research and development projects. Incremental advances, demonstrations of existing technologies or applications of state and metropolitan transportation planning activities are not within the scope of this program. FOCUS AREAS:  Six focus areas within transportation planning are of particular strategic interest and relevance to the FHWA. Proposals in these areas are highly encouraged. This guidance is provided to help offerors in the development of proposals of particular interest to FHWA. These areas as consistent with emphasis areas identified for the Surface Transportation Environment and Planning Cooperative Research Program developed under Section 5207 of Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU); see http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/hep/step/index.htm for more information.  The six focus areas include: (1) CONGESTION MANAGEMENT: In this area, the objective will be to support the national strategy to reduce congestion on America's transportation network as well as support other initiatives to link operations and transportation planning. Research could focus on innovations in congestion pricing and private sector involvement in transportation investment. Research could support work to advance analysis tools for use in the measurement and evaluation of operational improvements and strategies in transportation planning and advance the Congestion Management Process (CMP). Research also could result in the development of new planning tools and programs for understanding, analyzing and responding to congestion problems. Note: How to improve consideration of non-recurring congestion and goods movement in the transportation planning process are topics that received attention from stakeholders in response to the announcement of the STEP program for FY 2008. (2) GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE: The goals of this emphasis area are to (1) better understand the contribution of transportation facilities and services to air pollution and greenhouse gases and their potential implications, including environmental and human health impacts; (2) develop and assess analytical methods to adequately identify and reduce transportation emissions that contribute to global climate change; (3) identify cost-effective mitigation strategies to reduce transportation emissions that contribute to global climate change; (4) improve understanding of climate change impacts on transportation facilities and systems and the ability to consider adaptations. Potential research activities could include evaluating greenhouse gas mitigation efforts; identifying new and innovative methods of communicating scientific and regulatory information on transportation-air quality to partners at State and local agencies and to stakeholders; assessing the potential impacts of climate change on transportation; and determining how to avoid and minimize potential climate change impacts during transportation system planning. Note: Impacts of climate change on the transportation system, methods for assessing transportation contribution to global climate change, development of decision tools for changing transportation-related impacts to global climate change and new methods for communicating long-term impacts and risk related to transportation planning and global climate change were research areas that received attention from stakeholders in response to the announcement of the STEP program for FY 2008. (3) FREIGHT PLANNING: Across most of the country, freight movements are growing as a share of transportation system volumes. The objective of this research will be to develop methods for the integration of freight into the transportation planning and programming processes at the State and metropolitan levels. Freight transportation issues are complex and involve many stakeholders who have different perspectives on the freight transportation system. Research could focus on innovative methods for effectively engaging the private sector freight community into the State and metropolitan planning processes; how parameters such as price, travel time, permitting, and user fees affect modal shift; what elasticities are inherent in these parameters; and new approaches for applying benefits/cost analyses of freight projects in the transportation planning process. Research also could develop new planning tools and programs such as freight analytical techniques, freight modeling improvements, methods of innovative freight data collection and data sharing. Note: Areas that Stakeholders identified in response to an announcement for the FY 2008 STEP program include improved methods for generation of freight trips and for considering multi-modal freight investment trade-offs. (4) PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE, VISUALIZATION IN PLANNING: There is a continued need for assessing new methods in public involvement and community impact assessment practice.  Environmental justice and visualization are emerging areas of research and practice for transportation planning practitioners that can be utilized to help convey and obtain technical information with communities that traditionally were not involved in the planning process. There is increasing awareness among state departments of transportation, metropolitan planning organizations and other government agencies of the importance of ensuring civil rights and environmental justice in the transportation planning process where there is a greater opportunity for making trade-offs to avoid impacts. Visualization applied to transportation planning is an emerging area of both research and practice. Stakeholders from state departments of transportation (DOTs), metropolitan planning organizations (MPO?s) and other interested parties are concerned about how to effectively apply visualization. Most agencies and practitioners have little or no awareness of examples. Research in visualization could result in applying new methods of communication between transportation practitioners, decision-makers and the public. Note:  Stakeholders identified evaluation of cost effective techniques for public participation, improved methods for considering highway operational strategies and pricing on specific populations, and use of visualization to consider potential system impacts when responding to the FY 2008 STEP announcement. (5) TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES THAT SUPPORT STATE AND LOCAL PLANNING CAPACITY BUILDING: In this area, research needs to consider audience needs, agency practices and process requirements in statewide and metropolitan transportation planning. Key emerging planning research issues for State DOTs could include asset management and program cost management. Key emerging research issues for metropolitan transportation planning could include new and innovative forecasting techniques, managing program finances and revenue and coordination with new planning partners through the development of new process or decision-support tools. In small communities and rural areas, transportation planning research could focus on emerging tools and techniques that would assist communities in maintaining their transportation system and more effectively prioritize and limited program resources. Transportation planning research in this area also could focus on effective applications of both technical and non-technical approaches and tools and addressing jurisdictional and institutional issues and could include the development of new planning tools to provide a framework for developing a shared vision for the future by analyzing various forces (e.g., health, transportation, economic, environmental, land use, etc.) that affect growth. NOTE: Stakeholders identified in response to the STEP FY 2008 announcement improved methods of fiscal constrain and asset management, alignment of public and private sector needs and bridging gaps between traditional four-step modeling, simulation and micro-simulation models including understanding their optimal value and use in helping forecast future traffic and appropriately plan and design for predicted travel trends.  (6) TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES THAT SUPPORT TRIBAL PLANNING CAPACITY BUILDING: For Tribal transportation planning, the objective of the coordinated research approach will be the development of innovative tools or approaches that will promote the integration of tribal issues into the transportation planning and programming processes at the State and metropolitan levels. Examples of research could include development of "Information Tools" for use by Tribal departments of transportation demonstrating effective consultation practices in the statewide and metropolitan transportation planning process. Tribal transportation planning research also could focus on innovative planning techniques to assist tribes in maintaining their transportation system and could define novel processes that would help Tribal Transportation Agencies more effectively utilize tools and technology even with limited resources. GENERAL PROPOSAL INFORMATION: All business and administrative correspondence or questions on this BAA should be directed to the contracting officer identified below. The FHWA has budgeted approximately $700,000 in fiscal year 2008 to fund this research program. Proposals will be evaluated using a two-part process consisting of pre-proposals and full-proposals. Offerors whose pre-proposals are of interest to FHWA will be invited to submit full proposals. The FHWA may select for award all, none, or a subset of the acceptable proposals to construct a balanced program meeting its needs. The FHWA anticipates making multiple awards, typically of 12-24 months duration with the size of individual awards varying from $50,000 to over $100,000 depending on the research area and study requirements. Awards with a total value (including full period of performance and any option periods) of $100,000 or under will be issued as purchase orders. Awards over $100,000 will be issued as contracts or cooperative agreements. The FHWA strongly encourages cost sharing under any contract that may result, and can offer cooperative agreements if the proposer can offer a cost share of 50 percent from non-federal sources of funding. For cooperative agreements, the Federal share of the cost of a project or activity carried out under this program is limited by Section 5101(b) of SAFETEA-LU to fifty (50) percent, unless otherwise determined by the Secretary of Transportation. The number of awards, and their dollar value, will vary depending on the merit of proposals received and their potential to lead to transformational changes and advances in transportation planning practice. Offerors should prepare proposals with a baseline period of performance of 12-24 months and, if needed, with one or more options up to an additional 24-month period of performance. EVALUATION CRITERIA: The primary basis for selecting proposals will be technical merit, importance to FHWA programs, and fund availability. Technical merit will be evaluated based on the following criteria, listed in descending order of relative importance:  (A) Fit of research in meeting recent changes in the transportation planning process and national planning priorities; (B) Understanding of current practice, trends and future needs relative to the research; (C) Understanding of how research could benefit practitioners involved in statewide, Tribal, metropolitan, local and small community transportation planning; (C) Impact of research on meeting current or future transportation planning needs (and reach of research well beyond the needs of a specific state or local agency); (D) Cost-effective use of federal funds; and (E) Experience and qualifications of the research team for conducting national-level research. The FHWA strongly encourages proposals that offer a significant non-federal matching funds or in-kind resources. Good proposals will evidence strong internal backing with matching funds, innovative approaches in contracting and leveraging current and past technology development efforts that support this program. Such proposals will receive consideration in addition to and above how they respond to the technical criteria above. Cost reasonableness and realism will also be considered in the overall selection process. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under the announcement. Selection will be based primarily on scientific or technical merit, partnership, relevance and importance to agency, and availability of funds. Note that all technically meritorious proposals may not be funded due to budgetary constraints.  GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING PRE-PROPOSAL AND FULL PROPOSAL PROCESS: Proposals may respond to one or more of the subject areas but must indicate which area is primary and which area or areas are subordinate.  Organizations also may submit more than one proposal when the proposed effort includes multiple disparate objectives and tasks, covers multiple or disparate technologies areas, or would have a more supportable budget if provided in parts; however, each proposal will be considered independently. Proposals will be evaluated using a two-part process: pre-proposals and full-proposals. The FHWA will evaluate pre-proposals against the evaluation criteria outlined above. Those offerors whose pre-proposals are of interest may be invited to submit a formal full-proposal, as described below.  Offerors whose pre-proposals are determined not to be of interest are not precluded from submitting a proposal and may do so if they desire. Approximately thirty (30) days after the pre-proposal submission deadline, offerors submitting pre-proposals will be contacted by the Technical Point of Contact with a letter informing them either that the FHWA is requesting a formal cost and technical proposal or that the effort proposed is not of interest to the Government. INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSION OF PRE-PROPOSALS:  Pre-proposals must be submitted via electronic mail, and must be received by the FHWA on or before 4:00 PM (EST), February 15, 2008, in order to be considered for fiscal year 2008 funding.  Facsimile transmissions or hard copy transmissions of the pre-proposal will not be accepted; any so sent will be disregarded.

Offerors who choose not to submit a pre-proposal but who wish to submit a full proposal may do so; they are advised to contact the contracting officer to obtain a copy of the full proposals instructions.  It is presently anticipated that full proposals will include a technical proposal no longer than 20 pages in length, as well as a separate cost proposal.

Awards involving any Privacy Act-covered data will require special clearances and protections. It is the policy of the FHWA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.

Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.

 HSAR 3052.209?70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

In November 2007, USAID/OTI launched a new program in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).  The Government of Pakistan (GOP) is focusing efforts to bring security and development to FATA, demonstrating a new commitment to the FATA through the creation of the FATA Secretariat (FS), and more recently the FATA Development Authority (FDA), to attract investment to the region.  The FS has recently produced the FATA Sustainable Development Plan (SDP) through which the GOP intends to bring sustained development to the region.  The GOP has pledged a billion dollars to the SDP and is actively soliciting additional funds from donor governments, including the United States.
       
The FATA Transition Initiative (FTI) program will support the Government of Pakistan's development efforts to better integrate FATA into the political and economic mainstream of Pakistan.  The FTI plans to engage the Government of Pakistan's FS and Political Agents as well as the FATA's tribes in participatory processes to identify community priorities and address some of the region's most immediate needs.  The FS and its representative Agency structures will constitute the key interlocutors within the GOP for this program.  The FTI effort will require close coordination with ongoing USAID, State Department and Department of Defense activities in the region.

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partners, Creative Associates and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), will manage an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc.  Small livelihood activities may be considered if it is clear they have the full support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.  In addition, the program will undertake media development activities and outreach efforts designed to increase the amount of information the FATA communities receive about the Government of Pakistan initiatives and development activities.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified country representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including, but not limited to, community development, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, democracy/governance and human rights.  Excellent inter-personal, presentation and negotiation skills are necessary.  Experience in contract/grant oversight is required.  Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies and management of program operations in a conflict environment is preferred. 

The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills, and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically charged and challenging security environments.

The Country Representative will:

* Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner's scope to OTI's country objectives, partner's budgets, and modifications thereto;

* Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the ADS;

* Ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;

* Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;

* Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;

* Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;

* Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the UN or host government, as appropriate;

QUESTION 1: Section 1.9-Travel: Please verify: our fee proposal should be exclusive of travel reimbursable expenses?

QUESTION 2: Section 4.0 Solicitation Requirements, Section 4.2 Could you elaborate on your needs for Site Analysis, so we can determine scope and appropriate expertise ? do you have a finite number of sites to analyze?  Or is the analysis open-ended?

ANSWER 2: The site analysis could inventory what resources and limitations the site possesses today. Then, a site analysis of these inherent characteristics could be carried out. The analysis is open-ended and there would be a minimum of two sites to analyze.

QUESTION 3: Section 4.9 - Research and Evaluation: please elaborate ? what type of research and evaluation area you requiring?

ANSWER 4: Correct, it should read Relevant Past Performance instead of Relevant Price Performance. A separate amendment will be issued on this correction.

QUESTION 5: The RFP asks for a Site Analysis. Is this a question of assessing the relative market suitability of a number of specific options in New London? Or does it require architectural and engineering expertise to assess structures, environmental conditions, and zoning codes? Or is it a question of describing an ideal site, with a formal site selection process happening later?

ANSWER 5: In addition to the response to Question 2, the sites to have a museum built have been chosen. 

QUESTION 6: Where will meetings at the ?Government facility? be held? In New London or Washington?

ANSWER 13: See the answer to Question 3

QUESTION 14: When do you plan to award the contract? Will this go to an interview phase?

ANSWER 14: It is anticipated that the contract will be awarded by 31 December 2008. It is also expected that this procurement will not go to an interview phase. As stated in the solicitation, ?The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a Contract without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer shall contain the Contractor?s best terms from a technical and price standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.?

QUESTION 15: Can you supply any information re the budget of this project? Either for just the Master Plan or for the whole project? 

ANSWER 15: The budget for the Master Plan Project cannot be released because it is procurement sensitive information. A tentative budget for the overall Museum Project of $60 Million is planned.  Additional budget related response will be provided to the awarded contractor. 

QUESTION 16: You mention that the proposal needs to be submitted in 2 separate
binders: one will have the relevant price performance info as well as the technical info, and one will have the price info. What is the difference between the relevant price performance and the price information?

ANSWER 16: See answer to Question 4.

QUESTION 17: Can we get a copy of the referenced United States Coast Guard Museum Feasibility, Programming, and Siting Study?

ANSWER 17: All relevant historical and/or museum developmental materials and files will be available to the awarded Contractor. 

QUESTION 18: The current museum receives 20,000 visitors annually ? is there an attendance goal for the new facility? 

ANSWER 18: Original Business Case plan was for 200,000 based on 2002 Study which would be made available upon award.  However, the Coast Guard would like the firm selected to complete an independent analysis of likely attendance as part of the Strategic Master Plan.   

QUESTION 19: Does the general public have open access to the current museum, and to the proposed new sites?

ANSWER 19: Yes

QUESTION 20: Is the 40,000-60,000 sq. ft. figure for the entire building?

ANSWER 20: Yes.  This size of the museum has varied over the years based on perceived location, suspected funding streams, etc.  The Coast Guard would like the firm selected to help determine the best size for such a museum given our situation at this time. 

QUESTION 21: Do you plan to consolidate collections storage at this location?

ANSWER 21: Some, but not the majority of our collection currently in storage. 

QUESTION 22: Section 4.15-Milestone Plan: assume this is a milestone for subsequent design and construction of the museum.  Is there an anticipated date (range) for completion of the overall project?

ANSWER 22: If possible, the Coast Guard and its associates would like to break ground in 2010.

QUESTION 23: Will eventual funding for the project be private, government, or a mix thereof?

ANSWER 23: A mixture thereof.

QUESTION 24: Section 5.0-References: includes National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), and Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act.  Are the potential museum sites considered historic, or to have archaeological significance?

ANSWER 24: Two of the sites are near Fort Trumbull State Park in New London, CT and NHPA considerations will need to be considered in the design if built there.  A third possible location being considered in New London may have some archaeological significance, but the State of Connecticut has not completed their survey of this parcel yet, thus the caution.

QUESTION 25: Have you established a budget for the Master Plan?

ANSWER 25: See answer to Question 15.

QUESTION 26: Does a formal story-line exist or has one been approved? If not, should we include the research and submission of a draft outline as a deliverable with the final report?

ANSWER 26: Yes, a tentative story-line has been discussed. A final approved story-line can be included as a deliverable with the final report.

QUESTION 27: How do you anticipate using the Strategic Master Plan?  Who might be its readers/users?

ANSWER 27: Readers/users of the Master Plan will include the National Coast Guard Museum Association, Senior Coast Guard Leadership, contracted architects, interested members of Congress and eventually, the general public.

QUESTION 28: Are your expectations for a comprehensive, well-thought through institutional plan, or an illustrated short sales document?

ANSWER 28: A comprehensive, well-thought through institutional plan.

QUESTION 29: Who did the USCG Museum Feasibility, Programming, and Siting Study? When was that study done and is it still relevant? Is a copy of it available?

ANSWER 29: All relevant historical and or museum developmental material and files will be available to the awarded Contractor. A copy of this study will be provided to the firm awarded the contract.   Due to Federal legislation enacted in 2004 requiring the proposed Coast Guard Museum to be build in New London, CT, it is not considered current.

QUESTION 37: Are we expected to develop that site or just submit ideas for development of the site in support of the museum?

ANSWER 37: Just submit ideas for development of the site in support of the museum.

QUESTION 38: What is your expected use of the proposed museum anticipated by you other than exhibits and education and training?

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.
