<DESC>This publication serves as a notice of intent to procure on a sole source basis, with Ossidian Technologies, Ltd., for a period of 1-year.  The authority is only one reasonable source 10 U.S.C.2304 (C)(1). This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/HQ intends for Ossidian to expand current SOLAR content offerings to include courses in wireless communications technology.  Ossidian, a vendor of the European Space Agency, is the only known source able to provide the type of technical content.	The course will provide much needed content for engineering, technical and non-technical staff and management as well as software developers and integrators. Ossidian will allow NASA to load content on SOLAR, without additional use of programming resources or purchase of a vendor specific platform.  This allows us to deliver to NASA learners 24 x7 access to this content with out concern for center specific security requirements. Preliminary testing of the Ossidian courses has demonstrated compatibility with NASA systems and supported software.  The ability to "plug and play" content on the SOLAR system and deliver to NASA civil servant and contractors, using either MacIntosh or Windows systems with either Internet Explorer 5.) and Netscape 4.6 makes them truly unique in the marketplace. NASA's e-Learning Strategic Plan calls for increasing the availability of on-line courses, and resources available to NASA users.  Adding Ossidian's AICC compliant, technically compatible courses to NASA's SOLAR site will be a great benefit to NASA learners. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 5/23/2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>East and Central Africa Global Competitiveness Hub (ECA Hub) activities form part of the U.S. Government's Trade for African Development and Enterprise (TRADE) Initiative.  The TRADE Initiative seeks to mobilize U.S. and African partners from the public and private sectors to support specific trade capacity building needs. Three regional Hubs have been established in Accra, Ghana; Gaborone, Botswana; and Nairobi, Kenya.  The Trade Hubs facilitate capacity building activities through linkages with African regional trade organizations and networks, in collaboration with U.S. and African educational and business networks, U.S. and African government agencies, and other donors.   

The TRADE Initiative has six themes, namely to:

"	Enhance the competitiveness of East and Central African (ECA) products and services;
"	Expand the role that trade can play in African poverty reduction strategies;
"	Promote U.S.- ECA business linkages;
"	Improve the delivery of public services supporting trade;
"	Strengthen ECA capacity for trade policy formulation and implementation; and
"	Strengthen the enabling environment for ECA businesses.

Based in Nairobi, the ECA Hub covers Burundi, Central African Republic, Comoros, Congo (Brazzaville), Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa), Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.
  
The contractor for the ECA Hub will be required to work with the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA), a principal partner to REDSO based in Lusaka, Zambia, and the Transit Transport Coordinating Authority of the Northern Corridor (TTCA) based in Mombasa, Kenya. Other partners will be engaged in as far as their activities promote COMESA agenda of creating a common market where goods, services and people move freely using standards adopted from the World Trade Organization. The ECA Hub will ensure that trade between Africa and the U.S is promoted under the African Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA).  Promoting efficient customs facilitation will be important to ensure seamless movement of goods from one country to another. Enterprise capacity building and linkages for the export market will be another area of concern. The Northern Corridor from Mombasa to Democratic Republic of Congo) will act as a fast track model for all the activities the Hub will implement in the region. 
 
In summary, to achieve the objectives of the TRADE Initiative through the ECA Hub, USAID/REDSO is pursuing improvements in four key areas:
"	Building capacity for trade policy formulation and implementation with specific emphasis on the World Trade Organization and COMESA;
"	Promoting business development and market linkages under the African Growth and Opportunity Act;
"	Harmonizing customs and trade facilitation policies for the countries (Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo) covered under the Hub taking the Northern Corridor countries as the model;
"	Increasing efficiency and reducing the cost of trade related transportation on the Northern Corridor and creating an operating model for replication by other interested parties in other corridors.

The ECA Hub was opened in October 2002, and the first year of operations is being implemented under a one year, $1.5 million contract between USAID/REDSO and Chemonics International.  The work plan for the first year of the ECA Hub will be provided with the RFP. The soon to be issued RFP for the ECA Hub will require a firm to implement this activity from the second to the fifth year (four-year performance period) starting in late September 2003.

The RFP document will be posted to FBO approximately (15-19) days from this Synopsis posting. The Solicitation number will be RFP: 623-03-014. No additional notice will be given concerning the RFP Solicitation date of issuance/posting.  Once the RFP Solicitation is posted to http://www.fbo.gov/ website, this will allow you to view/download/print the document to prepare your submission, if your organization decides to submit a proposal.  The RFP Solicitation will also identify the government website(s) to view/download/print any forms which must be used by offerors submitting a proposal.  The Office issuing the RFP Solicitation will NOT mail forms or hard RFP copies out.   

The Cover Letter to the RFP Solicitation will advise that there will be approximately (15) calendar days from the RFP issuance date allowed for the electronic submission of questions about any Section of the RFP document.  Approximately week later, the USAID will post to http://www.fbo.gov/ answers to all questions by issuing an Amendment to the RFP Solicitation.  Questions submitted after (15) day period may be answered (and, possibly, another Amendment may need to be issued) however, extending the RFP's closing date is NOT considered.

<DESC>The United States Department of labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is seeking sources to conduct demonstration projects for advancing the current state of technology in detecting underground mine voids.  MSHA envisions the use of modification of geo-technical and geo-physical detection methods, but any proposed technology or method, or combination of technology and methods, will be considered.  Methods may include, but are not limited to, long-hole directional drilling, seismic reflection/refraction, ground pentrating radar, subterranean robotics, and electromagnetic methods.
On July 24, 2002 , a nonfatal entrapment accident occurred at Quecreek #1 Mine, Black Wolf Coal Company.  This incident brought national attention to a common problem in the coal mining industry.  In the United States, there have been more than 100 incidents since 1995 where miners have inadvertently broken into abandoned underground mines.  Unavailable, inaccurate or incomplete mapping of abandoned mines is typically responsible.  MSHA is planning to resolve the mine mapping issue in another solicitation.  MSHA intends to issue a solicitation that will result in the award of one, or more contracts for field demonstration of the detection methods and technology tha can be certified as acceptable standard industry practice by the mining industry.  MSHA wants to examine the capabilities of any geo-technical or geo-physical methods tha can be confidently and practically applied to detect voids and prevent inundation hazards.  The ultimate objective in support of the MSHA mission is to accurately identify mine voids in advance of mining.  These voids may present potential hazards to miners from water or gas inundation.  For example, Identifying voids and hazards can be accomplished by locating mine voids over a broad area well in advance of mining, by vertifying the boundaries of adjacent mines, and/or by locating voids a safe distance ahead of the advancing face.
Offerors who are selected to demonstrate their proposed methodology and technology will be required to document the results of the field demonstration that will be attended by MSHA personnel.  MSHA will make arrangements for location and resources needed to conduct the demonstration at the conclusion of the selection process.
Offerors who are interested in being includes on the solicitation mailing list must submit a written request to:

The WD TC also plans, conducts, evaluates, and reports on non-CB testing for the Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies (e.g., environmental assessment/impact evaluations, weapons and munitions demilitarization, hazard assessments, and technical/l ogistical support of Air Force operations at DPG). DPG participates in development of technology and methodology to support assigned testing.  Test programs include evaluation of munitions, CB detection and protection devices, testing to determine nuclear/biological/chemical (NBC) contamination / decontami nation survivability of various DoD materiel and equipment, and a wide range of developmental testing and applied research related to tactics, techniques, and procedures.  Test procedures involve artillery and mortar fire, aerial spray trials, physical and  environmental stress testing, human factors engineering, virtual reality methodology/implementation, accelerated climatic storage, contamination / decontamination evaluations, and performance and reliability testing of items in the field or within enclose d chambers.

<SUBJECT>D -- CONSOLICDATED VOICE SWITCHING SYSTEMS SUPPORT (CoVSS)
<SOLNBR>F426200-03-R-AAAA
<RESPDATE>053003
<ARCHDATE>08302003
<CONTACT>Robert Sleight, Contracting Officer, Phone 801-586-3462, Fax 801-586-3366, Email robert.sleight@hill.af.mil
<DESC>The US Air Force Telecommunications Product Group Manager requires acquisition and logistics support of US Air Force Unsecure Voice Switching Systems for an anticipated contract period of 10 years.  The program must be executed with minimum risk, be responsive to operational needs, and have engineered solutions that focus on technologies that ensure cost-effective operations while satisfying unique DoD telecommunications requirements.  This Request for Information (RFI) (1) announces Air Force intentions to provide centralized life-cycle logistic support (sustainment) for telecommunications Voice Switching Systems (VSS) worldwide.  (2) Provides an opportunity for industry and other interested parties to make inputs to this decision process by assisting Ogden Air Logistics Center in their efforts to understand market capabilities through market research, existing contracts, and any other pertinent information for planning purposes.  Although the contract will be managed by the Air Force, it is anticipated other Department of Defense (DoD) activities (e.g., Navy, Marine Corp, and the Defense Information Systems Agency) will utilize this contract.  Applicable Voice Switching Systems consist primarily of the following switch families with associated peripherals and transmission media equipment: 1. Avaya Definity G3r and Definity G3si/G3i Private Branch Exchange (PBX), 2. Hitachi America, Ltd. DX/HDX/HCX5400 PBX, 3. Lucent Technologies Lucent 5ESS and AT&T 5ESS Central Office (CO), 4. Mitel Networks SX-2000 and SX-200 PBX, 5. NEC America, Inc. NEAX2400 PBX, 6. Nortel Networks Corporation SL-100/DMS-100/DMS-200 Central Office (CO) and Meridian 1 PBX, 7. Siemens Corporation HICOM 300, HICOM 350 and HICOM 372 Computerized Branch Exchange (CBX).  This is not an RFP or IFB.  The only purpose of this RFI is to obtain industry comments and will be used by the Government for informational purposes only.  The Air Force does not intend to award a contract or contracts on the basis of this request nor will we pay for the information requested.  The potential future solicitation may allow for multiple awards depending on the response received from this announcement.  Contractors interested in viewing the Draft Statement of Need, and Draft Switch List should visit the CoVSS Website at http://contracting.hill.af.mil/NewContracting/Opportunities/SpaceC3I/CoVSS/covss-hp.htm.  Contractor questions regarding this RFI should be submitted via electronic mail (email) to Robert Sleight at Robert.Sleight@hill.af.mil.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  Only email requests received directly from the requester are acceptable.  Email response to this RFI is preferred.

A. Sustainment Options.  The United States Air Force (USAF) utilizes Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for logistics management of a suite of VSS and associated peripheral equipment. Current CLS services consist of repair and return of failed hardware, and provisioning, pre-positioning and maintenance of spares inventories, tiered engineering technical assistance, emergency field level support and training.

1.  What does a typical logistics infrastructure consist of in the private sector?  Please elaborate on any “closed” networks that would somewhat resemble DoD systems (e.g. banking, universities, state governments, etc.).  

2.  There is no current acquisition and logistics support contract vehicle in place for all Air Force unsecure switches.  CoVSS will encompass a myriad of switches such as NORTEL, AVAYA, LUCENT, SEIMENS, ROLM, etc.  How do you propose to support a wide variety of switches?  Do you recommend an integrating contractor with separate contract vehicles for each product line or a different approach?  Please provide pros and cons for different scenarios.

3.  Are you currently providing life cycle support for any Air Force or DoD Voice Switching Systems? If so, what and where?

4.  The USAF operates VSS sites all over the world (Europe, Middle East, Pacific Rim, etc.).  How would your company provide service to these extremely remote sites?  Examples of such sites are Thule, Greenland, and Ascension Island.

5.  What is the industry average time to respond to an emergency repair (Continental United States and Outside Continental United States)?  What is your company’s experience in this area?

6.  Performance specifications will be driven by “five nines” reliability.  What would be your methodology for calculating and verifying operational reliability?

7.  Do you have experience with problems that occur when shipping parts to various countries?  If so, what lessons have you learned that can be applied to this effort?

8.  How do you propose meeting the requirements of low volume switching systems?

B.  Upgrades/expansions.  As the USAF stays current with new technologies, we often rely on CLS contracts to support upgrades and expansions.

1.  What is a reasonable response time to provide a fully engineered solution in the form of a firm fixed price proposal from the time of receipt of a Statement of Objectives?

2.  What is a reasonable response time to initiate and complete a solution once a proposal is put on contract?  For example, time to do a routine software upgrade and the time to perform a remove and replace of a switch.



3.  How does industry provide cost estimates to assist customers’ budgeting and planning needs?  What level of accuracy should be expected for these types of proposals?

4.  Have you installed switching systems at Air Force or other DoD sites?

C.  Configuration Management.  Unique DoD telecommunications requirements demand a configuration management process that tracks network and switch level configuration.  Configuration management also requires detailed inventories down to the “card level.”

1.  Configuration Management is an issue with any complex system.  What is the industry practice for tracking configuration for telecommunications systems?  What is your experience in facilitating configuration management of a wide variety and large number of VSS applications at sites worldwide?

D.  Government-Industry Partnering.  The USAF desires to develop a healthy long-term partnership in this effort that will be mutually beneficial to all parties.

1.  What are typical industry practices for partnering?

2.  What is a typical contract structure and pricing arrangement for similar non-governmental contracts you are performing or have performed?

3.  What types of incentives, either monetary or non-monetary, do you believe would be effective to encourage quality contract performance in the areas of systems engineering, cost, schedule, and performance?

4.  Some companies envision themselves as integrators, others see themselves as the direct service providers.  What is your recommendation for a large network such as those found in DoD?  Why?

5.  What is industry’s standard for length of contract and options in years for a contract of this type?  Example: base contract of 4 years with two 2-year options, or a 2-year base with one-year options, etc.  What considerations should the Government give to a long-term partnership with industry?

6.  What are your lessons learned from other government or commercial contracts that are applicable to this effort?

7.  Do you presently have arrangements with sub-contractors to support a contract of this size?  What type of partnering with subcontractors do you envision?

8.  What is the industry practice for training customers on new equipment?  How does your company propose to provide training to government personnel on hardware and software?

9.  What comments do you have on supporting leased equipment or equipment that is not owned by the U.S. Government (e.g., foreign governments)?

E.  Consulting for Technology Migration.  Telecommunication technology is expected to change significantly during the course of this contract.  We want to ensure that all concerned are well positioned to accommodate these changes.

1.  What is the industry practice for providing network level technology roadmaps to customers?  What is your experience in this area?

2.  How would you propose updating new technology, as it becomes available, to existing switches and equipment covered by the CoVSS contract?  

3.  What specific suggestions do you have for best approach to supporting emerging technologies?

F.  Allied Support
1.	Do you have experience managing/coordinating allied support for such efforts as facility/infrastructure remodeling (includes electrical, plumbing, etc)?  Do you currently have any sub-contractors that can provide allied support?  What is your experience in this area with government customers?

G.  Definitions:  General Department of Defense definitions may be found at http://deskbook.dau.mil/jsp/default.jsp.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Office of the Scientific Director (OSD), Basic Neuroscience Program (BNP) plans to procure instrumentation from the Washington University, School of Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, 660 South Euclid, Campus Box 8054, St. Louis, MO 63110-1093.  This request for supplies/services is being prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  Background Dr. Ling-Gang Wu, M.D., Ph.D. from Washington University School of Medicine, was selected from a tenure track search for a position at NINDS.  Dr. Wu has several pieces of equipment, which have been calibrated by him, and it is essential to his research that this equipment be brought to the NIH/NINDS, in order to maintain the consistency in his experiment and not hamper his ability to begin his research as a time limited tenure track investigator. Dr. Wu's research focuses on how the nervous system relies on synaptic transmission at synapses.  Synaptic vesicle cycling process, which includes vesicle exocytosis, endocytosis and mobilization from the reserve pool to the readily releasable pool, is essential to synaptic transmission.  Dr. Wu studies the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying modulation of each step in the vesicle cycling process, and their contribution to synaptic plasticity, such as short-term synaptic depression and paired-pulse facilitation.  The preparation he uses is the calyx-type synapse in the medical nucleus of the trapezoid body in the auditory brainstem of the rat.  The techniques used include 1) simultaneous voltage-clamp recording of the presynaptic terminal and the postsynaptic neuron at single synapses in brain slices, 2) optical imaging of presynaptic Ca²  concentrations, 3) monitoring the kinetics of vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis with measurements of the membrane capacitance at the nerve terminal, 4) imaging synaptic vesicle dynamics with the activity-dependent styryl dyes (e.g., FM1-43), and 5) some molecular biology techniques.  The equipment includes three setups for the electrophysiological recordings, such as voltage-clamp recordings and capacitance recording that NINDS uses daily.  Each setup includes mainly a microscope, two amplifier for simultaneous presynaptic and postsynaptic recording that NINDS use daily, and two manipulators for positioning of the electrodes into the neurons.  In addition, there is a puller for making proper electrodes for electrophysiological recordings.  All of this equipment is used currently in his lab for the study of synaptic transmission and is essential for the function of his unit at NINDS.  Washington University School of Medicine is the only source known that can supply the equipment that Dr. Wu requires to continue his research.  Changing variables at this time will substantially interrupt correct interpretation of experiment in progress.  Based on the aforementioned,  Dr. Wu was selected as a highly competitive candidate for an NINDS Tenure Track position.  He is well respected and highly motivated researcher.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington DC time) on May 23, 2003.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Urologic Oncology Branch (UOB), plans to procure two, second year urology residence to perform services and support from Georgetown University Medical Center Operations, 4000 Reservoir Road NW 120 Bldg. 10, Washington, D.C., 20007.  The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 622110 and the business size standard is $29M.  
Background:  There are very few opportunities to obtain urologic surgery physicians to evaluate and manage patients at the NCI.  The urologic surgery program at the National Cancer Institute evaluates patients with known or suspected urologic cancer and manages a large number of patients with hereditary forms of cancers of the kidney and other organs.  These patients are evaluated in the Clinical Center of the NIH and are entered into clinical trials involving medical as well as surgical therapy.  NCI has a need for two second year urological surgery residents in approved training programs to see the patients, manage them in the clinic, as inpatients and in the operating room under the direct supervision of an NCI urological surgery attending surgeon.  The NCI urologic surgery program is also responsible for all urologic care at the Clinical Center, NIH.  Second year urological surgical residents have the unique skills and training and education required to evaluate and manage patients with urologic disorders at the NCI.  It is important that the residents be from a urologic surgery program that is less than one hour from NIH and that the urology program that they are from be approved by the Residency Review Committee (RRC) for this activity.  The residents must be in an RRC-approved residency program and the RRC must have approved this activity.  This is important for the educational mission of the Urologic Oncology Branch and for the Urologic Oncology Fellowship program at the NCI.  Physicians at the Urologic Oncology Branch, CCR, NCI have had a long standing relationship and are conducting joint collaborative studies with physicians from the Division of Urology at the Georgetown University Medical Center.   Contractor Requirements: The physicians need to be residents in urologic surgery and have at lease one year of urological surgical training experience.  Residents must be able to manage patients with complex urologic disorders before surgery, in the operating room and after surgery in the post-operative period.  They also must be able to manage critical urological surgical emergencies in pre and post-operative patients.  These physicians shall provide urologic medical care for the Urologic Oncology Branch (UOB) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The urology residents shall evaluate urologic surgical patients in the clinic and shall assist in surgery in the operating room.  All activities shall be performed under the direction of an attending urologic surgeon.  Residents shall rotate on the Urologic Surgery service and assist with the management of in-patients as well as outpatients at the Clinical Center, NIH.  Residents shall take night and weekend call while on the urologic surgery rotation at the Clinical Center.  Residents shall attend scheduled patient care rounds and didactic lecture sessions.  Residents assigned to UOB/NCI rotation shall work on the clinical service.  Each resident must be credentialed at UOB/NCI at least one (1) month prior to assignment at NIH. The Urologic Surgery Residents from the Georgetown University Hospital shall serve on the clinical service of the Urologic Oncology Branch.  In that capacity they shall manage patients in the clinic, in the operating room and in the in-patient units.  Residents shall participate in surgical management of patients with complex urologic cancers and in clinical trials for patients with Genitourinary Malignancies. Residents shall participate in clinical trials and assist in the operating room and in the clinic.  Residents shall learn about research protocols, about novel approaches to surgical as well as medical therapy and about the conduct of clinical trials.  Residents shall also get exposure to basic research and to the fundamental aspect of cancer genetics.  Residents will learn advanced techniques for laparoscopic management of localized as well as advanced GU malignancies as well as the critical role of a team approach to management of patients with advanced urologic malignancies.  The residents shall be assigned to the clinical service of the Urologic Oncology Branch for a 6-month period each.  Residents shall manage in-patients, outpatients and assist with surgery in the operating room.  They shall take night and weekend calls on the Urologic Oncology Clinical call schedule.  Their entire clinical activities shall be under the direct supervision of an attending urologic surgeon. The Urology Residents are responsible for completing the physician credentialing including the completion and transmission to the Urologic Oncology Branch original signed documents to include a Record of Participation in Patient Care, Delineation and Privileges, and Applications for Short-Term Appointment. During the period in which any physician is assigned to this contract, the physicians must always remain within commuting distance of the NIH Clinical Center.  Residents shall be required to provide in house medical coverage at night, weekends, and holidays as assigned, and wear name tags or ID badges at all times.  Residents shall accept that they are subject to a written evaluation of their professional performance at the completion of each tour/rotation at NCI. Contractor shall provide liability insurance for the resident physicians.  The urology residents shall not be covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act.  The residents shall accept that all patient files are the property of the UOB/NCI and are subject to the Confidentiality clause contained herein.  Any and all data, including information generated on computer is subject to the Confidentiality clause. Residents must be within commuting distance of the NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD.  Period of Performance: Upon award through 12 months. The contractor shall provide two second year urology residents for the period of six (6) months each.  Georgetown University Medical Center is the only known source that can provide two second year residents to perform the aforementioned services.  Georgetown is also the only known University Urology Department who can send urological surgical second year residents to NCI for 12 months who are approved for this activity by the Urologic Surgery Residency Review Committee.  It is also important to have highly skilled surgeons from a program such as Georgetown that has high clinical standards who can provide outstanding surgical and medical care to the patient population at NCI.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington DC time) on May 23, 2003.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent on holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Department of labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is seeking sources to conduct demonstration projects for advancing the current state of technology in detecting underground mine voids.  MSHA envisions the use of modification of geo-technical and geo-physical detection methods, but any proposed technology or method, or combination of technology and methods, will be considered.  Methods may include, but are not limited to, long-hole directional drilling, seismic reflection/refraction, ground pentrating radar, subterranean robotics, and electromagnetic methods.
On July 24, 2002 , a nonfatal entrapment accident occurred at Quecreek #1 Mine, Black Wolf Coal Company.  This incident brought national attention to a common problem in the coal mining industry.  In the United States, there have been more than 100 incidents since 1995 where miners have inadvertently broken into abandoned underground mines.  Unavailable, inaccurate or incomplete mapping of abandoned mines is typically responsible.   MSHA intends to issue a solicitation that will result in the award of one, or more contracts for field demonstration of the detection methods and technology tha can be certified as acceptable standard industry practice by the mining industry.  MSHA wants to examine the capabilities of any geo-technical or geo-physical methods tha can be confidently and practically applied to detect voids and prevent inundation hazards.  The ultimate objective in support of the MSHA mission is to accurately identify mine voids in advance of mining.  These voids may present potential hazards to miners from water or gas inundation.  For example, Identifying voids and hazards can be accomplished by locating mine voids over a broad area well in advance of mining, by vertifying the boundaries of adjacent mines, and/or by locating voids a safe distance ahead of the advancing face.
Offerors who are selected to demonstrate their proposed methodology and technology will be required to document the results of the field demonstration that will be attended by MSHA personnel. The awardee is responsible for making arrangements for location and resources needed to conduct the demonstration at the conclusion of the selection process.

<DESC>The anticipated release date for the solicitation is revised from May 9, 2003, to June 27, 2003. In addition to the above, a solicitation message was posted to the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) web site on April 11, 2003, but did not appear on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web location.  Therefore, DOE is including the supplemental message to the Pre-solicitation Notice in this synopsis modification (see below). Supplement to Pre-solicitation Notice Number DE-RP01-03SO40005: The Department of Energy (DOE) has received several telephone calls and e-mails requesting individual briefings on the solicitation identified in Pre-solicitation Notice Number DE-RP01-03SO40005 announcing the Government's intent to issue a solicitation.  Although the primary purposes of the notice are to improve small business access to acquisition information and enhance competition by identifying contracting and/or subcontracting opportunities, the Statement of Work, place of performance, and delivery schedule will not be available until the solicitation is issued. In the interest of time and in order to preserve the integrity of the Federal procurement process by ensuring fair treatment to all interested parties, the DOE is restating the original information provided in the notice. With the exception of the name and address of the incumbent contractor (see below), all other telephone requests and written correspondence will not be answered unless resubmitted in writing after the release of the RFP during the question and answer period. Based on the above, the next exchange of information will be via issuance of the solicitation.  No additional exchanges, pre-proposal conferences, or meetings between the Program Office or the Procurement Office will be entertained.  The solicitation cover letter will include provisions for a written question and answer period that can be utilized by all interested parties to improve their understanding of the Government's requirement in order to increase efficiency in proposal preparation. Incumbent Contractor: Jupiter Corporation Suite 900, Westfield North 2730 University Boulevard West Wheaton, MD  20902 NOTE:  Due to a difference in the IIPS format and the FedBizOpps format, this synopsis modification is also correcting an error that appeared in FedBizOpps: Under General Information, "N/A" was inadvertently entered for Set Aside. This acquisition will be 100% set aside for small business concerns.

<DESC>NA This Amendment replaces Amendment No. 3: 1. Please also let me know if the 1m host cable is external or internal, if the terminators are internal or external and the quantity of terminators needed.   Answer: The 1 ea SCSI cable is external and so is the 1-ea terminator.  There are SCSI cables internally to connect the hard drives to the backplane.  That question is answered below. 2) How many drives will be installed on each drive channel and how many on the host channel? Answer:  11 drives total installed in unit.   We will configure how it will be used. 3) How many internal SCSI cables are needed?  Answer:  Enough for the unit to use all four channels. 4) Do you want preassembled unit or do you want parts only?  Answer:  Preassembled.  Hard drives can be shipped separately f or protection. Pre-configured for RAID 5. 5) Do you need all the HDDs to be hot swappable? If not, can we put two HDDs in the hidden drive bays?  Answer: All drives must be hot swappable. 6) Is the Infortrend SR150 RAID controller integrated into the 3U, 11-Bay Redundant RAID chassis or does the Infortrend SR150 RAID controller reside in a separate enclosure or chassis?  Answer:  It takes up a bay.  The chassis has 12 bays, 11 have the hot swappable drive chassis and 1 has the RS 150 RAID controlled in the slot. 7) The specs show only 10 bay: it should be 11 bays. Is Dual hot swappable power and cooling OK?  Dual is missing from the hot swappable power and cooling line.  The corrected item should read:  11 Bay Redundant RAID Chassis: Hot-swappable hard drive carriers, dual hot-swa ppable power and cooling, rackmount model.  Includes slide rail rack kit.  8) Can you use the SR 2500 instead of the SR 150?  Answer - No because it doesn't meet the GUI RAID Manager requirement.  (Not on bid to outside. The line below gives the information missing).  It should be added to the spec.  Battery-protected ECC memory; 128MB (up to 1GB) Firmware embedded Java-based GUI RAID manager with real-time event notification and monitoring.  Up to 32 LUNs per host ID.

<DESC>Modification to the listed below Presolicitation Notice to change the dollar threshold from $6 million to $23 million for NAICS Code
561210.



The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a negotiated procurement for Consolidated Facilities Management (CFM) services to operate and maintain the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library (Center) in Abilene, Kansas. Estimated Cost Range: $5,000,000 over a five (5) year period (Base Year of 12 months and four (4) Option Years of twelve (12) months each). The Contractor must provide all management, supervision, personnel, engineering, equipment and tools not furnished as GFP, materials, parts, supplies (i.e., light bulbs, filters, etc.), subcontracts, and transportation necessary to perform the Mechanical and Operational Maintenance, Janitorial/Custodial, Grounds Maintenance and Landscaping Services, including Snow and Ice Removal, at the Eisenhower Center in accordance with: (1) the manufacturer's recommendations and specifications; (2) industry standards and codes; (3) Federal, State, and local regulations; (4) GSA Preventive Maintenance Guides; (5) Federal environmental standards; and (6) OSHA regulations.  The Eisenhower Center is the traditional name given to the five-building complex which makes up the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library.  The Center is a part of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The Center consists of a 22- acre complex.  The Center receives on average 80,000 to 100,000 visitors each year.  Major events occur outdoors with attendance at times between 5,000 and 10,000.  The Center includes the Library, Museum, Family Home, Visitors Center, and the Place of Meditation that is also called the Chapel.  In addition to these five major structures, there is a service building with office space and a garage near the Library, a metal storage building near the service building, a fountain in front of the Chapel, a larger than life statue in the center of the grounds, five memorial Pylons at the east end of the Center, a kiosk housing a photo exhibit west of the Museum, and a working solar panel system east of the Museum.  Except for the Boyhood Home that is a wood frame house and the metal storage building, all of the buildings are constructed of native limestone. The Center and its grounds are open to and used by the public from 9:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. seven days per week, 362(3) days a year.  Mechanical services are required 365(6) days a year, twenty-four hours a day, 7 days a week.  In the summer, some buildings are open from 8:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m.   In addition, the public also uses certain areas of the buildings for public programs in the evenings. Tourists and local people also walk on our extensive sidewalks throughout the day, evening, and early daylight hours.  The Eisenhower Center has a very high level of visibility to Government, non-Government and international organizations. It hosts former Presidents, Heads of State, and other important visitors on an individual and group basis, with many social functions conducted at the Library facilities. As a result, the highest quality mechanical services are essential to the day-to-day operation of the Library.  The Presidential Library facility represents a significant investment that must be properly operated and maintained to prevent deterioration of the buildings and the invaluable records stored therein.  For the protection of documents which are sensitive to chemicals and atmospheric conditions, there are restrictions on the introduction of chemicals, gases, oils, etc.  Technical Evaluation Criteria:  Management Approach, Technical Understanding, Past Performance and Price.  A Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract with incorporated Department of Labor Wage Determinations is anticipated. The requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are 561210, Facilities Support Services, and the Small Business Size Standard is $6.0 Million. Copies of the RFP, which will be available on or about 2 May 2003, may be obtained through the Federal Business Opportunities web site at www.fedbizopps.gov.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor this site for the release of the solicitation and amendments, if any.  All contractors interested in receiving notification of updates/amendments to the solicitation posted on FedBizOpps are urged to enroll on the web site mailing list for this acquisition.  Those Contractors enrolled will be notified automatically of any changes made to the RFP through their e-mail addresses.  No telephone or fax RFP requests will be accepted.

Please disregard the previous solicitation number provided in the first modification. It is incorrect.*******The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Andor Technology, of South Windsor, Connecticut for one (1) each: Deep Depletion Charge Coupled Device (CCD) Camera Detector System, System Controller card, Software Developers Kit, and External Power Supply.  The CCD Detector System will be used by NIST’s Process Measurements Division (PMD) to detect Raman scattered radiation from compound semiconductors and other weakly scattering materials.  The detection of weak Raman scattered radiation is critical for the measurement of materials properties of importance to PMD research.

***Sole Source determination is based on the need for the CCD Camera System sensors to have enhanced (relative to non-deep depletion CCD sensors) spectral response in the 700 nm to 1100 nm wavelength range and to have etalon fringe pattern suppression performed during sensor fabrication.  It is essential that the fringe suppression be performed during chip fabrication in order to assure maximum uniformity of etalon fringe pattern suppression over the entire chip.  It is imperative to NIST’s research to be able to detect weak Raman signals that could masked by non-uniform fringe patterns.  Andor Technology is the only known vendor who can supply a CCD camera system that performs etalon fringe suppression during chip fabrication.
 
***Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 60 days after receipt of order.

I. 	GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS

1.	Scope of Contract.  This work is being solicited to improve habitat for the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis, herein referred to as RCW), a species Federally listed as endangered.  This work consists of the mechanical removal of hardwood midstory vegetation on 211.8 acres at the Poinsett Electronic Combat Range, South Carolina, and will occur in sites presently occupied by RCWs (active clusters), sites presently unoccupied by RCWs (inactive clusters) and forested areas used by the RCW as foraging habitat.  Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment (including safety equipment), tools, transportation, supervision, and perform all work required to remove hardwood vegetation up to 6 inches in diameter at breast height using a heavy-duty brush cutter on selected sites in forested areas in accordance with the specifications and provisions of the contract. 

2.	Description and Location.  The area to be treated is within the boundaries of the Poinsett Electronic Combat Range, Sumter County, South Carolina.  The specific project area consists of four sites of mature longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest with a pine basal area of <40 ft2 per acre and a dominant midstory of turkey oak (Quercus laevis).

3.	Boundaries.  The boundaries of the sites to be treated will be marked with orange flagging tape as depicted on a site map, which will be provided.  Areas within boundaries to be excluded also will be marked with orange flagging tape.  

4.	Explosive Objects Encountered in Contact with Work Areas.

A.	Although the sites within the project area are not known to contain unexploded ammunition or explosive devices, any military items encountered shall not be disturbed in any manner and their presence shall immediately be brought to the attention of the Base Endangered Species Biologist.

B.	Any employee or other person working within Poinsett Electronic Combat Range shall have attended a pre-work conference with the Range Operations Officer and the Base Endangered Species Biologist.

5.	Coordination.  The contractor shall coordinate closely with the Base Endangered Species Biologist concerning items such as security, access to work sites, work schedules, etc.  The contractor shall notify the Endangered Species Biologist on Thursday prior to each weekend when work is to be performed.  This notification is required so that the Endangered Species Biologist can coordinate with Range Control to schedule the closure of work areas for the safety of the contractor.

6.	Work Hours.  Work is permitted between 1300 and 1900 hours on Fridays and between 0630 and 1900 hours on Saturdays and Sundays.  Work also may be permitted between 0630and 1900 hours during the period of 22 through 26 September 2003, but this time period is subject to change or cancellation depending on the mission needs of the military.  Work during other times may be possible with the approval of the Base Endangered Species Biologist.

RCW cluster boundaries are marked with yellow, diamond shaped signs with the following wording:  “Endangered Species Site, Red-cockaded Woodpecker.”  Equipment and supplies shall not be stored within RCW clusters, and work within RCW clusters must proceed with minimal delay.  RCW cavity trees are identified by two white bands painted on the bole approximately five feet above the ground.  Damage to these trees by vehicle, brush cutter or any other means shall not be tolerated.  The contractor shall be assessed $300.00 per skinned or damaged RCW cavity tree.

B.	Erosion Control.  All equipment shall be operated in a manner causing the least possible disturbance to the soil. 

C.	Protection of Streams, Lakes and Reservoirs.  Contractor shall use every precaution necessary to prevent pollution of streams, lakes and reservoirs by fuels, oils, other chemicals, silt or other harmful materials.  All streams will be kept free of contractor-generated debris.

D.	Protection of Archeological/Historical Resources.  The contractor, upon the discovery of suspected archaeological or historical materials, shall cease work in the vicinity of such material and immediately notify the contracting officer.

E.	Protection of Soil.  Contractor shall use every precaution necessary to prevent the contamination of soils by the spills of petroleum products (oils and fuels), ethylene glycol (coolant) and other chemicals and harmful materials.  Contractor shall also be responsible for reporting all spills of the aforementioned materials immediately to the Contracting Officer or his/her representative.
		
II.  TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

Use of Heavy-duty Brush-cutting Machinery.  The project area shall be treated with heavy-duty brush-cutting machinery that chips and spreads trees.  A minimum of two machines operating simultaneously shall be used.  Machines with low ground pressure (below 3 psi) are preferred to reduce soil disturbance.

IV.  MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT

1.	Measurement.  The total size of the project area is 211.8 acres as determined using a Global Positioning System and is considered accurate.  A one-time payment will be made to the contractor upon acceptable completion of the project as outlined by the contract.  

2.	Basis for Payment.  Payment will be made at a rate up to but not to exceed unit bid price for the project as satisfactorily completed by the contractor.  Disbursement shall be made to the contractor following the completion of the work.

3.	Desired End Result.

<DESC>NA The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Research is to identify potential sources capable of manufacturing the 20mm MK149 Phalanx Cartridge.  The Government Technical Data Package contains the performance specification and top-level drawings.  The main c omponents include propellant, case, nose piece projectile, pusher plug assembly, primer, tungsten penetrator, discarding sabot, and link.  The performance requirements include Function and Casualty, Muzzle Velocity, Chamber Pressure, Action Time, Accuracy,  Environmental Conditions, and Waterproofness.  The technical data package (TDP) is classified as Ã¢Â€ÂœDistribution DÃ¢Â€Â.  Distribution Statement D means distribution authorized to the Department of Defense and U.S. DOD contractors only (Critical Techn ology)(Date of Contract Award).  This TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, (Title 22, U.S.C., Section 2751 et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C., app 2401, et seq. violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.  Disseminate IAW provisions of DoD Directive 5230.25.  Offerors must be registered with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office to obtain a copy of the top drawings (See www.dlis. dla.mil/jcp/ for instructions and information).

The Government Techn ical Data Package contains the performance specification and top-level drawings.  The main components include Brass Cartridge Case, Propellant, Projectile, Primer, and various Links.  The performance requirements include Function and Casualty, Muzzle Veloc ity, Chamber Pressure, Action Time, Accuracy, Environmental Conditions, and Waterproofness.  The Technical Data Package (TDP) is classified as 'Distribution X'; distribution is authorized to US Government Agencies and private individuals or enterprises eli gible to obtain export controlled technical data.  The Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751, et. seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C., App. 2401 et. seq., restrict distribution of the TDP.  Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. Disseminate IAW provisions of DOD Directive 5230.25.  Offerors must be registered with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office to obtain a copy of the top two drawings (See www.dlis.dla.mil/ jcp/ for instructions and information).  After receipt of required certification, request a copy of the specification and top level drawings via e-mail to vanhyftet@osc.army.mil, request must include Cage Code, Company Name, Address, phone e-mail address a nd point of contact.  A respondent to this market survey must have available the facilities and skills required to design and prove out 20mm PGU-27A/B TP, PGU-27/30A/B TP-T, and M55A2 TP cartridges.  Specific capabilities and skills required to manufacture  the 20mm PGU-27A/B, PGU-27/30A/B, and M55A2 cartridges are as follows:  Specific production capabilities required include:  case prime machine to insert the electric primer into the cartridge case; trace equipment for tracing the projectile; projectile as sembly equipment; cartridge Load, Assemble, and Pack (LAP) equipment to weigh and load propellant and insert the projectile body/assembly into the cartridge case, crimp and gage cartridge chamber height, and link and packout; and ballistic test facilities and equipment for measuring velocity, pressure, action time, time of flight, etc.  Production support equipment includes material handling systems, tool room equipment, ultrasonic test equipment, and metrology and metallurgy laboratories.  Production for t hese 20mm cartridges is very complex and requires sophisticated industrial capabilities.  Skills required to produce these cartridges include:  ammunition process/design engineers; set-up mechanics and operators familiar with the programming and operation of ammunition component sub-assembly production equipment and LAP production equipment identified above; toolmakers and machinists to support all production facilities/equipment; certified inspectors, quality control engineers, ultrasonic technicians, meta llurgists, and ballistics test personnel for in-process testing and final inspection, pack-out, First Article Test (FAT) and Lot Acceptance Test (LAT) ballistics testing, and shipment of ammunition products.  These critical skills require an extended perio d of time to acquire the job knowledge needed to manufacture and provide high quality ammunition in a timely manner.  Due to the customers demand for timely deliveries, the producers must be able to complete a First Article Test within 150 days after award  and first production to be within 180 days after award.  A respondent's production capacity must be sufficient to manufacture a total quantity of 2,000,000 cartridges per year.  All M12 links will be contractor furnished material.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking small business sources to assist the Federal Government in its responsibility for oversight and monitoring of the over 16,800 nursing homes/facilities that provide long term care.  The North American Industry Classification (NAIC) code applicable to the proposed contract requirement is 541618.

Organizations must specify a name and telephone number of a point of contact.  The address for receipt of proposals is:  CMS, Attention:  Herman Harris, Contract Specialist, Room C2-21-15, 7500 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21244-1850.

Specific requirements of the proposed contract effort considered to be necessary for successful performance are:
	Professionals with the credentials, experience and technical history and expertise to coordinate and conduct national certification or quality assurance reviews of programs or facilities that serve the elderly/geriatric and long term care population;

	Professionals with current or prior experience with the application of Federal laws, regulations, guidelines, State Operation Manual (SOM) and Federal survey protocols related to the survey and certification process for long term care;

	Adequate administrative support to support the wide range of operational procedures necessary to conduct contract tasks.

	Financial resources needed to efficiently and effectively conduct and sustain contract tasks.

	Quality assurance-internal evaluation for accuracy and consistency of results.

	Technical expertise in the development of training materials and policies and procedures and other materials as needed for the Project Officer.

In 1987, the Omnibus Reconciliation Act created the legislative basis for conducting Federal Monitoring Surveys (FMS).  Sections 1819(g)(3) and 1919(g)(3) of the Social Security Act require the Secretary to conduct Federal onsite surveys in a least five percent of a representative sample of skilled nursing facilities and in a representative sample of nursing homes in each State.

CMS intends to assemble a national team of surveyors who shall be available on both a scheduled and as-needed basis to: (1) conduct Federal Comparative surveys within two weeks to 30 days of a State survey to assess survey agency performance in the interpretation, application and enforcement of Federal requirements and conduct follow-up visits (with CO/RO discretion) and (2) respond/react in a timely and effective manner to crisis situations anywhere in the United States that endanger the health or safety of individuals in nursing homes.

Stage 1 will include the hiring the employees, training, establishing protocols, and other required programmatic activities; Stage 1 shall be completed within the first six (6) months of contract performance.

During Stage 2 the contractor will provide orientation and training for surveyors on CMS's survey policies and procedures, including investigative protocols to enhance surveyor's performance and understanding regarding the accurate application of the Long-Term Care (LTC) requirements.

In Stage 3 the contractor will conduct a series of surveys to train staff on the survey process and to evaluate the effectiveness of the survey team in conducting the process.  This may involve the participation of Regional and Central Office and contractor technical experts.  After a number of training surveys have been conducted, the contractor should recommend changes to the following: a) the methodology used to select and conduct surveys; b) the management of the administrative functions of surveying; and c) sampling methodology that will allow CMS to evaluate the effectiveness of state agency survey performance.  Additionally in Stage 3, the contractor will conduct a series of surveys that will be counted as part of CMS?s mandated workload that evaluates state agency survey performance.

Stage 4 requires that the contractor develop recommendations for revising the comparative survey methodology; deploy staff immediately for any crisis or complaint surveys; effectively utilize the data collected in stages 2, 3, and 4; and assist CMS in the development of training materials, policies procedures, and other required materials needed for Federal Monitoring Surveys (FMS) for the Project Officer.

The total period of performance of this contract is five (5) year.  It is estimated that the contractor will be required to conduct a maximum of 730 surveys over the year contract term.  Beyond the first year of contract performance it is estimated that the contractor will conduct approximately 170 surveys annually.  It is estimated that follow-up visit may be required for 60% of the facilities surveyed.  The contractor needs to develop and maintain communication and understand the interdependency of the Contracting Officer, Project Officer, CMS?s Central Office and its Regional Office Consortiums.

Some of the tasks the contractor selected will be expected to perform include:

	Ensuring the availability of qualified trained health professionals required to conduct the federal survey process on a national basis (registered nurses, medical doctors, pharmacists, dietitians, speech/occupational/physical therapists);
	Trained health Professionals must successfully complete CMS?s Long Term Care Basic Training and pass the Survey Minimum Qualifications Test
	Maintaining the skills and competencies of team members to ensure consistent application of the Long Term Care requirements;
	Coordinating survey findings and post-survey reports and materials to CMS?s Central and Regional Offices in a timely fashion; providing Regional Offices with all information necessary for enforcement action an serving as expert witness where necessary;

	Providing a total Quality Assurance system to ensure consistency and accuracy across surveyors and surveys conducted throughout the country;
	Developing training material and policies and procedures and other materials as needed by the Project Officer.
	Propose to CMS how ?crisis? situations would be responded too including assembling a survey team on short notice anywhere in the US in order to assure the health or safety of our beneficiaries.

Description

As part of market research, The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) is in the process of developing an acquisition strategy for a performance-based service contract to support Air Force Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Selection Training.  This RFI is an attempt to locate large as well as any and all types of small business capable of performing this type of requirement in an effective standardized Air Force flying training screening program at lower than current AF costs.  Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a formal solicitation nor does not constitute a current or any future Government requirement.  Any information provided to the Government is strictly voluntary and at no costs to the Government.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  The Air Force is only interested at this point in determining industry’s capabilities for the contemplated services.  To this end, private sector industry is invited to submit capability and cost information demonstrating the ability to meet any or all of the following scenarios.  Request responses be provided NLT 6 Jun 2003.

Requirement.  This acquisition is for non-personal services necessary to provide for a flying training screening program that will require evaluating approximately 1,000 students per year prior to the successful students entering Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT).  The purpose of this program is to identify those students who have the potential to complete the USAF SUPT Program.

1.  We are currently considering three alternatives (with separate location scenarios; each scenario assuming a smooth flow of students):  

A.  Flight training sites located near current SUPT locations (Enid, OK; Del Rio, TX; Wichita Falls, TX; Columbus, MS; Valdosta, GA; Milton, FL) to provide training only.  No housing or meals provided by contractor. 

B.	A single training location with training, housing and meals provided by contractor.

C.  Regional (2 – 4) training sites with training, housing and meals provided by contractor.  

2.  All alternatives will require:

A.  Access to a sufficient number of aircraft (2-seat minimum) to fly and screen approximately 1,000 students per year total; available through contractor ownership or lease; with the following preferred aircraft characteristics: 

(1)	Accommodate student weights ranging from 103 lbs. to 245 lbs
.
(2)	Accommodate student heights from 64”-77” tall and sitting heights of 34”-40”.  

B.  Capability to perform all private pilots maneuvers (except night, instrument and cross-country flights) in a 25-flight hour standardized Air Force screening syllabus (23 hours dual in 17 sorties and 2 hours solo in 2 sorties).  Assume that the students have no previous flight hours.

C.	Cost estimate offering the 25-hour flying time training program, to include all ground training and support as defined in paragraph 1A, B and C. 

D.  Sufficient infrastructure to support this workload and operations.

E.  Demonstrated operations of a professional work environment in both approach and appearance.

F.  A comparison of contractor’s safety record to the general aviation safety record.  Answer must include the contractor’s accident rate per 100,000 flight hour as a minimum.  

Alternate methods of meeting the objectives of the Air Force Flight Screening program are encouraged.

Period of Performance.  TBA

Small Business Set-Aside.  The Government reserves the right to consider a small or small disadvantaged business set aside based on responses to this notice.  For purposes of this acquisition, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 611512, Flight Training, will be used for this acquisition.  The business size standard is $21.5M.  ALL types of small business entities are encouraged to submit a response. 

Personnel and facility will have a secret clearance.  Prospective Offeror’s must have the financial backing to defray mobilization and operating costs for approximately sixty (60) to ninety (90) days.  Internet and e-mail capabilities are a must!  Registration in the Central Contract Registration (CCR) is mandatory located at www.ccr.gov.  

NOTE: Dates appearing in the notification are subject to change.

Point(s) of contact.  Forward your response to: Major Christianson at AETC/LGC (210) 652-7901 and e-mail ann.christianson@randolph.af.mil

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS. – The United States Marine Corps, Marine Corps Systems Command, seeks a vendor to develop an alternate source of supply for the autopilot and Ground Control Station software subsystems of the Dragon Eye (DE) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).   The objective of this RFI is to solicit interest from industry firms capable and interested in participating in this effort.  Dragon Eye is a five-pound modular UAV system capable of fully autonomous flight.  Made of lightweight material, the UAV is designed to disassemble into five separate pieces and be back-packable by individual Marines.  Missions are programmed via a wireless modem that is integrated into a small, lightweight ground control station.  After bungee launch, Dragon Eye flies to pre-assigned GPS waypoints, and has the ability to be reprogrammed in flight.  The UAV sensors include full motion color, low light, and in the future other sensors such as infrared cameras in interchangeable payload noses.  The system is capable of transmitting sensor and air vehicle telemetry data line-of-sight (LOS) to a range of ten kilometers.  Dragon Eye flies up to speeds of 35 mph and has a battery endurance of almost one hour.  The system is based on an evolutionary acquisition strategy which plans performance improvements in future block upgrades.  Dragon Eye’s primary mission is reconnaissance and surveillance for small unit commanders, across the battlefield functions, with an organic capability to see over the next hill/building, or conduct route reconnaissance, battle damage assessment, and unit force protection.   The autopilot must provide fully autonomous operation, GPS navigation, air vehicle stability for imagery, preprogrammed search patterns, inflight waypoint updates, and interface protocol with the GCS software and payload sensors.  The autopilot must weigh less than 4 ounces.  The GCS software must run on the current DE Ground Control Station, which uses the Panasonic Toughbook 34 laptop computer with windows 2000 operating system.   The United States Air Force’s Force Protection Airborne Surveliance System (FPASS) UAV system (air vehicle nomenclature is the Desert Hawk) currently uses a modified version of the same autopilot and software system.  The Desert Hawk air vehicle is used by Air Force Security Forces Personnel to see beyond base perimeters and add an additional layer of assessment/protection for bases throughout the world.  It is the Marine Corps’ intent to work with the Air Force Electronic Systems Center’s Force Protection C2 Program Office to integrate Desert Hawk’s functional requirements into this alternate autopilot and GCS software architecture.  MCSC will be the lead agency for this effort.  Industry firms capable of providing the required systems, in whole, are invited to submit a response to this notice.  MCSC anticipates using the GSA schedule for this opportunity although interested parties not on the GSA schedule are encouraged to participate.  Firms should identify/submit a copy of their GSA schedule (if applicable) and should also include literature, brochures, and capabilities summaries directly addressing their ability to meet the aforementioned needs.  MCSC will not pay or provide reimbursement for any costs incurred in the preparation or delivery of the requested information.  Interested firms are requested to respond NLT 6 JUN 2003, stating their business size, NAICS Code, and identifying a corporate point of contact.  Interested sources should respond to: (U. S. Mail address) Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN CT-JC, 2033 Barnett Ave., Suite 315, Quantico, VA 22134-5010. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.

<SUBJECT>D -- Direct Loan Servicing System
<DESC>Single source procurement for continued service and turnover.

The Department of Education has conducted extensive market research to fulfill its loan servicing needs between October 1, 2003 and September 30, 2007.  In performing this market research, the Department has determined that the extension to the Direct Loan Servicing System with ACS contract is appropriate.  

The Department has determined that a transition period of, at a minimum, 24 to 36 months will be necessary for any contractor to build out an infrastructure and begin processing the more than seven million borrowers in the current Direct Loan portfolio.  

The Department has completed market research for the procurement of "Common Services for Borrowers", which will absorb all loan servicing requirements for the Department.  Award of this contract is expected on or about 9/30/2003. 

The single source extension is required to allow for a reasonable transition period from the current direct loan servicer to the awardee of the "Common Services for Borrower" acquisition.

2.  Order Title:  DISN Broadband Wireless Access (DBWA) Transport system and its integration with DISN Transport  

3. Backgrounds and Introduction:  

Among other responsibilities, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Network Services Organization (NS) provides design and development engineering and RDT&E for all information transfer and network control systems managed by DISA and used in the dynamically evolving DISN and the Global Information Grid (GIG).  The Center for DISN Evolution (NS4) provides preeminent systems engineering for joint information transfer systems.  NS4 plans, evaluates, and integrates cutting edge information transport technologies into the DISN to provide information superiority services to the war fighter that satisfy requirements under all conditions.  A primary resource managed and used by the Network Services Organization is the Network Engineering Assessment Facility (NEAF).  The NEAF is used for prototype design validation, functional specification development, system transition assessment, assessment plans and procedures, development, exploratory development, feasibility assessment, and near real&#64979;time resolution of network operation problems.  It is a key element in the systems engineering process, bridging the gap between theoretical designs and actual implementation.

Worldwide demand for wireless services continues to grow rapidly.  It is expected that by 2010, more than half of all information sent in the world may use wireless communications media.  Emerging commercial wireless systems and services are becoming rich in capabilities, and many of these capabilities are becoming hard requirements within Department of Defense and military C4I architectures. Significant commercial investment has been and will continue to be made to support mobile users, and leveraging this investment for the war fighter is what this work is all about.  Wireless is clearly emerging as the mobile access segment of the DISN networks, and NS4 is working to develop a variety of DISN Wireless Services so that mobile DoD personnel can securely access the DISN anywhere and anytime.   

NS4 is evaluating Broadband (fixed) Wireless Access Transport for local loop bypass applicability, a separate technology that is vital to providing the DISN with increased diversity and reliability over the “last mile” between commercial Points of Presence and DISN nodes on Service posts, camps, and stations.  This activity to date has been at the architectural and planning levels.  It is now time to move to a hardware evaluation and integration stage, which is the purpose of this task order.

Leveraging Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) products and services, the DISN Systems Engineering Support Division (NS41) is planning to develop a proof of concept DISN Wireless Voice and Data Services pilot test bed for installation in the NEAF. The Wireless Network Services proof of concept pilot will be used to develop secure extensions and interfaces to the DISN Wireless Network Services, followed by assessment and evaluation.  This effort will allow the Defense Information Service Network (DISN) to extend its wireless services to both the strategic and tactical communities via wireless broadband communication. 




4.  Objectives and Purpose:  

Objective: The objective of the SOW is to acquire and install DISN Broadband Wireless Access Transport System as a part of the project to develop an operational proof of concept pilot. The ultimate goal is to develop and deploy a broadband global mobile DISN Service for DOD mobile users, and tactical war-fighters.

Purpose:  The purpose of the test bed is to evaluate low cost alternatives for providing the normally time consuming and expensive provision of ‘last mile’ connectivity between on-base military communications nodes and commercial nodes, as well as for contingency use during emergencies or failure of normal connectivity.  This acquisition is for a reference standard, commercial carrier grade link between the NEAF and the Columbia Pike (CPK) building via a unique hybrid or a combination of both Free Space Optical (FSO) and millimeter-wave technology. Each of the two supporting technologies has strengths but are affected by weather in different ways.  In order to assess various competing products it is necessary to have an exacting standard for comparison, and the proposed acquisition provides that reference standard, one which is designed to provide an integrated connectivity with commercial carrier grade reliability (0.99999 availability) without being affected by weather.  The assessments to be accomplished over the next few years will be in collaboration with the D-force Wireless Lab at the CPK.  The links between existing wireless applications and platforms at the CPK lab and NS wireless transport equipment in the NEAF will further give us the opportunity to assess the interoperability of diverse wireless products.  The results of these ongoing assessments will provide products that will be integrated into the GIG-BE and Defense Information Service Networks (DISN).  In addition, the effect of integrating COTS and NSA certified encryption would be assessed.

5.  Scope: 

This will be a firm, fixed price acquisition of a -commercial, off-the-shelf hardware and software in support of a wireless test bed at the DISA Network Engineering Assessment Facility (NEAF) in Skyline 7. The scope of this effort includes acquisition, installation on an existing Line of Sight Mounts (structure), followed by performance acceptance test for an operational turnkey system for the line of sight (LOS) OC12 (622 MBPS) access link between two existing Government laboratories situated within a mile of each other.

<DESC>This is an amended combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Reference Task ID 5TC5703C257.  This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The RFQ document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2001-13.  This RFQ is issued under Full and Open Competition and is unrestricted.  NAICS Code 541512, Information Management Computer Systems Integration Design Services applies.  Size Standard $21M.  The requirement is to procure Microsoft Premier Support, to include Account Management and Proactive Technical Services, Technical Support, Technical Information Services, and access to the Alliance Support Team in support of the Air Force Communications Agency (AFCA)Enterprise Network Operations Support Cell (ENOSC) located at Scott AFB, IL.  Account Management and Proactive Technical Services shall include a Technical Account Manager’s (TAM) time for proactive, technical consulting and account management services (up to 200 hours); Windows ASP’s for Alliance Support Professional for proactive, technical consulting and incident resolution (up to 100 hours); SMS ASP’s for Alliance Support Professional for proactive, technical consulting and incident resolution (up to 200 hours); Microsoft Office ASP, technical consulting and incident resolution (up to 100 hours).  The TAM/ASP hours include but are not limited to Support Consulting, Supportability Reviews, Remote Diagnosis and Debug, Multivendor Coordination, Orientation and Planning Sessions, Escalation Management, Service Delivery Plan, Support Usage Reports, Monthly Status Meetings, and TAM onsite visits.  Technical support includes up to 6 Support Incidents, Hot Fixes, Critical Problem Alerts, Multivendor Coordination and Flexible credits.  Technical Information Services includes NewsFlashes, Expert Roundtable Participation Unlimited-user Service Desk license and Microsoft TechNet Plus Subscription, Microsoft Developer Network Subscription, Flex Credit (up to 100 hours).  Alliance Support Team includes support for Windows 2000 with Active Directory; Windows XP; Windows NT; Internet Information Server; Microsoft SQL Server; Microsoft Office; Microsoft System Management Server; Microsoft Software Update Services.  The Government may have a requirement to purchase additional Flex Credits, TAM Hours and Support Incidents to be applied to any Premier/Alliance Service.  Additional flex credits shall be priced in 100 hour increments and will be funded on an “as required” basis.  To clarify the requirement, the ENOSC requires Microsoft Premier Support services to respond to questions that are beyond the ENOSC’s knowledge and abilities.  Theoretically, the magnitude of the network to be supported is the entire United States Air Force enterprise network.   Historically, the issues requiring support may range from problems found at the base level (a metropolitan area network of about 10,000 users) that typically apply to most Air Force bases; may be problems related to compatibility issues identified after installation of the latest Microsoft operating system patch or between a third party vendor's product and a Microsoft product which may require the contractor to work with the ENOSC troubleshooting the problem until resolved.  The “fix” may range from a configuration change on the computer having the problem to establishing a hot patch development requirement with Microsoft to develop a patch for the product to make it compatible with the third party product.  The contractor needs to be able to consult with the ENOSC on network architecture/configuration/security issues such as patch management and how to roll-out products that the Air Force needs to manage the architecture/configuration/security of its network.  Monthly invoices/reports shall include the monthly and cumulative hours used in each support area via email to the client and submitted electronically through ITSS to the GSA ITR.  This requirement is for a firm fixed price contract.  Delivery of all services for the base period, 22 May 2003 through 21 May 2004, and four successive one year option periods.  The actual start date, and subsequent option periods, may be adjusted at contract award.  Acceptance of all services shall be by the ITR, in coordination with the Government program manager at AFCA, Scott AFB, IL, 62225.  Award will be based on best value evaluation using criteria in the following order of importance: technical approach, staffing plan, past performance, and price.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than price.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions.
