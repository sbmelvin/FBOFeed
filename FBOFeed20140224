<p>The AFNWC/PZIC will be soliciting a 100% Total Small Business Set-Aside, Firm Fixed Price Contract to support the 377 MSG/CE mission at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. Competition will be restricted to companies with a bona fide place of business in the State of New Mexico.</p>
<p>The Government's obligation under this Pre-Solicitation and follow on Request for Proposals (RFP) is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds. No legal liability on the part of the Government for payment of any money shall arise unless, and until, funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this procurement and award has been made by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Work under this project is comprised of designing and constructing a repair to the roof of Building 1025 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The existing pitched, metal roof has exceeded its useful life. The primary goal of this project is to furnish and install a new, Standing Seam Roof (SSR) system over the existing system, anchoring it to the existing steel structure below. Estimated Period of Performance (POP) for requirement is 169 days. IAW FAR 36.204(d) the estimated price range for this requirement is between $250,000 and $500,000.</p>
<p>A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) evaluations described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.1 targeted toward a 100% Total Small Business set-a-side with a 30-day response time (offers due 30 days after issuing).</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled. Kirtland AFB plans to include the following factors:</p>
<p>1) Cost/Price<br />2) Technical Acceptability<br />3) Past Performance</p>
<p>Within the Past Performance Factor the following sub-factor will be used:</p>
<p>a) Filled out Past Performance Information Forms</p>
<p>Within the Technical Acceptability Factor the following sub-factors will be used:</p>
<p>a) Technical Approach Narrative<br />b) Proposed Progress Schedule</p>
<p>The Cost/Price factor will be afforded primary emphasis in the evaluation. All other evaluation factors other than Cost/Price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost/price.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 11 March 2014 and close on or about 30 calendar days thereafter. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation. Prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database before award of a government contract; failure to register in the SAM database may cause your firm to be ineligible for award.</p>

Mandatory Language: In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participations has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractor but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies or Services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award may be based on a combination of price, technical capability, and past performances detailed in the solicitation. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR 52.209-1. Written procedure will be used for this solicitation. No telephone requests. Only written or faxed requests received directly from the requestors are acceptable. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program (EGRP), Modifiable Risk Factors Branch (MRFB) plans to procure on a sole source basis services to pool data, create a master dataset and conduct statistical analysis for the two aims outline in this project below from Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Rd., Melbourne, Australia. <br /><br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $14.0 Million.
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance is twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>NCI/EGRP/MRFB is interested in the environmental causes of childhood cancer but it is difficult to study because cancer in children is rare and it is difficult to identify past exposure levels, particularly during important periods such as pregnancy. There is now a unique opportunity to prospectively study whether maternal folic acid supplementation affects leukemia risk in children. This data analysis project leverages on the resource of the International Childhood Cancer Cohort Consortium (I4C), a large consortium of several prospective mother-child cohorts. For this analysis, the plan is to pool data from five large prospective cohorts within the I4C. These five prospective cohorts have a combined sample size of 475,353 live births from 502,466 mothers. Approximately 200 cases of childhood leukemia and 550 cases of all cancers combined have been identified as of September 2011. Data is available on maternal folic acid supplementation as well as data to assess confounding. The goal of the proposed analysis is to test the hypothesis that folic acid supplementation in pregnant mothers reduces the risk of leukemia (acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other subtypes) in their children.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements</p>
<p>The contractor shall pool data, create a master dataset, and conduct statistical analyses for the two aims outlined in this project:</p>
<p>1. To pool data from five prospective cohort studies within I4C to investigate whether folic acid supplementation and total folic acid intake in pregnant women (n=502,466) affect subsequent risk for leukemia in their children (n=475,353), controlling for confounding factors such as folic acid fortification in participating cohorts, B-vitamins and environmental toxicants (these data are available).<br />"The hypothesis is that both folic acid supplementation as well as total folic acid intake in pregnant women will reduce the subsequent risk of leukemia in the children."<br /><br />2. To assess whether pregnancy BMI (obesity in pregnancy) is an effect modifier of the relationship between maternal folic acid intake and leukemia risk in the off-spring. The COR has previously reported on "An inverse association between obesity and fasting serum folate concentrations in women in a controlled feeding study and hypothesize that obesity in pregnancy will be an effect modifier." <br /><br />After gathering the data, the contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) a plan for the manuscript development. Upon approval of the plan, the contractor shall draft a manuscript describing the findings of the research. This will include all conventional subsections (i.e., Introduction/Background, Methods, Results, Discussion). The contractor shall then send the draft to the COR for review, who will incorporate feedback and suggestions into a second draft, and will submit the completed manuscript to NCI for internal review. The manuscript will be used by the NCI in the development of the final report.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide adequate and appropriate staff, equipment, supplies, and space facilities necessary for carrying out the requirements of the statement of work. The contractor shall be responsible for developing the analysis plan and writing up the results.</p>
<p>Government Responsibilities</p>
<p>NCI program staff will review draft deliverables for review and approval. NCI will also provide the funding required for the contractor to perform the tasks outlined in this document.</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables</p>
<p>The contractor shall prepare the deliverables in accordance with the following schedule:</p>
<p>1) Analysis plan June 30, 2014<br />2) Data analysis December 31, 2014<br />3) First draft of manuscript describing results January31, 2015<br />4) Second draft of manuscript March 31, 2015<br /><br />Since the Murdoch Children Research Institute is the only institution that houses the data from the International Childhood Cancer Cohort Consortium (I4C), a consortium of several large-scale prospective cohort studies, it is determined that they are the only source that can provide the data to complete the project.</p>

<DESC><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The objective of this Market Research is to gain further understanding of the capabilities available to meet the requirements of the Aircraft and Communications Subsystems of the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System Recapitalization (JSTARS Recap) system</span></em>. Gaining this understanding will allow the Government to finalize the acquisition strategy and plan for necessary risk reduction work.
<p><br />The JSTARS Recap system will recapitalize the Joint STARS Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)/Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) Mission Area capability on a significantly smaller and more efficient airframe (business jet class) thereby reducing the life cycle costs of the weapon system. This implementation will utilize Open Systems Architecture (OSA) to ensure future competition, which will enable new capability to be added more quickly and more affordably throughout its lifecycle.</p>
<p>The JSTARS Recap system is an airborne Command and Control, Intelligence Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) system designed to provide near real-time surveillance and targeting information on moving and stationary ground and surface (maritime) targets. The system also detects slow moving, rotary, and fixed-wing aircraft, and rotating antennas, and has the ability to observe dismounted (personnel on foot) targets. The radar possesses moving target indicator (MTI) and SAR modes. The system is designed for worldwide deployment and continuous 24 hour, all weather operation.</p>

<DESC>Request for information: Sources Sought/Quotes Sought <br> NAICS Code: 541 -Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services/541712 -Research and Development in the physical, engineering, and Life Sciences  <br> Preservation/Stabilization of selected Amino Acids by Encapsulation <br> BACKGROUND: <br> The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Combat Feeding Directorate, is actively developing ration components fortified with free amino acids.  Free amino acids possess less than desirable flavor profiles which can oxidize and readily react with reducing sugars in the non-enzymatic Maillard reaction to form browning products.  This reaction degrades amino acids and decreases availability for absorption.  Therefore, this research seeks to stabilize amino acids through encapsulation techniques, investigating viable approaches for encapsulating amino acids, acquiring and testing samples, and then down selecting for incorporation into rations. <br> Encapsulated amino acids will be incorporated into selected ration components with storage requirements of 6 months at 100oF and 3 years at 80oF.    Free amino acids such as glutamine, tyrosine and arginine are being considered for encapsulation. Potential ration components include powdered beverages (Aw ~0.3), energy bars (Aw 0.4-0.53) or other unidentified but similarly suitable specialty items.   <br> SOURCES SOUGHT:   <br> The NSRDEC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for research and development of (1-3) encapsulation systems to preserve and stabilize the three individual amino acids mentioned above.  The NSRDEC plans to issue a request for proposal for Science and Engineering Services and is hereby soliciting information about potential sources and is seeking capability statements from all interested parties. Encapsulated amino acids must meet performance requirements such as: 1) be nearly stable and functional (demonstrate less than a 10-15% loss, as shown with analytical recovery tests) at the end of the two required storage periods,  2) the encapsulate must breakdown in the body for adequate absorption of amino acids within the GI tract (as shown using in vitro digestion model/analytical recovery tests), and  3) sensory characteristics such as, color, flavor and texture must be acceptable within a food matrix during the storage period.   A specific example, would be, that the encapsulated amino acids have acceptable mouth-feel/texture characteristics while providing the necessary protection for long term storage. <br> For established or proven encapsulation systems please provide a description of materials, processes, functionality/properties and successful applications.    For untested ideas please provide proposed materials, processes and expected functionality/properties and applications.   <br> The level of technical risk, level of experience and previous success will be taken into consideration.   Qualified vendors shall demonstrate experience and capability in performing encapsulation techniques required for the aforementioned amino acids.    They shall have all required equipment (must be processed under food grade conditions) to successfully encapsulate chosen amino acids.  <br> QUOTES SOUGHT: <br> To summarize, the project will most likely involve several small test batches to determine optimal coating levels and types followed by 1-3 larger productions for more involved product R&D and storage studies to determine if the items meet military shelf life requirements.  For established or proven encapsulation systems please provide a quote for producing several small ( less than  5 lbs.) batches for analysis and pre-testing, and a quote for producing larger ( greater than  10 lbs.) batch(es) for ration development.   For unproven ideas please provide an estimated cost for each individual amino acid test production.   <br> ______________________________________________________________________________ <br> The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) for this is notice is 541712, Other Research and Development in Physical Engineering, and Life Sciences (Except Biotechnology) with a size standard of 500 employees.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN-20 VA Healthcare System is requesting information related to vendors capable of providing Intraoperative Neurophysiologic Monitoring including SSEP servicing the Portland Veterans Medical Center (PVAMC).
 This is not a request for bids, quotes, or proposals.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT announcement only. The purpose of this notice is to conduct market research and obtain information from qualified businesses. The responses to this announcement will assist in determining the socio-economic set aside if feasible. The Veterans Administration is required by Public Law 104-9 to give first priority to SDVOSB and VOSB concerns if there should be sufficient firms available to compete under a set aside. If insufficient veteran owned and small business response is received to establish the basis for setting this action aside for other than large business participation then the action will be advertised as full and open competition, in which case, all interested parties responding shall be eligible to bid.
 This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.
 
 The vendors are requested to respond to the requirements for 
 Requirements: 
This requirement is for Intraoperative Neurophysiologic Monitoring including SSEP servicing the Portland Veterans Medical Center (PVAMC). SSEP is evoked potential caused by a physical stimulus (usually a small electric pUlse). Electrodes positioned over particular areas of the body record responses of the SSEP. These are then observed as a reading on an electroencephalogram (EEG1. A SSEP can most commonly involve stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist or the posterior tibial nerve at the ankle. This investigation therefore tests the pathway of the sensory nerves to the sensory areas of the brain, even though the stimuli are non-physiological.

The proposed acquisition is for one year base period and four additional option periods for a total period of performance of five years including the option.
Interested parties should submit with their response the following information no later than 7 March 2014 at 1100 MST and include POC information, business size, business SBA classification(s), DUNS number. All questions should be addressed to Paul Richardson at 208-429-2016 or Paul.Richardson2@va.gov.

<p>Within the Federal government, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is tasked with protecting the civilian population by providing leadership in research, development, acquisition, deployment, and use of effective medical countermeasures to treat the adverse health effects resulting from intentional exposure to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat agents, pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases.</p>
<p>The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic exemplified the unpredictability and rapidity with which a novel influenza strain can impact the world's population. With a historic effort from both Government and industry partners, vaccines were developed and available to the public six months after the initial outbreak. Despite high infection rates, the 2009 H1N1 virus was only mildly pathogenic, with relatively low rates of accompanying morbidity and mortality in the general population. However, it is possible that future pandemics will feature morbidity and mortality rates comparable with more severe pandemics such as 1957. The ever-present and ever-evolving threat of pandemic influenza presents a compelling need for the federal government to optimize preparedness using medical countermeasures currently available in the marketplace and to develop innovation in the prevention and treatment of influenza disease.</p>
<p>Mechanical ventilators are a critical life-saving non-pharmaceutical medical countermeasure for patients experiencing respiratory failure that could result from the consequences of a pandemic influenza, emerging infectious disease or other chemical, biological or radiological event. These events can quickly overwhelm the hospital resources of the locale and the region. In a public health emergency resulting in respiratory failure for a large number of patients, hospitals will need to surge the medical capabilities needed to provide mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p>Requirement:<br />The Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are seeking information from the manufacturing community on mechanical ventilator products and manufacturing capabilities that serve all members of the U.S. population, including the general adult population, children, elderly individuals, pregnant women, diabetic individuals, individuals with mental and physical disabilities, the immune-compromised, hyper-allergenic individuals and those with pre-existing medical conditions.</p>

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow up information requests.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit Capability Statements via email to Janet Mata-Hitz at jmata@loc.gov and carbon copy Shameema Rhaman at srah@loc.gov.</p>
<p>Capability statements should be limited to no longer than 10 pages and include the following information:</p>
<p>1) Company Name, DUNS Number, Address, Point of Contact, phone number and email address;<br />2) Corporate structure (corporation, LLC, sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability partnership, professional corporation, etc.);<br />3) References, including name, phone number and email address of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses;</p>
<p>4) A statement as to whether the firm is interested in working as a prime contractor or a subcontractor;<br />5) "A demonstration of the vendor's technology and its ability to meet LC's objectives. (See Item III, Capability Statements and Item IV, Sample Response Outline.)</p>
<p>II. Background</p>
<p>1. Overview</p>
<p>Cataloger's Desktop ("Desktop") is a searchable information delivery system consisting of 300+ pre-selected information resources. Cataloger's Desktop's objective is to help library professionals quickly find the information they need to create bibliographic metadata for incoming library resources.</p>
<p>The service's target audience is library staff working in cataloging areas. Cataloger's Desktop is currently used by approximately 10,000 librarians at roughly 1,000 institutions. Most users hold advanced degrees in library and information science; however, subscribers' computer experience varies widely. It is therefore very important that the user experience be as intuitive as possible.</p>
<p>The Library of Congress (LC) is seeking capability statements from vendors who can support:</p>
<p>1. Desktop's maintenance and hosting (production)<br />2. Multiple discrete product improvements (above current capabilities).</p>
<p><br />2. General Functional Architecture</p>
<p>The main Cataloger's Desktop design components are currently comprised of:<br /><br />a. Subscription management system. The current system allows subscriptions to be managed at the institution level. This includes the ability of LC personnel to add and remove subscriptions. It also includes the provision for each institution to setup and manage its own users.</p>
<p>b. Data store. A current Host and Delivery System supports 300+ resources, and has the ability to add/delete/update resources as they are identified. The current system deploys to HTML, XML, Folio InfoBase, MS Word, MS Power Point, PDF or XPS resources in a web browser. Although most of these resources are hosted on the Cataloger's Desktop server, some reside on their native servers and are accessed using Desktop as a gateway.</p>
<p>c. User interface (U-I). The user interface supports routine cataloging / metadata creation activity by providing easy navigating and consistent functional steps. For example, printing, copying, searching, and bookmarking follow the same steps regardless of where the user is in Desktop.</p>
<p><br />III. Capability Statement</p>
<p>The capability statement should briefly describe the company's expertise, experience, and understanding of the following areas:</p>
<p>a. Production Support:</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to perform routine maintenance, such as applying software patches, daily system backups, system performance monitoring, and disaster recovery.</p>
<p>&bull; The ability to support the 300+ resources in Desktop and crawl them for updates on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis.</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to provide updates for 36 resources which are processed from Folio infobase markup to XML markup.</p>
<p>&bull; The ability to provide servers located at an Internet co-location facility that provides system and application monitoring, backups, redundancy and failover, and hosting bureau service, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. System availability should be maintained at no less than 99.95% over a one year period.</p>
<p>b. Types of Product Improvements Sought:</p>
<p>The following possible system enhancements have been identified by LOC:</p>
<p>&bull; Resource Administration - An administrative feature that would enable LC staff to add, remove, or edit knowledgebase resources.</p>
<p>&bull; Customizable Menu - A feature that would allow end-users to setup and save customized menus.</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to rank and comment on resources - System that provides end-users with the ability to rank and comment on individual resources. Rankings and comments could be shared with other users.</p>
<p>&bull; Mobile Client - User interface optimized for tablets (e.g., iPads) for the Android and/or iOS operating systems.</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor Recommended Enhancements - Based on your experience, recommend any system enhancements that you feel will improve the heuristics of Cataloger's Desktop.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice does not prescribe a design, except to express an expectation that Cataloger's Desktop will be built based on the functionality of the existing system, will continue on-going production uninterrupted, and evolve as new technologies and designs are identified and implemented.</p>
<p>The central product design should be focused on the end user. Resource content must be updatable on at least a quarterly basis. System design must also be modular so that additional resources can be easily added, edited or removed by LC staff.</p>
<p><br />IV. Sample Response Outline</p>
<p>Following is a suggested outline for Respondents to use in submitting their capability statements and for oral presentation, if invited.</p>
<p>a. A description/diagram of the major steps/components the proposed internet technology used to search and archive designated sites.

The DHA serves as program manager for the TRICARE military health program.</p>
<p>DHCAPE supports performance-based decision making for the DHCA by applying appropriate scientific methods and operational support.  DHCAPE uses a multidisciplinary approach to investigate complex issues in measuring, evaluating and analyzing the performance of healthcare delivery systems and developing innovative methods for providing high quality health care to over 9.7 million beneficiaries worldwide, and extends from theater medical care for deployed forces to peacetime healthcare supporting active duty, family members, Guard and Reserves, former spouses, foreign nationals, et al.</p>
<p>TMA, predecessor of the DHA organization, established the TOC in late 1999, introducing a central information center providing near real-time standard access to care reports for medical commanders and decision makers throughout the MHS.  The TOC delivers meaningful, easy to use, web-based operational reports that help the MHS manage healthcare services.  The reports provide a centralized collection of CHCS, MDR, and M2 data through a web-based report suite.  The TOC retrieves data from the MDR Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) server landing zone which receives automatic transfers of select business data from all Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) CHCS hosts on a nightly basis.  The data is then processed, not altered, and displayed via standardized reports.  These reports transform and aggregate MTF data into useful management information, and make the results available at every level of the organization through a series of graphical and tabular reports.    The TOC has been manned by contract personnel since its inception since the services needed are not inherently governmental functions. <br /> <br />DHCAPE receives special data and report requests, outside the normal standard reports provided on the TOC website, from a variety of sources including internal staff and other DHA organizations in the form of data pulls from CHCS, MDR, or the M2.  All requests for data and special reports will be submitted to and approved through DHCAPE leadership.  DHCAPE may receive requests for data analysis of data pulled in order to ensure data quality.  This data analysis may include short term, quick response tasks as well as longer term data analyses.<br />3.0	Information Requested<br />This RFI is being used to collect information about capability of qualified vendors to provide support in the management of the daily operations of the TOC providing DHCAPE with data extraction, data analysis and reporting in management of the MHS direct care system.

<DESC>NASA/LARC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for a TEAMING OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A DELTA-SIGMA MODULATION BASED MULTI-WAVELENGTH PHOTODETECTION DEMONSTRATION SYSTEM This partnering synopsis solicits potential partners to participate in developing a proposal addressing the goals and objectives of NASA Research Announcement (NRA) NNH13ZDA001N, Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences.  The NRA can be accessed at:  <A HREF="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/solicitations.do?method=open&stac k=push">http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/solicitations.do?method=open&st ack=push </A>  .  <p> Participation in this partnering synopsis is open to all categories of U.S. and non-U.S. organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit institutions, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as NASA Centers and other U.S. Government Agencies.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Other Minority Universities (OMUs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBzone small businesses, and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) are encouraged to apply.  Participation by non-U.S. organizations is welcome but subject to NASAs policy of no exchange of funds, in which each government supports its own national participants and associated costs. <p> In response to the NASA Research Announcement (NRA) NNH13ZDA001N, partners are sought for the development of a proposal that is focused on the design, development, and execution of a technology demonstration mission to improve the technology readiness for delta-sigma modulation based, multi-wavelength, laser detection system. <p> The ability to detect multiplexed and weak optical signals within a single integrated package decreases the amount of overhead volume and power required in an optical receiver as well as lowering the required power for the laser transmission system. One of the challenges of detecting multiple laser wavelengths is the complexity of deflecting the optical information to a detector which responds to the corresponding optical wavelength. Another is the ability to detect very low optical intensities. Providing this capability will have the effect of reducing required laser power for a given detection range or increasing detection range for a given laser power. This technology will demonstrate the system efficiencies resulting from the detection of low intensity optical signals of multiple wavelengths. <p> A brief video discussion of the basic concept may be viewed at: <A HREF="https://sites-e.larc.nasa.gov/larctechnology/whate-were-thinking/delta-sigma-modula tion-photo-detection-method/">https://sites-e.larc.nasa.gov/larctechnology/whate-were-thi nking/delta-sigma-modulation-photo-detection-method/ </A> <p> The goal of the technology demonstration is to help develop and demonstrate an advanced laser detection system that can confidently replace or enhance present missions based on laser measurements.  This technology demonstration requires three significant elements in order to be fully successful, including; <p> (1)	Refinement of Present Electronics Design:  The present embodiment consists of a single signal channel intended for elementary proof-of-concept demonstration under nominal conditions: a room-temperature, laboratory environment. The design needs to be optimized for environmental variations such as temperature, vibration, and platform movement as well as configured for bump-bonding of multi-wavelength photodetectors. The design is expected to be silicon or silicon-germanium based with supply voltages no greater than 5V and preferably 3.3V. <p> (2)	Control Software:  The system is semi-autonomous but requires provisions for user-control of clock frequency and window length. <p> (3)	System Interface Test and Operation Software:  The output of the proposed system is a per-channel serial sequence of pulses form which the desired measurement information is contained within the number of pulses within a given clock-synchronized period of time. This information needs to be configured in a manner suitable for quasi-real-time presentation and storage. It is expected that the specific parameters will be defined during the course of project development <p> Potential partners are requested to indicate specifically their interest in partnering with NASA LaRC on NNH13ZDA001N. LaRC will consider partners with the proven capability to support any one or more of the required elements described above.  <p> If selected through this synopsis, it is expected that the selected partner(s) will work with NASA LaRC scientists and engineers to jointly develop the proposal.  If the proposal is selected, NASA LaRC anticipates issuing contracts or other agreements to the selected partner(s) for performance of the proposed work. <p> This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts or other agreements, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited.	It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules, and cost estimates. <p> Partner selections will be made by LaRC based on the listed criteria, in the following order of importance: <p> (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability, and key personnel availability to support the technology demonstration described above.  This criterion evaluates the proposers relevant recent experience, past performance in similar technology demonstration activities, technical capability to perform the demonstration, and key personnel available to support the demonstration.  Substantive evidence of successful participation in similar demonstrations should be included. <p> (2) Cost and schedule control.	This criterion evaluates the proposers ability to fit within the cost constraint of the NRA and to control both cost and schedule.  The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar demonstration programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. Given the cost constraint and guidance on cost-sharing for this demonstration, the ability of the proposer to provide low-cost, innovative solutions for the technology demonstration and to facilitate potential cost-sharing approaches are of special interest. <p> (3) Facilities.  This criterion evaluates the proposers facilities (development, testing, analysis, and operations) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed work.	The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. <p> NASA will not reimburse organizations for the cost of submitting information in response to this synopsis.  NASA will not pay for technical assessment or proposal preparation costs incurred by the team members. <p> RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS:	 <p> The response shall be limited to 15 pages in not less than 12-point font.  Responses must address the aforementioned evaluation criteria.  <p> All responses shall be submitted to LaRC electronically via email by 5:00pm EDT on March 6, 2014 to Brad Gardner (robert.b.gardner@nasa.gov) and David McGlone (thomas.d.mcglone@nasa.gov). Technical and programmatic questions should be directed to David McGlone (thomas.d.mcglone@nasa.gov) and procurement questions should be directed to Brad Gardner (robert.b.gardner@nasa.gov).

<p><strong>Introduction<br /></strong>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice set aside for 8(a) small businesses. This is <strong>NOT</strong> a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified 8(a) small business sources; (2) what type of 8(a) small business; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered an 8(a) small business under NAICS code 541611 should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>The Information Technology Applications Center (ITAC) is a branch of the Office of Management of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). ITAC provides a full range of IT support services to the Institute including custom software development, customization and deployment of COTS products, management of the NHLBI IT infrastructure, and management of the Institute's IT Security policy. ITAC collaborates very closely with the NIH Center for Information Technology in many of its functions and serves a set of customers ranging from researchers in the Division of Intramural Research, to scientists managing a scientific grant portfolio, to personnel supporting the administrative aspects of the Institute's operations.</p>
<p>To support the delivery of services to its customers, NHLBI has awarded five blanket purchase agreements (BPA) to contracting companies and is currently operating nine task orders issued under those BPAs, along with a separate contract for network/system operations, help desk services, IT security, and communications. In order for ITAC to operate effectively and efficiently, the Office of the Chief Information Officer requires a range of services provided by a contractor that can act as a trusted advisor to the government without any organizational conflict of interest, separate and independent from the existing contract holders. These services include:<br />&bull; Enterprise Architecture<br />&bull; Acquisitions Support<br />&bull; Independent Verification and Validation<br />&bull; Customer Relationship Management<br />&bull; Quality Assurance <br />&bull; IT Operation and Security Policy</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise Architecture<br /></strong>As practiced at the NHLBI, Enterprise Architecture (EA) is focused on providing guidance to the contractors performing work, particularly in the definition of Solution Architectures addressing specific requirements. This focus is driven by several needs including:<br />&bull; Providing NHLBI with innovative solutions that will serve the Institute needs now and in the future<br />&bull; Helping to minimize long-term operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs for the Institute through ensuring that the architectures and technologies applied to solutions delivery are as consistent across solutions as is reasonable. <br />&bull; Ensuring that solutions are in line with Federal, HHS, and NIH standards</p>
<p>The EA program therefore requires some aspects of the traditional EA program - ensuring that the business, information, application and technical architectures align with NHLBI's strategic goals, but is primarily focused on enabling innovative, effective, and efficient delivery of solutions to NHLBI staff. In addition, the EA program has an assurance function to insure compliance of solution delivery projects with the ITAC technology architecture standards, along with management of an appropriate architectural waiver process.</p>
<p>The EA program will work hand in hand with Customer Relationship Managers (CRMs) under this contract to operate the NHLBI IT Pilot program, a program designed to allow NHLBI staff to experience new technology and IT tools in a manner that can guide procurement decisions through the use of a rigorous Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) process. This Pilot program is about more than cost savings to the Institute as ITAC intends to work closely and collaboratively with the CRMs and NHLBI customers to research and expose technology solutions that would not normally be considered. These may provide cost-savings, increases in quality, innovation, and/or fill gaps in the technology landscape. The program will also demonstrate scalability in both the solution as well as the process to get to the solution. In addition, the contractor will work closely with the CRMs and customers to define measurable success criteria for Pilot Programs and define and recommend weighted criteria for each AoA.</p>
<p>Given the role of NHLBI's EA program in guiding contractors and federal staff through the development and implementation of EA standards which often include Analyses of Alternatives among commercial and open-source products, the awardee will be called upon to define, recommend, and provide acquisition process support to assist with the development of statements of work and quality assurance surveillance plans, along with support for other procurement related activities. This role in acquisitions is designed to ensure that the Institute procures services and products that best serve the needs of the Institute.</p>
<p><strong>Independent Verification and Validation<br /></strong>Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) is a systems engineering discipline to assist contractors responsible for development build quality into the application software during the product life cycle. Validation is concerned with checking that the product meets the user's needs, and Verification is concerned with checking that the product is well-engineered. Independent V&amp;V is the set of verification and validation activities performed by an agency not under the control of the organization that is developing the software. IV&amp;V services must be provided and managed by an organization that is technically and managerially independent of the subject product. This independence takes two mandatory forms. First, technical independence requires that the IV&amp;V services provider not organizationally be or have been, nor use personnel who are or were, involved in the software development or implementation effort, or for that matter participated in the project's initial planning and/or subsequent design. Such technical independence helps insure every IV&amp;V review report is free of personal or professional bias, posturing, or goldplating. Secondly, managerial independence is required of the IV&amp;V services provider to insure that the IV&amp;V effort is vested in an organization departmentally and hierarchically separate from the software development and program management organizations. Such managerial independence helps insure that the IV&amp;V service provider is able to deliver to Federal executive leadership and management, findings and recommendations of an IV&amp;V review without restriction, fear of retaliation, or coercion (e.g., reports being subject to prior review or approval from the development group before release to outside entities, such as the Federal government.)</p>
<p><strong>Customer Relationship Management<br /></strong>Establishing and maintaining strong customer relationships is a hallmark of a successful IT program. ITAC seeks to enhance our Customer Relationship Management program by providing experienced team members in the areas of research, grants, science, and administration to support tactical communications, outreach, adoption of technology, and coordination of technology efforts both within and external to ITAC. This will play a vital role in ensuring that ITAC's customers are heard, informed, and collaborated with. CRM's will support tactical communications related to ITAC activities; help support OM's Strategic Communications Plan; support the Pilot Programs and AoA activities with EA; intake, respond to, and follow up on customer requests; and generally serve as a liaison between ITAC and NHLBI.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Assurance<br /></strong>In order to ensure that contractors providing services to ITAC are producing deliverables with high quality, ITAC is establishing a Quality Assurance program based on ISO9000 principles. The program will include processes for reviewing and recommending approval of documents against defined quality standards, the review of software deliverables prior to acceptance into the NHLBI Integration Environment, testing of the integration of software with other software components and end to end functional, usability and performance testing for final acceptance of deliverables which may include some level of user based acceptance testing.</p>
<p><strong>Information Technology Operation and Security Policy<br /></strong>In order to protect the NHLBI IT Infrastructure, ITAC operates an IT Security program in conjunction with the NIH Center for Information Technology (CIT) and the NIH Incident Response Team (IRT). The program includes IT Security Strategy, policy development, compliance auditing and security operations including incident response. In order to remain compliant with Federal regulations, the contract will be required to assist the NHLBI ISSO and other security and management staff to ensure compliance with all NHLBI, NIH, HHS, and Federal security regulations and policies.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements<br /></strong>Specific project requirements are anticipated to be in accordance with the attached DRAFT Statement of Work.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance <br /></strong>Base Period: May 2014 - April 2015<br />Option Period 1: May 2015 - April 2016<br />Option Period 2: May 2016 - April 2017<br />Option Period 3: May 2017 - April 2018<br />Option Period 4: May 2018 - April 2019</p>
<p><strong>Conflict of Interest Exclusion<br /></strong>The NHLBI has determined that performance of this contract may create an actual or apparent Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) for the awardee, to include all divisions of the prime contractor and its subcontractors, in the event that that the awardee solicit, propose, or perform under future contracts with the NHLBI, including both IT and non-IT requirements. NHLBI has determined that performance of this contract could (1) allow the awardee to set biased ground rules for future NHLBI contracts by, for example, influencing the statement of work or specifications; (2) allow the awardee unequal access to nonpublic information that may provide the awardee a competitive advantage for future NHLBI contracts; and (3) cause impaired objectivity should the contract require the awardee to assess its own performance under another contract or through the evaluation of proposals.</p>
<p>Thus, all potential awardees for this Statement of Work must thoroughly review and adhere to FAR Subpart 9.5 "Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest". In addition, the following provision shall be included in the solicitation and any subsequent contract: <br /><br />"The awardee, to include all divisions of the prime contractor and its subcontractors, will be prohibited from delivering supplies/systems or performing services, as either prime contractor or subcontractor, for any requirements related to Statements of Work grown out of this contract. In addition, the awardee, to include all divisions of the prime contractor and its subcontractors, will be excluded from performing or being awarded any other contracts with NHLBI, IT or non-IT, for one year following the last day of contract performance, inclusive of all exercised option periods."</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this exclusion is to ensure that no actual or apparent OCI occurs and therefore the terms of this provision are non-negotiable.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) within the Colorado Springs Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which contains Fort Carson and the U.S. Air Force Academy. <br>  <br> Provide your responses NLT COB Monday, March 10th, 2014 to donna.r.larson@usace.army.mil. Provide your contact information, and ensure your response is limited to five (5) pages. <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement between a Prime contractor and one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor, or certain subcontractors, engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement; Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.  <br>  <br>  <br> Request responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> (1) Should a PLA be executed on selected large dollar contracts in the Colorado Springs MSA, which contains Fort Carson and the U.S. Air Force Academy? <br> (2) Are there concerns by Prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? <br> (3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br> (4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses? <br> (5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA? <br> (6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA? <br> (7) What is the time impact of a PLA on a solicitation response? <br> (8) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in selected Omaha District Corps of Engineers contracts?

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT - This is a Sources Sought only. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District intends to issue a Request for Quote for Oxygen Releasing Compound (ORCTM). An in situ application of an ORC-A<sup>TM</sup> product is planned for the area up-gradient of a monitoring well with persistent low level vinyl chloride detections. The purpose of this in situ injection is to optimize the degradation processes occurring in the subsurface to enable groundwater remediation goals to be achieved and site close out to occur. ORC-A<sup>TM</sup> is a compound composed of calcium oxyhydroxide, calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate and phosphates that is designed to release 17% of oxygen by weight when hydrated over a 12 month period. The ORC-A <sup>TM</sup>comes in a powder form (-325 mesh or 44 micron screen) that is mixed with water in ration of 1 lb to 1/3 gallon of water to form thin slurry. The slurry is injected using a single stroke geoprobe 1000 single hydraulic piston pump with a flow rate from 0.9 to 2.3 gpm up to 1000 psi.
<p>Also for</p>
<p>Hydrogen Releasing Compound (HRCTM). The purpose of this product is to optimize the biodegradation processes occurring in the subsurface to enable groundwater remediation goals to be achieved and site close out to occur. Approximately 2600 lbs of HRC<sup>TM</sup> will be injected into the subsurface (60 locations) using direct push technologies by CESAS in house personnel.HRC&reg; is a proven technology for this type of remediation and is significantly less expensive than other groundwater treatment systems for removing TCE contamination. HRC&reg; is an electron donor material that, when hydrated, is specifically designed to produce lactic acid over a 12-18 month period with a single application. HRC is unique in that it is composed of a proprietary polylactate esther compound to produce lactic acid, the most efficient organic acid for promoting anaerobic bioremediation of chlorinated solvents in groundwater and saturated soils.</p>
<p>Interested firms should have 541620 among their approved NAICS Codes. All interested contractors have until February 28, 2014 at 12:00 PM (EST) to submit your company's name, NAICS, technical qualifications, and business size. Submittals will only be accepted via email to Nikisha.Weston@usace.army.mil</p>

<CONTACT>Marlene L. Eubanks, Contract Specialist, Phone 7034328730, Email marlene.eubanks@usmc.mil - Mark R. Sanderson, Contract Specialist, Phone 7034328734, Email mark.sanderson@usmc.mil
<DESC><p>Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) is interested in assessing industry capabilities, technology and best practices for an Operational Environment Simulator (OES). The OES is conceptually similar to the Immersive Infantry Trainers currently in use aboard Marine Corps Bases; however, the OES will be intended primarily to support R&amp;D of Marine Corps equipment in an operationally relevant environment.</p>
<p>The Marine Expeditionary Rifle Squad (MERS) office at MCSC conducts the integration and configuration management of everything worn, carried or consumed by the Marine Rifle Squad and the integration of the combat equipped Marine into mobility platforms. MERS operates the Gruntworks Squad Integration Facility as an R&amp;D integration and modernization laboratory. The OES is one of a variety of tools that will be used for the Marine Squad. The purpose of the OES&nbsp;is to determine the operational characteristics of combat equipped Marines in a relevant environment.</p>
<p>The OES will simulate three environments for the AFRICOM, CENTCOM and PACOM theaters of operations. It is anticipated that the OES will replicate unique urban and suburban physical building structure atttributes for each of the three geographic environments, as if Marines were actually in each environment. Appearance, aesthetics, and other attributes should provide the aspect of actually entering an occupied space. The design will include structural integrity to support combat equipped Marines to negotiate every aspect of the physical environment to include crawling through a window, clearing up stairs to a second floor, and climbing over walls. All three distinct areas will be controlled in a centralized location. Human factors data collection will require ability to see and record Marines in every area for analysis.</p>
<p>There are two secondary purposes for the OES. First, the OES will serve as an experimentation test bed for evaluating future training technologies for PM Training Systems based in Orlando FL. Second, the OES will also be used as an alternative training site for the Infantry Officers Course at Quantico VA. The OES is unique in that it will require the power and data capabilities to support the insertion of new training technologies and collect relevant data on their performance characteristics.</p>
<p>The OES will be located within The Gruntworks Squad Integration Facility, a Butler Style building composed of girders and sheet metal with a solid concrete foundation and a 12 x 12 foot high bay door. The intent is to have a flooring surface suitable for safe negotiation of the OES as well as lighting that replicates the range from direct sunlight to different starlight conditions. There is no intent to control the temperature or humidity in the OES.</p>
<p>The human factors data collection in the facility is a critical function in order to collect and process the Marines movements in the OES. Recording a Marine's movements throughout the simulator is required. The OES should have avatars that are capable of interacting with Marines and support Marines using and firing non-kinetic and non-tethered OES weapons. The desire is be able to capture data on shot placement and record the engagement cycle.</p>
<p>MCSC will be conducting an industry day&nbsp;to provide interested firms the opportunity to understand the concept and vision of the OES, view the structure in which the OES will be placed, appreciate the provisions for power available, and gain an understanding of Government Furnished Material that could be made available. Drawings may be made available at the industry day. The industry day also will provide industry the opportunity to provide input and comments to the Government to assist in refining the Statement of Objectives (SOO), and to provide rough order of magnitude cost estimates that will assist in refining the scope of the project.</p>
<p>A limited number of individual sessions can be arranged with the acquisition team to discuss company-specific ideas and concerns. Such one-on-one sessions will not exceed 30 minutes each and should include company qualifications and best practice ideas relevant to the OES.</p>
<p>The industry day will be conducted on 18 March 2014 at the Gruntworks Squad Integration Facility on Marine Corps Base Quantico, Building 24017, Gilbert Road, Camp Barrett, Quantico VA. Companies wishing to attend the industry day and/or meet on a one-on-one basis should register by no later than <br />10 March 2014, 3:00 PM Local Time, by emailing Marlene Eubanks at marlene.eubanks@usmc.mil. Firms must include company name and address; names, phone numbers and email of individuals attending, whether attendees are U.S. citizens, and whether the firm desires a one-on-one meeting at the industry day. Each&nbsp;participating firm is limited to five individual attendees.&nbsp; Questions regarding this notice should be directed to Marlene Eubanks at marlene.eubanks@usmc.mil.</p>
<p>Interested parties may also submit capabilities and experience descriptions, best practice information, and any information regarding commercial contractual arrangements. Firms should include business size information. This information should be submitted to marlene.eubanks@usmc.mil no later than <br />10 March 2014, 3:00 PM Local Time.</p>

Background/Requirements

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Information Technology (IT) has identified a need for Identity and Access Management (IAM) as enterprise level services to support the VA IT systems.  IAM encapsulates people, processes and products to identify and manage the data used in an information system to authenticate users and grant or deny access rights to data and system resources.  One of the goals of IAM is to support a common mechanism for allowing beneficiaries, employees and other interested parties (e.g. providers) to transact business digitally with VA.  This will be accomplished through the implementation of a digital signature solution in which a signing device will be utilized. 


Please provide if your company is capable of providing first line support for Maintenance and Support for ArX CoSign Central Devices.

The Government requests that interested contractors provide a capability statement. Interested parties may submit a capability statement, no more than one (1) page, for your company, your teammates and/or subcontractors and also denote the business size for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 511210.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		8540-00-NIB-0093<br />Name:		Tissue, Toilet, 1-Ply, White, 96 Rolls<br />Description:	1-ply toilet issue consists of 4" x 3.75" perforated sheets. White. UOI is BX. BX = 96 rolls and 1,000 sheets.</p>
<p>NSN:		8540-00-NIB-0094<br />Name:		Tissue, Toilet, 2-Ply, 4" x 3.75", White, 96 Rolls<br />Description:	2-ply toilet issue consists of 4" x 3.75" perforated sheets. White. UOI is BX. BX = 96 rolls and 1,000 sheets.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			8540-00-NIB-0093<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	WIN/WNS2200; WIN/WNS2240; SCA/TM1616; SCA/TM1616S; SCA/TM1619; SCA/TM6120S; SCA/TM6511S; BWK6150; BWK6180; BWK6155; BWK6145; BWK20GREEN; 410010/11634; 851166; WAU54900; WAU50000; WAU54000; APM280GREEN; APM250GREEN; APM235GREEN; APM275GREEN; APM276GREEN; APM248GREEN; GEN201; GEN238; GEN500; GEN502; NOR 880199; REN06104-WB; 422604/ 2033722/ 1150944; S-7131; 8540-01-380-0690/ NSN3800690</p>
<p>NSN:			8540-00-NIB-0094<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	10000; WAU14000; 5501; 1001; SCA/TS1636S; 851101; 11231; 11233; BWK6170; APM125GREEN; APM115GREEN; WNS/WIN2210; BWK40GREEN; GEN215; GEN218; MORMS1000</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 10, 2014 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) is planning to acquire engineering services for the Advanced Technology Support Program IV (ATSP4), which will be the next in a highly successful series of engineering services contracts. The purpose of this announcement is to provide notice for sources sought for an upcoming Source Selection for the ATSP4 requirement and to publicize the DMEA web site where additional information is available. ATSP4 is a uniform technical and management approach that leverages advanced technologies to meet the requirements of the Department of Defense (DoD) for a quick reaction capability across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support. This capability includes the development of appropriate solutions to keep a system operational, elevate sophistication level, or meet new threats. These efforts may include developing components to meet the DoD's requirements for ultra-low volumes, extending component availability, or ensuring a trusted, assured, and secure supply of microelectronics; also included will be the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements to DoD weapon systems in response to traditional and irregular (asymmetric) threats and to the problems related to aging weapon systems. Increasing warfighter capabilities and providing solutions to electronics support problems-such as, reliability, maintainability and obsolescence-are accomplished through the development and insertion of applications of advanced microelectronics technologies. The scope of ATSP4 covers both hardware and software and includes studies, analysis, design, software, simulation, prototyping, integration, testing, producibility, and limited production. The scope of ATSP4 also includes the development of viable methods and procedures for using available tools and resources, strategies for resolution of replacement alternatives, and technical interchange in support of task accomplishment. <br /><br />A Source Selection methodology will be utilized which anticipates multiple awards to large and small businesses for this indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type contract. Feedback received by DMEA will be used to help us shape the Request for Proposal (RFP). DMEA has established a web site located at: http://www.dmea.osd.mil/atsp4ss, where associated documentation has been posted. This site will utilize an interactive RFP approach where the solicitation will be refined through the analysis of industry comments and suggestions, which are encouraged. Posted information is non-binding and subject to change. In support of DoD paperless initiatives, all communications regarding this acquisition will be electronic.<br /><br />A virtual industry day is scheduled for this requirement. This will be via a teleconference or e-conference. Please visit the above website for more information. The website will be updated as more information becomes available.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (JOFOC) <P> (1) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a Justification for other than full and open competition. <P> This document is a justification for other than full and open competition prepared by NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC). <P> (2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. <P> This justification provides the rationale for contracting by other than full and open competition for the acquisition of natural gas distribution to DFRC.  <P> (3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs (including the estimated value). <P> DFRC purchases natural gas supplies from the Defense Logistics Agency - Energy Division (DLA). DLA transports these natural gas supplies to the eastern California border. This requirement is to have the gas supplies transported from the eastern California border to NASA DFRC. The estimated value for this action is $60,000. <P> (4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. <P> The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  <P> (5) A demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. <P> Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) has the only natural gas pipeline extending from the major distribution line adjacent to Highway 58 to DFRCs natural gas infrastructure. They have an existing GSA area-wide public utility contract and a separate task order will be issued for the required effort. <P> (6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. <P> Market research revealed there are no other sources that can provide this service. A notice was not publicized as required by Subpart 5.2, as the proposed contract action is for utility services and only one source is available. <P> (7) A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. <P> GSA purchases utility services in a manner that is consistent with the regulations, rulings, and franchise or service territories. Rates are established by independent regulatory bodies. These Tariff rates are considered prices set by law or regulation. <P> (8) A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. <P> A review of natural gas transportation infrastructure regional to DFRC reveals two major distribution lines running adjacent to California State Highway 58. These lines are operated by PG&E and the Mojave Pipeline Company.  <P> (9) There are no other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. <P> (10) No other sources expressed in writing an interest in the acquisition. <P> (11)  There are no actions, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required given the current infrastructure.  Research will be conducted prior to the award of future requirements, to ensure circumstances have not changed. <P> CONTRACTING OFFICER:		 I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <P>

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE:</p>
<p>A security pre-clearance must be performed for any employees referred to HIS through this contract.<br />Fingerprints must be completed and adjudicated prior to services being performed under this contract.<br />No contract award shall be made to any vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov throughout the duration of the contract. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the acquisition official if there is a change in provider.<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer. In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.<br />The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.<br />Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>As referenced in FAR, http://www.acquisition.gov/far/Reference <BR> <BR>(Full Text - Please see attachment A) <BR> <BR>UNENFORCEABILITY OF UNAUTHORIZED OBLIGATIONS (JUN 2013) (a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

(e) Agencies will review Contractor reported information for reasonableness and consistency with available contract information. In the event the agency believes that revisions to the Contractor reported information are warranted, the agency will notify the Contractor no later than November 15. By November 30, the Contractor shall revise the report, or document its rationale for the agency. 
(f)(1) The Contractor shall require each first-tier subcontractor providing services under this contract, with subcontract(s) each valued at or above the thresholds set forth in 4.1703(a)(2), to provide the following detailed information to the Contractor in sufficient time to submit the report:

The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within the period of performance.

<p style="mso-pagination: none">The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Alloy Software, Inc. 88 Park Avenue, Suite 2B, Nutley, JN 07110 for acquisition of Navigator Enterprise software, installation support, and training.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purchase order will include Alloy Navigator Enterprise version 6.5 software supporting 9 concurrent technician licenses and up to 999 audit licenses, two days of on-site installation consulting, three days of on-site training and one<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>year with two options of annual maintenance. This requirement is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. NSWC PCD has requirements for comprehensive operations and support of its local research network, as well as inventory tracking of the local NMCI network when that network segment transitions to the Next Generation network. Minimum network operations support requires the availability of Asset Management, Configuration Management, and Support/Help Desk software componentry to (1) audit and track hardware and software licenses on NSWC PCD systems; (2) attach non-network-discoverable equipment details and network management information to hardware and software records; and (3) provide a service/help desk capability for reporting, remediation, and tracking of network service exceptions. These components must integrate with one another to assure proper synchronization of current and historical data across the functional system capabilities. The three categories of software are represented in the Department of the Navy Application and Database Management System (DADMS) by the Enterprise Information Environment Mission Area (EIEMA) taxonomic categories 01.01.04, 01.02.04.01.03, and 01.01.02.03, respectively. As of 13 Jan 2014, the only product listed within these three taxonomies and approved for use by the Navy is Alloy Navigator v6.5, DADMS ID 85340. Therefore, acquisition of Alloy Navigator Enterprise v6.5 is the only Navy-approved way forward available to NSWC PCD given its network support requirements. The Alloy Navigator software is proprietary to Alloy Software Inc. and is only available from Alloy Software. The NAICS code is 511210. The Small Business size standard is $35.5M. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City (NSA PC), Receiving Officer Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001. Delivery terms for this requirement are FOB Destination.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave SE<br />Washington, D.

12. Description:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-14-Q-200069 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-72.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411.  The small business size standard is 1,500 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopter Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items.  Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.    

SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET HSCG38-14-Q-200069 - REQUIREMENTS FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS.

Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew.  Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM.  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  

The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. Certificate of Conformance must be submitted in the format specified in the clause.  All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.

NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED.  ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED. 

The Government reserves the right to withhold any item or group of items contained in this solicitation upon award.  The Government reserves the right to make a single award, no award, or multiple awards if after considering the additional administrative costs it is in the Governments best interest to do so.  The Government shall assume, for the purpose of making multiple awards, that $500 would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administering each contract awarded under this solicitation.  Individual awards shall be for the items or combinations of items that result in the lowest cost to the Government including the assumed administrative costs.  

NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.

SEE ATTACHED DOCUMENT TITLED TERMS AND CONDITIONS  HSCG38-14-Q-200069 FOR APPLICABLE CLAUSES, INSTRUCTIONS AND EVALUTION CRITERIA.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>FAR 52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that - <br />(i) The offeror and/or any of its Principals - <br />(A) Are 0 are not 0 presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or delclared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency</p>
<p>(B) Have 0 have not 0, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are 0 are not 0 presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have 0 have not 0, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has 0 has not 0, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

The Government may issue orders requiring delivery to multiple destinations or performance at multiple locations.<br />(c) Except as this contract otherwise provides, the Government shall order from the Contractor all the supplies or services specified in the Schedule that are required to be purchased by the Government activity or activities specified in the Schedule.<br />(d) The Government is not required to purchase from the Contractor requirements in excess of any limit on total orders under this contract.</p>
<p>(e) If the Government urgently requires delivery of any quantity of an item before the earliest date that delivery may be specified under this contract, and if the Contractor will not accept an order providing for the accelerated delivery, the Government may acquire the urgently required goods or services from another source.</p>
<p>(f) Any order issued during the effective period of this contract and not completed within that period shall be completed by the Contractor within the time specified in the order. The contract shall govern the Contractor's and Government's rights and obligations with respect to that order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the contract's effective period; provided, that the Contractor shall not be required to make any deliveries under this contract after completion of the last delivery order that is issued before the expiration of this Contract. <br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>

<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

The Contracting Officer will make an integrated assessment based on the evaluation factors described above.</p>

The HQAMC Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or another external forum.  The proper address for AMC level protests is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil <BR> <BR>The Contracting Officer (KO) at Mission and Installation contracting Office, Joint Base Lewis-McChord is the only person authorized to approve changes or modify any of the requirements under this contract, and notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely with the KO.  In the event the Contractor or contract employee effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the KO, the change will be considered to have been without authority, and no adjustment will be made in the contract price under the Changes clause or any other clause to cover any increase in costs incurred as a result thereof. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>Please note the following two questions have been answered:
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Q1.</span></strong> In the Definitional Mission report excerpts included in RFP Annex 2, there is text missing from the seventh page, fourth paragraph on Data Standards. Please provide the missing text.</p>
<p>A1. The corrected text is as follows:<br />Data Standards: Usually, data sources do not communicate via common standards. However, the two dominant standards existing today are the common information model (CIM) and Multi Speak. Both define a standard data interface that supports batch and real-time data exchange. Multi Speak originated with the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and CIM is an open-source standard through the IEC.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Q2.</span></strong> The RFP does not appear to provide the planned start date for this technical assistance project. Please provide the planned start date.</p>
<p>A2. The start date will be determined by CPRI and the selected contractor. As noted in the Mandatory Contract Clauses, CPRI and the selected contractor will negotiate a draft contract and submit that contract to USTDA's Office of General Counsel for review and approval; disbursement of grant funds will be made only after USTDA approval of the contract between CPRI and the selected Contractor.</p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>The AFNWC/PZIC will be soliciting a 100% Total Small Business Set-Aside, Firm Fixed Price Contract to support the 377 MSG/CE mission at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. Competition will be restricted to companies with a bona fide place of business in the State of New Mexico.</p>
<p>The Government's obligation under this Pre-Solicitation and follow on Request for Proposals (RFP) is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds. No legal liability on the part of the Government for payment of any money shall arise unless, and until, funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this procurement and award has been made by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Work under this project is comprised of designing and constructing a repair to the roof of Building 1025 at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The existing pitched, metal roof has exceeded its useful life. The primary goal of this project is to furnish and install a new, Standing Seam Roof (SSR) system over the existing system, anchoring it to the existing steel structure below. Estimated Period of Performance (POP) for requirement is 169 days. IAW FAR 36.204(d) the estimated price range for this requirement is between $250,000 and $500,000.</p>
<p>A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) evaluations described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.1 targeted toward a 100% Total Small Business set-a-side with a 30-day response time (offers due 30 days after issuing).</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled. Kirtland AFB plans to include the following factors:</p>
<p>1) Cost/Price<br />2) Technical Acceptability<br />3) Past Performance</p>
<p>Within the Past Performance Factor the following sub-factor will be used:</p>
<p>a) Filled out Past Performance Information Forms</p>
<p>Within the Technical Acceptability Factor the following sub-factors will be used:</p>
<p>a) Technical Approach Narrative<br />b) Proposed Progress Schedule</p>
<p>The Cost/Price factor will be afforded primary emphasis in the evaluation. All other evaluation factors other than Cost/Price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost/price.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 11 March&nbsp;2014 and close on or about 30 calendar days thereafter. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation. Prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database before award of a government contract; failure to register in the SAM database may cause your firm to be ineligible for award.</p>

<DESC><p>Questions and Answers from Vendors:<br /><br />questions regarding Sources Sought Synopsis with Draft T53PWS paragraph 1.4.5 "Foreign Disclosure Restrictions do not apply to this effort" are as stated below:</p>
<p><br />Question: We assume this means there is no restriction on dissemination of technical information to foreign persons or entities. Is this correct? We ask this question because we are a foreign owned US company and, if awarded such work, may involve foreign nationals.</p>
<p>Program Office Response: No, this assumption is not correct. Any interested vendor for the T53-L-703 repair effort must be a Honeywell, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) authorized / certified repair facility and abide by the export / license agreements pertaining to the use of Honeywell commercial T53 technical manuals as outlined per Honeywell agreement with certified company. This agreement would pertain to the company and any of their sub-vendor or foreign owned repair sites intending to use the Honeywell T53 commercial technical manuals under the agreement. Release of technical manuals to other-than-certified / authorized OEM vendors is not prohibited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: Would it be permissible to perform some of this work outside of the US? In such case we might ship parts or assemblies for repair to another location.</p>
<p>Program Office Response: Yes, it is possible to perform the T53 workload effort outside of the US as long as the company and its repair sites are Honeywell certified. The Program Office is considering for evaluation of proposals purposes only, evaluating the transportation cost as part of the bid proposal costs to account for the extra shipping/transportation charges, and risks with overseas shipments of engine assets.</p>

<SUBJECT>RFI: DMSP C2 Into NOAA and/or NSA Ground Systems
<SOLNBR>WM012014
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<RESPDATE>032414
<CONTACT>Felicia N. Brown, Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 653-3515, Email felicia.brown@losangeles.af.mil - John Tanaiweski, Technical , Phone (719) 556-2495, Email John.Tanaiweski.1@us.af.mil
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to determine the feasibility and associated cost estimates for incorporating the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) command and control (C2) capability within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and/or National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite ground system architectures located at the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland (NSOF), MD and applicable backup facilities, as appropriate. The Government is interested in identifying innovative Ideas from industry that enable continued ground system support of the operational mission through End-of Life (EOL) (mid 2020's) while simultaneously reducing the cost to operate and maintain the C2 capability.</p>
<p>The Government expects to receive comments and suggestions which will assist in improving draft acquisition documents needed to affect this change. Specifically, suggestions that may improve pre-award planning, timelines, as well as any additional pertinent information industry deems necessary to improve the quality of the entire Request For Proposal (RFP) package.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>DMSP provides an enduring and survivable capability to collect and disseminate global visible and infrared cloud data to support worldwide Department of Defense (DoD) operations and high priority programs.</p>
<p>The DMSP mission was to be subsumed by the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). The NPOESS program, suffering delays and cost-overruns due to issues with sensor developments, was dissolved effective 29 Sep 2010. Ownership of the DMSP Command, Control, and Communications (C3) Ground System (GS), known as DC3GS, was transferred from NPOESS Integrated Program Office (IPO) to the United States Air Force, Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) in June 2010. SMC/WML (Colorado Springs) is the DC3GS Program Management Office (PMO). NOAA continues to operate the system on behalf of the Air Force.</p>
<p>The GS is an earth based command, telemetry and data processing system providing all functions for the state-of-health maintenance, communications, sensor payload data retrieval and dissemination, and launch and early orbit support for the DMSP constellation. The DMSP operation centers that command and control the DMSP constellation have not been technically refreshed in over twenty years. Major components of the system were reused from legacy control centers and in some cases are beyond their end of life expectancy. The ground system is operating under an Authority-to-Operate which is at risk due to system equipment being incapable of supporting current security postures.</p>
<p>Primary DMSP C2 satellite operations is conducted at NSOF's Space Operation Center, Suitland, MD and backup at the Environmental Satellite Operations Center (ESOC), operated by the, 6th Space Operations Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base (AFB) CO. Five crews each of five personnel support satellite operations. Satellite contact is made through the Fairbanks Satellite Operations Facility, Fairbanks, AK; Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) ground stations worldwide; and McMurdo GS, Antarctic. Command and/or data recovery at the higher latitude, polar locations are particularly advantageous due to access nearly every orbit. Principle DMSP users are the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), Omaha, NE; and the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC), at Monterey, CA.</p>
<p><br />Statement of Need</p>
<p>The purpose of this effort is to sustain the DMSP C3 capability through the projected EOL. Particular interest is to reduce long term operations and maintenance costs through leveraging existing NOAA or NASA infrastructure; increasing automation; use of commercial satellite ground link antennas or services; and minimalizing use of AFSCN.</p>
<p>Trade space:<br />&bull; Use of AFSCN / NOAA / NASA / commercial antenna assets should be considered for commanding, up/downlinks, and data distribution<br />o Via cost effective and industry standard best practices<br />&bull; Use of automation to minimize operations costs<br />&bull; Change of operations concepts to reduce crew size <br />&bull; Investments, if any, needed to enable operational migration<br />&bull; Other relevant options the industry partner thinks is appropriate</p>
<p>Constraints:<br />&bull; Central user (AFWA / FNMOC) interfaces must be maIntained<br />&bull; Interfaces for space segment assets/equipment located at the NSOF must be maintained<br />o Primary Display System (Northrup Grumman)<br />o Advanced Flight Vehicle Simulation Facility (AFVSF) (Lockheed Martin)<br />&bull; Interfaces for the McMurdo Data Transfer Station (JPSS) must be maintained<br />&bull; DMSP SORD Reliability, Availability, Maintainability metric requirements must be met<br />&bull; Central user data delivery rate and latency requirements must be met</p>
<p>The following services are expected to be included in the RFI response:<br />&bull; Activities necessary to sustain the GS's ability to command and control DMSP assets<br />&bull; Components, if any, needed to be procured to enable an operational migration onto NOAA/NASA ground systems and their cost estimates.<br />&bull; Commercial services, if any, needed to be procured and their cost estimates<br />&bull; Activities necessary to receive, process, analyze, and disseminate telemetry and mission data to central users<br />&bull; Activities necessary to identify and resolve ground, space, and user segment anomalies / deficiencies<br />&bull; Activities necessary to obtain / maintain compliance with applicable US Government Information Assurance issuances or requirements<br />&bull; Life cycle costs estimates, to included projected O&amp;M savings, and methodology used</p>
<p>Access to Important Documents</p>
<p>All documents related to DMSP are considered to be sensitive but unclassified; therefore the Government has created a library which will contain all applicable procurement documents. Below are instructions on how to access the site:</p>
<p>Vendors need to fill out a nondisclosure form (please see attachment) and attach it in an email to Felicia.brown@us.af.mil requesting access to the site.</p>
<p>Due to International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) requirements, only US citizens will be granted access IAW the Arms Export Control Act. In addition, documents shall only be released IAW DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5230.24.</p>
<p>The email should contain the following information:<br />&bull;Name of user<br />&bull;Company/Organization<br />&bull;Email Address<br />&bull;Phone</p>
<p>SMC/WM will send you an email with log in information. After you receive this notification, please send Ms. Brown an email confirming your account has been set up.</p>
<p>Please note, all documents related to this procurement will be posted on this workspace site, therefore, it is the vendor's responsibility to ensure they have access at all times.</p>

<DESC>The Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), and the Brigade Modernization Command (BMC) intend to conduct an Instrumented Department of Army (DA) Directed Evaluation on available Soldier Radio Waveform - Appliques (SRW-A) during Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) 14-2.  The objective of this evaluation is to obtain sufficient data to determine if SRW-A can satisfy the vehicular mounted, near-term networking capability with a Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) waveform as identified in the Rifleman Radio Capability Production Document (CPD) and the JTRS Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit (HMS) CPD.  Satisfactory demonstration of this capability will support the requisite Material Release(s) for product fielding and may lead to an SRW-A fielding solution for Capability Set 15 (CS-15) and other DOD and Government requirements.       <br>      <br>   The strategic goals for this operational evaluation are to document the performance baseline of the various SRW-A radios with regard to:    <br>      <br>       i.	Network management   <br>      ii.	Interoperability considerations   <br>     iii.	Equipment capabilities to include ease of use   <br>      <br>   Prior to participating in NIE 14-2 the SRW-A must:    <br>      <br>   1)  Have a minimum of one SRW capable channel.    <br>      <br>   2)  Have the ability to be endorsed by the National Security Agency (NSA) to protect user voice and data to the SECRET level in time to participate in NIE 14.2.    <br>      <br>   3)  Have the ability to obtain a Safety Release in time to participate in NIE 14.2.    <br>      <br>   4)  Have the ability to obtain Spectrum Certification (DD Form 1494) in time to participate in NIE 14.2.   <br>      <br>   5)  Have the ability to obtain Interim Authority to Test (IATT) in time to participate in NIE 14.2.    <br>      <br>   6)  Have the ability to provide as Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) approximately 25 each SRW-A to NIE 14.2 by 7 FEB 2014.  Five of these SRW-A are to be provided to the LBRR as soon as possible, and five of the SRW-A installation kits are to be provided for installation build by 10 JAN 2014.     <br>      <br>   7)  Have the ability to complete the PM provided NIE Request for Information (RFI) package by 15 JAN 2014 (package will be provided by PM upon request).   <br>      <br>   8)  Have the ability to provide Field Service Support during NIE 14.2 preparation (to include LBRR, instrumentation development, Golden Vehicle Build, data products build, etc.) without the expectation of reimbursement by the Government.  As a minimum, a dedicated on-site Field Service Representative (FSR) would be expected during the NIE event from 15 FEB 2014 through 31 MAY 2014, as well as to provide engineering support for the CFE during all field preparation.       <br>      <br>   NIE 14-2 is a time driven event and will occur regardless of the SRW-A test readiness.  The Government will make every attempt to conduct the Instrumented DA Directed Evaluation on all SRW-A variants which meet the eight NIE prerequisites listed above.  However, Test Readiness Reviews (TRR) will be conducted on each SRW-A.  Each SRW-A will gain entrance or be denied entrance into the SRW-A Directed Evaluation based on that product lines' TRR.    <br>      <br>   All costs for both outbound and return shipment of the CFE will be at the participant's expense.  Arrangements for return shipment of the CFE will be made as soon as possible after completion of the NIE 14-2.   <br>      <br>   PM TR NIE POC for this action is Ms. Flora Marshall, flora.m.marshal.civ@mail.mil, (443) 395-1124.    <br>      <br>   THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This announcement is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute an RFP or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued. If an RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.   <br>      <br>   Only UNCLASSIFIED information shall be included in any response.   <br>        <br>   Proprietary or business sensitive information provided in response to this announcement shall be marked appropriately, and it will not be disclosed outside the Government or its support contractors.   <br>      <br>   Companies interested in having their SRW-A evaluated during NIE 14-2 must notify the undersigned of their interest within two weeks of this notice.  <br>    <br>  CHANGE 1 - 23 DEC 2013 - The e-mail address for Ms. Marshall is corrected to: flora.m.marshall.civ@mail.mil.    <br>    <br>  All other content of the announcement is unchanged.  Due to the e-mail error in the original posting, industry respondents are requested to re-submit any previous messages intended for Ms. Marshall to ensure their receipt. <br>  <br> CHANGE 2 - 24 FEB 2014 <br>  <br> The Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) has recently determined that it will be unable to support a Department of the Army (DA) Directed Evaluation during NIE 14.2 on the available Soldier Radio Waveform - Appliqu s (SRW-A).  The DA is now working toward an SRW-A Operational Test during NIE 15.1.    <br>  <br> In anticipation of the Operation Test, vendors with SRW-A currently integrated into vehicles for NIE 14.2 are encouraged to continue to participate as a risk reduction exercise, which will include an evaluation by the Brigade Modernization Command (BMC). <br>  <br> Vendors who do not wish to support the NIE 14.2 exercise at their own expense, may request that all of their Contractor Furnished Equipment (CFE) SRW-A equipment be returned to them.  Such requests should be made by e-mail message to the Contracting Officer within one week of the posting of this change notice. <br>  <br> Arrangements for the return shipment of the CFE will be made as soon as possible for those vendors that do not wish to continue participation in the NIE 14.2 exercise.   <br>  <br> Other vendors who wish to continue their participation as a risk reduction exercise will have arrangements made for the return shipment of the CFE after the NIE 14.2 exercise has been completed. <br>  <br> Additional information regarding evaluation of SRW-A for the NIE 15.1 exercise will be made by separate notice via www.fbo.gov as those requirements are established. <br>  <br> Any questions or comments concerning this notice may also be submitted by e-mail message to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>NAICS Codes: 339112 and 423450
<p>Title: Request for Information - Mechanical Ventilators</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>This is a request for information. It is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to:<br />(1) Obtain product listings of full-featured critical care and transportable, portable or home care mechanical ventilators and their associated ancillary supplies. <br />(2) Obtain information on the manufacturing capability and capacity to provide mechanical ventilators. <br />(3) Make use of this information to inform acquisition strategies that may be used to support preparedness and response to public health emergencies requiring the use of mechanical ventilators.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Within the Federal government, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is tasked with protecting the civilian population by providing leadership in research, development, acquisition, deployment, and use of effective medical countermeasures to treat the adverse health effects resulting from intentional exposure to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat agents, pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases.</p>
<p>The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic exemplified the unpredictability and rapidity with which a novel influenza strain can impact the world's population. With a historic effort from both Government and industry partners, vaccines were developed and available to the public six months after the initial outbreak. Despite high infection rates, the 2009 H1N1 virus was only mildly pathogenic, with relatively low rates of accompanying morbidity and mortality in the general population. However, it is possible that future pandemics will feature morbidity and mortality rates comparable with more severe pandemics such as 1957. The ever-present and ever-evolving threat of pandemic influenza presents a compelling need for the federal government to optimize preparedness using medical countermeasures currently available in the marketplace and to develop innovation in the prevention and treatment of influenza disease.</p>
<p>Mechanical ventilators are a critical life-saving non-pharmaceutical medical countermeasure for patients experiencing respiratory failure that could result from the consequences of a pandemic influenza, emerging infectious disease or other chemical, biological or radiological event. These events can quickly overwhelm the hospital resources of the locale and the region. In a public health emergency resulting in respiratory failure for a large number of patients, hospitals will need to surge the medical capabilities needed to provide mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p>Requirement:<br />The Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are seeking information from the manufacturing community on mechanical ventilator products and manufacturing capabilities that serve all members of the U.S. population, including the general adult population, children, elderly individuals, pregnant women, diabetic individuals, individuals with mental and physical disabilities, the immune-compromised, hyper-allergenic individuals and those with pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
<p>Submission Instructions:</p>
<p>Respondents (manufacturers) are asked to provide only the most pertinent information, data, and materials necessary to adequately convey a declaration of capability in line with this notice.</p>
<p>Respondents (manufacturers) are asked to provide a cover page that contains the following information:<br />(1) All Point of Contact information (email addresses, phone numbers, and mailing address)<br />(2) DUNS number<br />(3) All relevant NAICS Codes<br />(4) Identification as a large or small business. If small, indicate the classification.<br />(5) Identification of services on any Federal Supply Schedules, if any, and the relevant schedule numbers.</p>
<p>Respondents (Manufacturers) are asked to provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Product literature and specifications sheets for mechanical ventilator products (attach as an electronic pdf or Microsoft Word documents). These include critical care and transportable, portable, or home care mechanical ventilators for:<br />a) Products that are commercially available, licensed by the FDA or other regulatory authority, and used for mechanical ventilation in the US and/or abroad; and<br />b) Products in advanced development with data that may support their deployment in an emergency mass-casualty incident.<br />2. General Information on the Company's line of products and market capabilities (attach as an electronic pdf or Microsoft Word document)<br />3. Information on manufacturing capabilities, capacities and market information that address the following questions (Use accompanying Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet):<br />a) The location of manufacture for each ventilator model (country, city, State).<br />b) Length of time (years) each model has been in production.<br />c) Length of time (years) each model will be supported by the servicing department.<br />d) The maintenance schedule and estimated average annual life cycle costs for each model.<br />e) Estimated number of ventilator units currently in use in the United States.<br />f) Estimated number of ventilator units sold for disaster preparedness for each model (units per State).<br />g) The current average monthly manufacturing production over the past year (units per month).<br />h) The maximum monthly manufacturing surge that can be achieved and sustained over a 12-week period.<br />i) The ramp up time needed (days) to meet maximum production.<br />j) The time (in days) required to deliver 1000 ventilator units, 2500 units, 5000 units (non-surge).<br />k) Countries where raw materials, components, subassemblies, etc. are sourced from.<br />l) List of required accessories for each model (adult/child circuits, inlet filters, bacterial filters, heat/moisture exchangers, closed circuit suction catheters, PEEP valves and other related items).</p>
<p>Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. To aid HHS, please segregate and clearly mark proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become the property of the Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>This REQUEST FOR INFORMATION is in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997), as such, any information received will be for the purpose of planning only.</p>
<p>Responses to this REQUEST FOR INFORMATION notice, along with a firm's capability statement referencing "Request for Information - Mechanical Ventilators" may be submitted electronically via email to the three points of contact listed below NO LATER THAN 5PM EST, March 18, 2014).</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

   (2) For the new items with the exchange (trade-in allowance) for the exchange property listed.
(b) The contracting officer is not obligated to award on an exchange basis. If the lowest evaluated offer is an offer for the new items without any exchange, the contracting officer may award on that basis and forgo the exchange.
(c) Exchanges may be made only with the successful offeror. When the successful offer includes an exchange, award one contract for both the acquisition of the new property and the trade-in of the exchange property. The only exception is when the items must be acquired against a mandatory Federal supply schedule contract, in which case, award a separate contract for the exchange. <BR> <BR>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC><p>This amendment is issued to extend the submission due date from 5:00 PM (EST) on 3 March 2014 to 5:00 PM (EST) on 6 March 2014 and to provide answers to questions received.</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>Would the Government consider adding, or allowing industry to add as an addendum, a section for comments and recommendations regarding the draft SOW and acquisition strategy, in order to provide the Government the full benefit of the industry's experience with Planning?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to submit as an addendum, which will not count towards the total page count,comments and recommendations regarding the SOW and/or acquistion strategy.</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>The Industry Day announcements were released as two separate announcements under NAIC codes 336611 and 54133, but the sources sought indicates that only NAICS Code 541330 is being considered for small business set aside. There are companies that are large business in 541330, but are small business in 336611 for Ship Building and Repair that have very robust planning experience and capabilities. Would the Government consider amending the sources sought to see which of these NAIC codes would actually offer the most advantage to the Government?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>No. The appropriate NAIC codes for the Advanced Planning effort is covered under NAIC code 54133 and not 336611.</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>Would the Government consider extending the due date for the sources sought response by one week to allow industry to provide the best possible responses to optimize the information the Government receives?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The submission date has been extended to 5:00 PM (EST) on 6 March 2014.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to announce that Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) - Fort Bliss, TX intends to issue a sole source seven-month extension to AC First for logistical support services in supply, maintenance and transportation for the Logistics Readiness Center (LRC).    The extension is a result of delays in the Army Contracting Command's (ACC) ability to award the next contract under the Enhanced Army Global Logistics Enterprise (EAGLE) Basic Ordering Agreement.  Due to the magnitude and complexity of the requirement, AC First, is the only company that can immediately perform the logistical support services with the necessary management and labor structure in place and posses the skill sets, capabilities, and expertise that will ensure continuity of services thereby eliminating a break in service or the revamping of equipment logs.  Award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling this requirement and would negatively impact the LRC's mission.  All work to be performed under this extension has been determined to be in scope and in accordance with the original contract Statement of Work.  This requirement has and continues to be performed by AC First.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is it to be construed as market research; however, it is issued to mitigate unacceptable delays to agency's requirement.  No solicitation package will be issued or accepted.

<DESC>As a follow on to the Sudan Propety Rights Program (SPRP) that ended in October 2010, and in anticipation that the draft Land Policy would be approved, USAID designed and awarded the Sudan Rural Land Governance (SRLG) project in February 2011. The purpose of the SRLG project was to help define and implement laws and regulations related to land tenure and property rights, and institutions that guide the administration and management of land tenure and property rights. The SRLG project has been supporting the development of a sound land tenure system by: (i) providing technical assistance to the Southern Sudan Land Commission to refine the Land Act 2009 and coordinate it with other related legislation supporting land tenure and property rights (which cannot occur until the Land Policy is passed by the parliament), (ii) supporting the state- level by providing technical assistance in two pilot States (Western Equatoria and Jonglei) to define state-level rules governing land use planning, land administration and adjudication, (iii) piloting establishment of one pilot County Land Authority within each of these two States, and (iv) building capacity of State- and County-level land authorities through site specific actions to secure land tenure and  improve land use planning in each of the two counties.<br /> <br />AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5) stipulates that competition need not be obtained for an "award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the government or would result in unacceptable delays."<br /><br />As the current SRLG activity is due to expire in February 2014, a one year activity is required to prevent an interruption in critical land tenure reform activities until procurement of the long term activity can be completed in late 2014 and an evaluation can be completed assessing the effectiveness of the exisitng activity in 2014 whicch will inform on the new long term activity. &nbsp;<br /><br />Based on the current experiences and the field work so far accomplished by Tetra Tech ARD in providing technical advice on the Land Policy and conducting the land use planning in Jonglei and land inventory in Yambio, and the time that will take to carryout a full and open competition for a one year award, the Mission proposes to extend the Tetra Tech ARD contract for a further one year and increase funding by approximately $1.5 million. &nbsp;<br /><br />If a new contract is awarded instead of the requested extension, the new implementer would require substantial additional costs for mobilization, start up, assessment and/or feasibility study, the requirement of building new relationships/partners across South Sudan, recruitment of new, untrained staff,  office and accommodation acquisition.  These costs would be duplicated by demobilization of the current contractor.
<p>Issuing a one year cost extension to Tetra Tech ARD, which has the local experienced staff and is willing to complete the land tenure activities to prevent an interruption to land tenure reform will allow the Mission to save significant resources and avoid unacceptable delays, while maintaining the current momentum in the project. The fact that trained local staff will be relied upon in lieu of international experts for the one year extension is laudable.  If a new contractor would be procured just to complete these finishing activities, the new implementer would likely rely on international experts, since the local staff cultivated by SRLG familiar with the activities would likely have transitioned to other projects.</p>
