<DESC><p>Request for Information<br />FA8056-16-R-0001<br />Air Force Installation Contracting Agency<br />771st Enterprise Sourcing Squadron<br />Facility Demolition Services</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain market information or capabilities for planning purposes as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Participants are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds. It does not guarantee a subsequent solicitation will be issued. Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and costs associated with any submission will not be reimbursed by the Government. The information requested will be used by the Air Force to facilitate decision making for potential future acquisitions. Please monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) website for future information pertaining to this potential requirement.</p>
<p>1.0 Background</p>
<p>The 771 ESS/EGA is seeking additional information on Facility Demolition Services (FDS) in support of Air Force installations throughout the Continental United States (CONUS).</p>
<p>The 771 ESS/EGA is part of the Air Force Installation Contracting Agency (AFICA). The mission of AFICA is to provide the U.S. Air Force cross-functional installation sourcing and acquisition solutions. AFICA is the Air Force's centralized organization for executing enterprise-wide sourcing of goods and services for CONUS Air Force installations. AFICA utilizes strategic sourcing best practices to continually improve and re-evaluate organizational purchasing activities improving quality and reducing costs for installation acquisition. The 771st uses cross-functional teams to strategically source goods and/or services at the enterprise level.</p>
<p>We are continuing our market research into FDS to better understand the capabilities of the industry. The initial scope of this research includes the following services for facility demolition at Air Force installations:</p>
<p>- Site surveys / Architectural &amp; Engineering Services<br />- Stand-alone demolition of buildings and associated infrastructure<br />- Waste management<br />-- Waste disposal<br />-- Recycling<br />-- Abatement (i.e. asbestos, lead-based paint, PCB, etc.)<br />- Returning sites to usable conditions (excavation, backfilling, grading, sodding, etc.)</p>
<p>Currently, these services are typically procured by each facility using a local base contracting office. The 771st is researching a long term strategic sourcing solution to satisfy future USAF requirements for FDS. Early market intelligence indicates that there is potential for $50M in spend over a five year period for FDS on CONUS USAF installations.</p>
<p>2.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>The 771st seeks information from industry on the unique aspects or procedures for FDS throughout CONUS. We seek both large and small business respondents who are interested in supporting the Air Force's needs. The input received will help us ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity of all potential offerors. Reviews of available North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes/spend suggests the following NAICS codes may be applicable for this RFI: 238910 Site Preparation Contractors, 238990 All Other Specialty Trade Contractors.</p>
<p>3.0&nbsp; Facility Demolition Survey<br /><br />A copy of the Facility Demolition&nbsp;survey has been uploaded with this RFI posting for industry review prior to availability.&nbsp; The actual survey will be made available for completion by close of business Monday, 19 October 2015.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you are an interested large or small business, please complete the questionnaire that will be posted Monday, 19 October 2015.&nbsp; This will include providing the name, phone number, and e-mail address of a company representative that the Government may contact for additional information. We highly encourage all interested parties to provide a complete and thorough questionnaire in response to this RFI. However, not responding will not preclude participation should a solicitation be released. A draft statement of work is not yet available for release; however, we anticipate this will be available in the near future for industry comment.</p>
<p>When available, the link will direct you to the online questionnaire. You will need to have information such as your company's DUNs number, basic employee data, revenue data, etc. for the past 3 years (or as best approximated). The .pdf document is for reference only. The Government will not be accepting written responses. The online questionnaire is the preferred source tool for gathering responses; please use the best available information or estimates. If you need to stop the survey during any time, you will be able to resume your session using the same computer from which you started.</p>
<p>Information gained through this RFI will be used to further define the Air Force requirements. Individual capability briefs and or statements will not be accepted at this time. Interested parties are urged to monitor the official Government point of entry at the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website www.fbo.gov for announcements regarding future needs. It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this site regularly for any changes or updates. The FBO website can send automatic alerts when a notice is posted meeting established criteria. More information on how to subscribe to this service is available on the "Getting Started" page at https://www.fbo.gov/?s=getstart&amp;mode=list&amp;tab=list. Search agents can be established for any combination of criteria, be set to run at your desired frequency and will notify you of relevant opportunities. This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification. Subscribers to this service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the FBO site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions.</p>
<p>4.0 Industry Discussions</p>
<p>The 771st representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such discussions would only be intended to obtain further clarification of potential capability to meet future USAF FDS requirements.</p>
<p>5.0 Responses/Questions</p>
<p>Please complete the questionnaire no later than 5:00PM, 26 October 2015. Please direct any questions or comments on this RFI to the FDS inbox, AFICA.AF.FacilityDemolition@us.af.mil. You may also direct responses to these POCs via email through 5:00PM, 26 October 2015.</p>

<DESC>DLA Energy, in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the Natural Gas (NAICS 221210) utility system at U.S. Army Garrison Pine Bluff Arsenal, Arkansas.
<p>Utilities Privatization (UP) is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity, for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility systems replacements. The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. UP will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. &sect;2688 - Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.</p>
<p>As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the Natural Gas utility system. The new owner shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, maintenance costs, major system renovations, construction, equipment, manpower, and overhead costs shall become the utility system owner's responsibility. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain, and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.</p>
<p>Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right to Access or an Easement as a reference to the resultant contract. The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. Past performance information from potential offerors shall be submitted as directed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>A Sources Sought Notice for this requirement was previously publicized under solicitation number SPE600-16-R-0802 on July 10, 2015. The Sources Sought Notice has closed and market research is complete. This requirement will be unrestricted. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit an offer.</p>
<p>Other-than-small businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer. Interested sources may contact Denise Maloney at Denise.Maloney@dla.mil, Yazmin Mendoza at Yazmin.Mendoza@dla.mil, or Anna Muldowney at Anna.Muldowney @dla.mil to be added to our offeror mailing list.</p>
<p>A copy of the solicitation will be available on or after November 30, 2015, via the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) system (https://www.fbo.gov).</p>
<p>Secure Documents</p>
<p>As this requirement will be an unrestricted, competitive action, several of the solicitation documents will be posted as "secured" on the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") website. In order to view those documents, vendors will need to obtain special access. The process of obtaining access is somewhat lengthy, therefore all interested vendors are encouraged to begin that process as soon as possible. Instructions for obtaining access are provided below.</p>
<p>Instructions for access to the FBO Secure Site</p>
<p>To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the FBO system, vendors must follow these instructions:</p>
<p>1. Register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. For assistance with SAM, please contact the SAM help desk. Contact information is available at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p>2. Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at https://www.fbo.gov/ and log in. Verify your SAM registration within the FBO system. For assistance with FBO, please consult the FBO Vendor Guide, which is available at https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf.</p>
<p>3. After your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, please follow the steps as outlined below:</p>
<p>a) Begin by clicking on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement. The DD2345 is also available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf. <br />b) Fill out the DD 2345 and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form.<br />c) JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date. Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect.<br />d) For assistance with the DD2345, or to inquire about the acceptability of electronic provision of documentation, please contact the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS. Contact information is available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/team.aspx. DLA Energy is not involved in the approval process and cannot provide assistance with processing.<br />e) Once approval is received, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.</p>
<p>4. Once you receive the approved DD2345 from JCP, and have verified your status on the JCP website, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link. The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN. If you are not prompted to enter a MPIN, please contact the FBO help desk. Contact information can be found at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p>a) The MPIN is a mandatory data element created by the SAM registrant which must have nine characters [consisting of at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number, with no spaces or special characters permitted]<br />b) The MPIN allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also validates access to sensitive, but unclassified, documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p>5. Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors must then submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button. Upon requesting explicit access in the FBO system, vendors should send an email notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, so that they can approve the request in the FBO system. Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p>Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is conducting a Markey Survey for Convair 580 Ground Training.  The FAA intends to review all responses to this market survey to establish the acquisition strategy.  

The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting proposals at this time.

Background and Scope of Work:

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC), has a requirement for Convair 580 ground training to support FAA airborne Research and Development. The contractor must provide the ground school training for the Convair 580, which will include a comprehensive aircraft system review, and emergency procedures review in our Convair aircraft. 

The FAA CV580 aircraft have been extensively modified from the originally certified CV580 configuration. These modifications, in particular, include extensive improvements to the aircraft electrical and avionics systems. Both of the FAAs CV580 aircraft are configured with split buss electrical systems and avionics configurations, which make each aircraft capable of being certified for Category II operations.

The integrated avionics systems include a 5 tube Electronic Flight Information System (EFIS), dual independent Flight Management Systems (FMS), Global Positioning System (GPS) and inertial navigation integrated with the FMSs, Traffic Alert and Collision System (TCAS), Automatic Dependence Surveillance (ADS-B) equipment, dual digital communications and navigation radio management systems, dual digital Air Data Computer (ADC) systems, and extensive independent backup communications and navigation systems. 

Additional significant modifications include complete modern redesign of the aircraft engine instrumentation and support systems instrumentation and control functions.

Course Requirements:

1.)  At a minimum, ground instruction will cover the following aircraft systems: 
  Electrical System
  Allision 501 Engine
  Aero-Products 606A Prop
  Ice & Rain Protection
  Hydraulic System

2.)  The ground class duration will be no longer than 4 days. The first 2 days will be aircraft system review in the classroom. The aircraft system review will be 16 hrs (8 hours on Monday and 8 hours on Tuesday). The remaining 2 days will be used to review Abnormal and Emergency Procedures. During this portion of instruction, each crew will receive 2 hours in the actual aircraft (static only). 

3.)  The ground instructor will provide training up to 10 Pilots slots from the FAA Research & development Flight Program.

4.)  The ground instructor will be required to travel to the William J. Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ and bring all training material necessary to conduct the course. The WJHTC will have a conference room reserved for the training.

Instructor Requirements:

1.)  To be considered qualified the instructor must have the following:
  Certified Flight Instructor Certificate
  10 years of training in the Convair 580  
  10 years of experience flying the Convair 580 

2.)  For the FAAs pilot recurrent training it is imperative that the ground instructor be thoroughly familiar with the FAAs unique CV580 aircraft systems and the impact of these systems in dealing with normal, abnormal, and emergency procedures. 

The ground instructor must possess comprehensive knowledge of the following:

  Honeywell electronic flight information system (EFIS)
  GPS and inertial navigation integrated with the FMSs, 
  Traffic alert and collision system (TCAS), 
  Automatic Dependence Surveillance (ADS-B) equipment
  Dual digital air data computer (ADC) systems

Submission Requirements & Instructions:

Interested vendors must demonstrate their capabilities to meet the requirements as outlined above in their response to this market survey.  Responses must be no longer than three (3) pages in length.  In particular, the response must demonstrate knowledge and experience required in Course Requirements #1, and Instructor Requirements #1 & 2 as outlined above.  In addition to the three (3) page response, vendors must also submit a copy of their Certified Flight Instructor Certificate.

<p>IT SECURITY PROVISIONS AND 508 COMPLIANCE LANGUAGE IS ALREADY OBTAINED FROM PREVIOUS CONTRACT</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis without providing for full and open competition to Biofortis Inc., 10320 Little Patuxent Parkway, Suite 410, Columbia, Maryland 21044 for a renewal Labmatrix Software Subscription for users engaged in client study.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procurement</span>:</p>
<p>This is a Follow-On Requirement.</p>
<p>1. Labmatrix software subscription for Users engaged in a Client Study;<br />2. License to 3rd party software for Barcode Printing; and<br />3. Custom development and ad hoc services.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. To that end NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Computational and Statistical Genomics Branch (CSGB) research focuses on the development and application of computationally intensive approaches to analyze large-scale genetic and genomic data, with a particular focus on identifying genetic contributions to human disease. CSGB investigators specialize in statistical genetics and genetic epidemiology. These disciplines combine statistics, epidemiology, mathematics, molecular genetics and computer science to identify genetic variants responsible for increased susceptibility to disease and variation of phenotypic traits. <br /><br />CSGB scientists conduct studies aimed at understanding complex genetic diseases and developing new statistical methods and software to analyze data sets emanating from large-scale genetic association and linkage studies. They also use innovative approaches to distinguish genuine genetic influences from random background noise. As computational biologists, they employ comparative genomic approaches to understand the evolution and function of protein families and their ultimate role in human disease.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives</span>:</p>
<p>Labmatrix license software proprietary to Biofortis Inc. is critical to assuring the continued success of the NHGRI clinical research program. In addition, funding of custom development and other database services performed by BioFortis Inc. is essential to providing the specialized data management needs of NHGRI clinical research investigations. The Labmatrix software that was designed by Biofortis, Inc. has been customized specifically for NHGRI to meet and support specifications to specific research projects being conducted by NHGRI investigators.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Important Considerations</span>:</p>
<p>Labmatrix is used to manage clinical research protocols and store many types of clinical data, including patient data imported from the NIH CRIS data warehouse. The renewal of the Labmatrix license is critical to assuring the continued success of the NHGRI clinical research program. In addition, funding of Custom development and other database services performed by BioFortis is essential to providing for the specialized data management needs of NHGRI clinical research investigators. Nearly one hundred NHGRI users, Labmatrix is currently being utilized in conjunction with 30 active IRB-approved clinical protocols and supports large-scale clinical research projects such as the ClinSeq Project and the Undiagnosed Diseases Program.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a sole source contract to the Boeing Company to procure the integration of Increment 3 capabilities and architecture upgrades into the P-8A aircraft.
<p>NAVAIR intends to negotiate and award the contract utilizing other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority at FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".</p>
<p>Pursuant to DFARS 206.302-1(d) and PGI 206.302, a sources sought notice was posted for this requirement.</p>
<p>This effort will consist of integration and test of several GFE systems, while maintaining a consistent Integrated Logistics Support strategy and engineering discipline of the P-8 baseline program. In order to perform under the planned contract actions, an alternate source would require access to technical data associated with the P-8A Increment 3 efforts that has been, or will be developed by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (Boeing) during the System Requirements Review and Critical Design Review Capabilities Integration. NAVAIR does not have unlimited rights in this data. Additionally, any alternate source would be required to begin the Platform Integration effort by the 3rd quarter of FY17 and complete it by 1st quarter FY23.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Capability statements were previously requested and considered by the agency under the sources sought synopsis posted to FBO on 16 September 2015. <br />Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Boeing directly via Ms. Laura Ford at <br />(253)657-5151 or laura.a.ford@boeing.com.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR SUBPART 6.1 FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. This procurement will use the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases.

The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for the design and construction of P-222 E-LMR Slice Communication Towers at Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center (MCMWTC) Bridgeport, California.
 The project includes the design and construction of five new E-LMR communication towers in various locations throughout the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center Bridgeport area.

The Phase One evaluation will result in a determination of the most highly qualified Offerors.
 These Offerors will be requested to submit a Phase Two proposal. A maximum of five Offerors will be selected to submit a Phase Two proposal unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than five is in the Governments interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design-build contracting.

THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The Phase One RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at www.neco.navy.mil on or about 15 October 2015.

<DESC>The General Services Administration is requesting proposals from electric generation suppliers to provide electric power supply to Federal accounts in New York.  The electric requirements are all behind Consolidated Edison, NYSEG and National Grid  service territories.  The Government has divided its electric requirement into five (5) pricing groups.  The successful offeror(s) will supply all electricity components for the respective pricing groups.  Deliveries will begin with the May/June 2016 meter read date for all accounts unless otherwise specified.   The contract terms will range from twenty-four (24) to thirty-six (36) months.  A six (6) month extension period is included in the contract. The approximate total annual electric requirement is 220,000 MWhs divided among the five (5) pricing groups.   The pricing groups will have varying renewable power content requirements.  Pricing Groups will fix all of the energy pricing components.  For all pricing groups the price offered will apply to all accounts in each pricing group and that price will remain fixed for the contract term.  Multiple awards will be considered.  Offerors are not required to offer pricing for all pricing groups.  All pricing groups are available on a full and open competition basis.  This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis.  The procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP) conducted in accordance with Part 12 (Commercial Item) of the FAR. This announcement constitutes the presolicitation notice and the synopsis. The Government intends to award a contract(s) to the offeror that offers the lowest evaluated price for each pricing group and term that meets the solicitation's technical requirements (see solicitation for specific details).  Supplier technical responses to the solicitation are due no later than 2:00 p.m. on November 4, 2015 via email to the Contracting Officer (see solicitation instructions).  Pricing will be submitted in accordance with the solicitation on November 10, 2015 via online reverse auction procedures (see solicitation instructions).

Suppliers interested in obtaining authorization to pull account data from the local utility should contact Mr. Shutika.

All contractor personnel working classified task orders must have, as a minimum, a SECRET clearance. <br>  <br> NOTE:  The NAICS Code being considered for this requirement is 541330.  <br>  <br> Your response shall include documentation of technical expertise and capability in sufficient detail.  This information will help  the Government in determining  if your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition, as it relates to the questions defined below. It is imperative that businesses responding to this SSN use their page space wisely and articulate their capabilities clearly and adequately.  Additionally, please provide the following company specific information:  <br>  <br>    Your System for Award Management (SAM) number, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code number and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. <br>  <br>    A point of contact (POC) name, telephone number and e-mail address.  <br>  <br>    Identify if you are a small business under the NAICS code 541330. (38.5M) <br>  <br> Market Research Questions:  <br>  <br> a. If the Government was to execute this under an incentive based contract, what ways would you incentivize the work performed on this effort? <br>  <br> b. What do you think is the most challenging part of this effort and what steps can the Government take to help mitigate some of the risks associated with the challenges?   <br>  <br> c. What recent relevant performance (past three (3) years) and/or current work experience does your company have performing to deliver the services and products (to include constructive training products identified above) on Government contracts of this magnitude and scope?  An agency may properly consider the experience or past performance of parent or affiliated companies and as such, all past performance will be identified as to the parent company submitting response or an affiliated or sister company. Give specific examples.  <br>  <br> d. Please explain your process for securing supplemental staff and other resources necessary to successfully perform on a potential contract, on occasions when presented with multiple requirements. (i.e. fielding hardware to extra sites, two simultaneous training events that require exercise support, Testing and fielding IAVA patches, and distributing a JLCCTC version release all within a year or six month time frame). Is your company capable of providing qualified and experience personnel at appropriate security levels?  Please explain. <br>  <br> e. Small businesses must comply with FAR 52.219-14 - Limitation of Subcontracting, regarding contract performance (at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern). Is your company capable of providing a team composition that can support the entire scope of this contract effort with sufficient depth to perform the variety of tasks of varying complexity while performing at least 50 percent of the work as the prime?  Please explain. <br>  <br> f. Are there any financial constraints that would prevent you from purchasing equipment ahead of time?  Can you elaborate on your ability to procure the necessary capital that may be required for advanced purchases. Is there anything the Government can do to help offset the time between advanced purchases and payments made to the contractor team (i.e. Do progress payments help)? <br>  <br> g. Please explain your capability and capacity to properly handle and control classified documents, or by what means would you secure such facilities? <br>  <br> h. Please explain your capability and capacity to potentially procure and store large amounts of hardware in anticipation of delayed fieldings.  <br>  <br> i. What experience do you have in providing IAVA patches and ensuring these updates are properly applied on a closed network?   <br>   <br> j. Please provide examples where you were required to provide Help Desk support and training given some of the challenges the current environment presents. (e.g. Fieldings don't always sync up with exercises; frequent personnel turn-around at user sites; users circumvent the Help Desk; lack of incentive for users to retain knowledge in-house).  <br>  <br> k. How would you manage the CTS effort described above differently once JLCCTC transitions to a cloud-based solution?   Although the end-state of this migration is unknown at the moment, please assume JLCCTC components are running on virtual machines on a private cloud in a closed network.  What can you do before migration that may help ease transition?  <br>  <br> Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not reimburse any contractor for any information or administrative costs incurred in the response to this SSN; all costs associated with responding to this SSN will be borne solely by the interested party. Not responding to this SSN does not preclude participation in any future RFP or other solicitation, if any are issued.

<DESC><strong>Introduction</strong>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The mission of the Division of AIDS (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is to increase the knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of HIV, to support the advancement of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and to support the development of HIV/AIDS vaccines and other prevention measures. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS) supports the advancement of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and supports the development of HIV/AIDS vaccines and other prevention measures. Through grants and contracts, DAIDS sponsors Phase I, II, III and IV clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutics, vaccines and other preventive modalities. DAIDS has designed, developed and sponsored extramural Clinical Trial Networks, supported investigator-initiated clinical trials, and partnered with other Government and private organizations, in order to accomplish the Division's scientific objectives. Currently, NIAID/DAIDS supports more than 150 clinical trials in over 17 countries, at more than 110 domestic and international clinical sites.</p>
<p>As the Investigational New Drug (IND) Application sponsor for a large number of NIAID/DAIDS-funded clinical trials, NIAID/DAIDS is required to monitor clinical trials, in order to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, including Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 312 and Human Subjects Protection Title 45 CFR Part 46. Clinical trials are also monitored in accordance with the E6 International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practices (ICH/GCP). Over the past six years, approximately 90 monitors have performed more than 8,000 monitoring trips to over 200 clinical sites, in over 20 countries.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the proposed contract will be to continue to provide comprehensive clinical site and study monitoring services for the NIAID/DAIDS clinical trial research portfolio, including the delivery of monitoring services for unanticipated DAIDS clinical research projects that may be required in response to emerging needs or public health emergencies.</p>
<p>The current NIAID/DAIDS Clinical Site Monitoring contract was awarded to Pharmaceutical Product Development, LLC, Wilmington, NC, on February 1, 2010, for a total period of seven years.<br /><br />The Government anticipates a potential need to increase the level of effort, for the following reasons, which are also within the scope of the contract: (1) increased level of effort, in order to support unanticipated needs; and (2) increase level of effort, in order to support the Provision of Site Performance Risk-Based Monitoring tool. Increases in effort for these services would be implemented through the exercise of contract options, at the discretion of the Government.<br /><br /><strong>Project requirements</strong></p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor will be responsible for the following:</p>
<p>1. Conduct site initiation visits prior to clinical trial implementation to ensure compliance with DAIDS, U.S., and, where appropriate, country-specific regulatory requirements and guidelines.</p>
<p>2. Conduct routine site monitoring visits for active clinical trials to ensure compliance with DAIDS, U.S. and where appropriate, country-specific regulatory requirements and guidelines, verify the accuracy and completeness of clinical trial data, and assess adherence to protocol-specific requirements.</p>
<p>3. Conduct specialized site monitoring visits for a variety of purposes, including regulatory audits, assessments of overall and protocol-specific research pharmacy operations and management of investigational products, and remedial or for cause site visits to implement and ensure adherence to corrective actions required to address site or study deficiencies identified through routine site monitoring.</p>
<p>4. Conduct site closeout visits to ensure appropriate completion of clinical trials, storage of clinical records and disposition of investigational products.</p>
<p>5. Prepare written reports on all site monitoring visits, including identification of problems and deficiencies and recommendations for remedial/corrective actions.</p>
<p>6. Develop and implement Standard Operating Procedures for the conduct of clinical site monitoring functions, including the components to be reviewed/assessed and the processes to be used for each type of site visit.</p>
<p>7. Communicate and coordinate clinical site and study monitoring activities and data generated through these activities with other DAIDS clinical research support contractors and HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials Network components.</p>
<p>8. Develop and implement a Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) Plan to ensure the efficient and effective performance of monitoring functions and the appropriate management of the project.</p>
<p>9. Ability to remotely interact with various NIAID systems such as the NIAID-Clinical Research Management System (N-CRMS).</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated period of performance</strong></p>
<p>It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, level-of-effort (term) type contract will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one (1) year (Base Period) plus six (6) one-year options (terms) that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally, for a total possible performance period of seven (7) years, beginning on or about December 1, 2016.</p>
<p><br />The requirement will be for the delivery of sixty-two (62) full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the Base Period (Year 1) and sixty-two (62) FTEs per year for Options 1-6 (Years 2-7).</p>
<p>In addition, the Government may exercise options for an increased level of effort to support the following: (1) unanticipated increases in demand for the activities supported by the base requirements of this contract; and (2) the development or adaptation (including the maintenance of) a commercially available system, in order to implement site performance risk-based monitoring.</p>
<p>These Options are defined as follows:</p>
<p>Options 7-8, 10-11, 13-14, 16-17, 19-20, 22-23 and 25-26 - Increased Level of Effort for Unanticipated Increases in Demand: During the course of the contract, it may be necessary to increase the level of effort, in order to support unanticipated increases in demand for the activities supported by the base requirements of the contract. Such an increase would require an increase in the Contractor's activities, to be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as an Option. If the Government elects to exercise this Option, the Contractor shall provide an additional five (5) FTEs per option. Up to two options of this type may be exercised in any one year. The period of performance of an Option for Increased Services will not exceed the term of the Base year or Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>
<p>Options 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 and 27 - Increased Level of Effort for Unanticipated Increases in Demand: During the course of the contract, it may be necessary to increase the level of effort, in order to support unanticipated increases in demand for the activities supported by the base requirements of the contract. Such an increase would require an increase in the Contractor's activities, to be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as an Option. If the Government elects to exercise this Option, the Contractor shall provide an additional ten (10) FTEs per option. One option of this type may be exercised in any one year. The period of performance of an Option for Increased Services will not exceed the term of the base year or Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>
<p>Options 28 and 29, and 30-34 - Increased Level of Effort for the Provision of a Site Performance Risk-Based Monitoring tool: During the course of the contract, it may be necessary to increase the level of effort in order to support the provision of a site performance risk-based monitoring tool. Such an increase would require an increase in the Contractor's activities, to be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as an Option. The system should provide the ability to identify and weigh key risk factors that may have the greatest impact on participant safety and data integrity, ability to define threshold levels for risk factors and "flag" sites (i.e. green-yellow-red system) that fall outside of pre-determined levels for high, medium and low risk. In addition, the system should provide "real-time" reports, to allow for the identification of site quality and compliance risks, so that objective decisions can be made regarding frequency, degree, and type of monitoring visits (i.e., remote or on-site) for clinical research sites. The system should be flexible enough to accommodate any changes in business processes, and provide a variety of reports. Once developed and ready for production, the application will be hosted in the NIAID Office of Cyber Infrastructure and Computational Biology (OCICB) computing environment. The Contractor will communicate and collaborate with the OCICB, in order to determine the requirements for data transfer, to ensure compatibility with the OCICB computing environment.</p>
<p>Development Phase (Options 28-29): During contract years 2 and/or 3, the government may exercise options (Option 28 and/or 29), in order to support the development or adaptation of a commercially available system, in the N-CRMS or as a stand-alone system, in order to implement site performance risk-based monitoring (it is anticipated that the "development phase" should last approximately 1-2 years). Should the Government elect to exercise Option 28 and/or 29 (Development), the Contractor shall provide resources for the increase in work volume by two (2) FTEs for each option. The period of performance of an Option for Increased Services will not exceed the term of the Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>
<p>Maintenance Phase (Options 30-34): Beginning in contract year 3 or 4 (depending on when the development phase is complete) and through contract year 7, the system would be in a "maintenance phase", and the government may exercise options (Options 30-34) to support this maintenance. Should the Government elect to exercise Options 30-34 (Maintenance), the Contractor shall provide resources for the increase in work volume by one (1) FTE for each option. The period of performance of an Option for Increased Services will not exceed the term of the Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), has a requirement for facilitation services for strategic planning sessions with the Office of Railroad Policy. In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the contracting officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.
<p>Only once source is available because this action is a follow on action to DTFR53-14-P-00019. That purchase order was awarded to Envisions Consulting via the competitive procedures in FAR part 13. Envisions has developed expertise in RPD's strategic vision that cannot be duplicated by another contractor. Additionally, Envisions has developed trust with key members of the RPD team that allows a more open communication. Lastly, competition would not recoup the expense of holding the previous meetings again.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:<br /><br />The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) is a water management agency with 600 dams in 17 western states. BOR is requesting a Time-and-Materials / Labor Hours contract with a base year plus the option to exercise four (4) additional years with a start date of 12/1/2015 through 11/30/2020 under NAICS Code 517210. BOR is requesting a wireless carrier that will provide 4 G voice for all current and new smart phones; unlimited texting and data for current and new cellular phones; data services for new and current iPads, aircards and MiFi's to include services for current and new telemetry lines. The mission requires travel and communication throughout the United States and to remote locations on a daily basis. BOR needs a cellular provider that has the capability to provide reliable nationwide coverage 24 hours, 7 days a week. BOR travels to international locations for business and conferences. To ensure communication is still available without interruption, international SIM cards shall be provided for specific usage, as well as a line provisioning plan as requested. The contractor shall have the ability to enable their devices to leverage each other's networks in specific locations where one carrier may not have coverage built or may not be licensed to build coverage. <br /><br />If firms believe they have the technical capability to meet this need, submit a technical capability statement along with business profile to Mr. Victor McCoy at vmccoy@usbr.gov within 3 days of this notice. Any information received will be treated as market research information towards future similar or same requirement. Quotations or proposals received in response to this notice will not be accepted since this synopsis is not a request for quote or a request for proposal.  <br />

<p>A security pre-clearance must be performed for any employees referred to IHS through this contract.<br />Fingerprints must be completed and adjudicated prior to services being performed under this contract.<br />No contract award shall be made to any vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov throughout the duration of the contract. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the acquisition official if there is a change in provider.<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.<br />In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.<br />The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.<br />Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your proposal must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFP. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC)<br />LRS Product Line Division<br />1060 Consolidated Road<br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909<br />Primary POC: Josh Stoddard, Contract Specialist at Joshua.M.Stoddard@uscg.mil <br />Secondary POC: Catrina McDonald, Contract Specialist at Catrina.M.McDonald@uscg.mil <br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. Some of these USPSCs serve on intermittent contracts and are referred to in OTI as "bullpenners," providing support in a surge capacity. Those serving in the bullpen must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparation. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Senior Management Advisor is an expert in the multitude of functions that comprise program operations and management for USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives programs in Washington, D.C. and occasionally in the field.  The Senior Management Advisor provides services which require the highest level of professionalism, knowledge, diplomacy, and expertise.  This individual must be readily available to provide the required services on an intermittent basis, often on short notice with little time for preparation.  From time to time, the Senior Management Advisor may be requested to travel to OTI field offices, which are located in countries with complex problems, often in difficult and harsh environments, with some offices located in countries with no other USAID presence.  However, the majority of the incumbent's time will be spent at OTI headquarters in Washington, D.C.  The Senior Management Advisor reports to the Chief of OTI's Operations and Management Division or his/her designee which may be the Chief of Field Programs Division or Country Team Leaders, and spends his or her time working side by side with OTI Washington, D.C. staff and with country program implementation teams in the Field.  All of the field activities supported and the majority of the headquarters activities supported are transition program implementation-focused.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Senior Management Advisor is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>

<p>&bull;	When required, step into a range of roles, including program management, operations support, and oversight roles, as well as the highest of leadership and management positions in OTI, helping to fill program implementation and management gaps to ensure that OTI programs continue to run smoothly;</p>
<p>&bull;	Review field staff mixes with the OTI country team for both the ongoing OTI program staff and the ongoing OTI implementing partner staff to ascertain that field staff requirements are adequate, and review the preparation of staff training plans to ensure that they are adequate and that they are fully implemented in support of transition programs, and conduct training for OTI and implementing partner staff as needed;</p>
<p>&bull;	Develop and provide training for headquarters and field staff (both U.S. and foreign national as well as implementing partner staff on the ground) as needed to ensure that OTI staff are in compliance with OTI policies as well as Agency regulations;</p>

This includes ensuring that residential housing for OTI field staff (90% of whom are program funded), including furnishings and equipment, are adequate and consistent with Post policy; and ensuring that OTI program-funded vehicles are being maintained and operated in accordance with established guidelines (for vehicles purchased by the OTI contractor, ensure that the contractor is maintaining and operating them in accordance with their contract);</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>Submittals;<br />It is incumbent upon the offeror to submit sufficient information for the Government to make a determination of your technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance and price.

<p>The Government's approach to evaluating past performance is to check the references provided by the contractor to verify satisfactory past performance as well as data obtained from other sources available i.e. government database, past contract files, etc. The offeror is cautioned that while the Government will consider data from other sources, the burden of demonstrating satisfactory past performance rests with the offeror.</p>

<p>Solicitation Number: FA8617-15-R-6199 15 July 2015</p>
<p>The purpose of this SSS Amendment is to provide Industry a REVISED PWS due to significant changes of requirements. The original SSS posted on 26 May 2015 remains applicable.</p>
<p>1. This SSS amendment and the attached revised Performance Work Statement (PWS) describe an acquisition strategy for an anticipated CLS/Maintenance Training program for the Afghan Trainer Program in Afghanistan. Vendors are encouraged to carefully review the entire PWS as there are multiple changes made throughout the PWS. The changes are too numerous to specify individually.

<p>This CLS/Maintenance Training contract will consist of the following Period of Performance (PoP) of one (1) 12 month base with four (4) x one (1)/year Options:</p>
<p>&bull;&middot; Base: 01 Jul 2016 -30 Jun 2017</p>
<p>&bull;&middot; Option 1: 01 Jul 2017 -30 Jun 2018</p>
<p>&bull;&middot; Option 2: 01 Jul 2018 -30 Jun 2019</p>

<p>&bull;&middot; Option 4: 01 Jul 2020 -30 Jun 2021</p>
<p>3. Capability Survey Questions - Industry should respond to the additional questions listed below. Industry need not respond to the original questions in the original SSS posted on 26 May 2015.</p>
<p>1. There will be contract CLINs for transferring 2, 4, and/or 6 aircraft per year to AAF responsibility. Describe your approach for supporting the drawdown of USG aircraft support if any of these CLINs are exercised. See PWS paragraph 1.2.1.</p>
<p>2. Describe your approach to measure On-The-Job (OJT) training to prepare AAF students for the next level of instruction.</p>
<p>3. Describe your concept to flexibility for supporting 40 hours/aircraft/month during fighting season, 20 hours/aircraft/month during non-fighting season with 25% surge capability along with supporting AAF responsible aircraft maintenance, supplemental training and contingency operations. See PWS paragraph 1.2.2.</p>
<p>4. Describe your approach to performing maintenance of AAF responsible aircraft IAW PWS paragraph 3.2.4.</p>
<p>5. Remobilization. Since Afghanistan is an unstable environment there is the possibility that the contractor would have to relocate to another base during the contract period. The contractor can assume that the same level of government furnished services/supplies will be at the new location. Please provide your concerns, if any, to the following scenarios for relocating from Kandahar to another coalition base in a region.</p>
<p>Scenario #1: All nine (9) C208B aircraft located at Kandahar will move to the new base, along with tools, support equipment, and contractor personnel.</p>
<p>Scenario #2: All nine (9) C208B aircraft located at Kandahar will remain and transition to "AAF responsible" aircraft. The contractor will provide tools and support equipment for purchase by the USG to provide to the AAF for support of the 9 aircraft. The contractor will adjust the number of FAA Airframe &amp; Power plant certified mechanics appropriately to service the smaller fleet size of USG responsible aircraft while retaining the capability to support any requests for the increased size of the AAF responsible fleet. The contractor personnel will move to the new base.</p>

<DESC>AMD 04<br />Access Control - Industry Day<br />Global Enterprise Fabric <br />Special Notice: W91RUS16GEF1<br />as of 13 October 2015
<p><br />Reference: Access Control for Industry Day on 15 October 2015</p>
<p>Please see the following link for installation access:<br />http://www.huachuca.army.mil/pages/des/accesscontrol.html</p>
<p>Visitors, contractors and vendors 18 years and older, entering Fort Huachuca, who do not have a DoD identification card, will be subject to a background check before being allowed entry to the installation. Those who present a common access card (CAC card), Military ID, Military Dependent ID, Gold Star ID, or other valid DoD credential won't be affected. This is to ensure that Fort Huachuca is in compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12, which requires that 100 percent of visitors be vetted prior to entering the installation. While this is a DoD-wide initiative, we are doing all we can to streamline the process for accessing Fort Huachuca yet ensure the safety and security of the installation.</p>
<p>Please note, attendees will also be required to go through an access control point in Greely Hall. The attendee's name, company name and CAGE Code will be verified against the attendance roster using the attendee's Government Identification (normally a U.S. based driver's license) at the Greely Hall access control point.</p>
<p>The Industry Day will begin at 09:00 (AZ/Local Time). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>**Arriving after 09:00 (AZ/Local Time) will put an attendee at risk of not being allowed access into Greely Hall.**</strong></em></span></p>

<DESC><strong>Registrations for the wait list for Industry Day are no longer being accepted effective October 16, 2015.</strong> Full seating capacity has been reached and there are approximately 60 personnel on the current wait list. There have been few cancellations so it is unlikely seats will be available for the event.&nbsp;<strong>As a reminder, due to security reasons, walk-ins will not be permitted.</strong>
<p><strong>Other reminders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The event is free of charge, however it is not intended to be a showcase for industry presentation of their capabilities so no booths will be displayed. The Government will not hear formal bids from industry, no site visits will be conducted at this time, nor will one-on-one or group meetings be held at this time. The purpose of this event is for only the Government to present information. Slides for the event will be posted to FBO afterward. Registrants with confirmed reservations should have received directions to Ft. Huachuca, AZ; directions to Greely Hall; directions to various post facilities where food and drink can be purchased at lunch time; and instructions on how to enter post since there have recently been significant changes to installation access on Ft. Huachuca, AZ. <strong>Please bring these with you as printed material or escorts on post will NOT be provided by ACC-APG Huachuca Division. An updated agenda will be posted as soon as possible prior to the event.<br /><br />Additional information.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following items are not allowed in the Greely Hall Auditorium:&nbsp; cell phones, pagers, recording devices, photographic devices, laptops, PDA devices, other electronic devices so please do not bring them in with you.&nbsp; The Government is not responsible for lost, stolen, or damaged property.&nbsp; &nbsp; </strong></p>

<a href="mailto:corretta.benton@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training & Instrumentation is seeking capability information from industry for consideration during development of an acquisition strategy to obtain necessary personnel, material, equipment, facilities, and services to provide training and support the development of Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability (JLCCTC). The focus of the contract is to ensure rapid, cost effective, and streamlined contracting for delivery of JLCCTC training products/services to meet the immediate needs of the Warfighter.    <br>    <br>  NOTE: Battle Command Training Capability - Equipment Support (BCTC-ES) will be executed under a different solicitation.  <br>    <br>  The following identifies the business areas for which the requirements apply.  <br>    <br>     Training JLCCTC applications and providing supplemental training aids to support training needs.  <br>    <br>     CBCSE procurement and distribution to 50+ locations worldwide.   <br>    <br>     JLCTCC software/hardware fielding activities to include end-to-end set up, test, train, transfer, and follow-up support.  <br>    <br>     Help Desk support activities to include telephonic support, e-mail support, and exercise support.  <br>    <br>     Information Assurance and Vulnerability Assessment (IAVA) updates and distribution to supported sites.   <br>    <br>    <br>  The anticipated JLCCTC TSS contract will be used by PEO STRI to provide sustainment,  Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS), and hardware acquisition and fielding in support of the JLCCTC program.  Development of JLCCTC software updates and patches, other than IAVA, are not included in the scope of this contract (already provided under separate JLCCTC development contract).    <br>    <br>  It is anticipated that JLCCTC TSS will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) single award contract having a period of performance of five (5) years.  The Government seeks a highly qualified, capable contractor who has experience with rapidly and credibly providing task-specific CTS solutions in the form of a broad range of training systems and products, to meet Warfighter training requirements.  The specific work to be performed will be ordered by issuance of delivery/task orders and/or Performance Specification/Training System Requirements Documents (TSRD) for each specific requirement.  PEO STRI intends to procure the following services and products under a single award ID/IQ contract:  <br>    <br>  Services and Products to include:  <br>    <br>  (1)  Common Hardware Platform (CHP) hardware and software procurement.  <br>  (2)  Server Refresh  <br>  (3)  Hardware Cost Benefit Analysis Plans  <br>  (4)  Configuration Management of fielded JLCCTC software  <br>  (5)  Web Based Training (WBT)  <br>  (6)  Instructor Led Training (ILT)  <br>  (7)  Job Aids  <br>  (8)  IAVA Patch Management, consisting of consolidation and distribution to the  field after successful testing.  <br>  (9)  Tele-training/teleconferencing  <br>  (10) Maintenance for distributed learning courses and courseware components to provide for rapid update to address short- term emerging requirements.  <br>  (11) Exercise technical support  <br>  (12) Exercise operational support (tying the software to the training objectives)  <br>    <br>  Additional Information:  <br>    <br>  In performance of this contract, the Contractor will be required to receive and generate classified material.  The contractor will require access to a contractor managed Integrated Fielding Facility with a Defense Security Service Certification and Accreditation. The contractor will be required to have limited personnel with TOP SECRET (TS/SCI) facility clearance with SECRET safeguarding capability limited to 2 cubic feet of material/documents.  All contractor personnel working classified task orders must have, as a minimum, a SECRET clearance.  <br>    <br>  NOTE:  The NAICS Code being considered for this requirement is 541330.   <br>    <br>  Your response shall include documentation of technical expertise and capability in sufficient detail.  This information will help  the Government in determining  if your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition, as it relates to the questions defined below. It is imperative that businesses responding to this SSN use their page space wisely and articulate their capabilities clearly and adequately.  Additionally, please provide the following company specific information:   <br>    <br>      Your Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code number and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Please ensure your company is registered in System for Award Management)  <br>    <br>     A point of contact (POC) name, telephone number and e-mail address.   <br>    <br>     Identify if you are a small business under the NAICS code 541330. (38.5M)  <br>    <br>  Market Research Questions:   <br>    <br>  a. If the Government was to execute this under an incentive based contract, what ways would you incentivize the work performed on this effort?  <br>    <br>  b. What do you think is the most challenging part of this effort and what steps can the Government take to help mitigate some of the risks associated with the challenges?    <br>    <br>  c. What recent relevant performance (past three (3) years) and/or current work experience does your company have performing to deliver the services and products (to include constructive training products identified above) on Government contracts of this magnitude and scope?  An agency may properly consider the experience or past performance of parent or affiliated companies and as such, all past performance will be identified as to the parent company submitting response or an affiliated or sister company. Give specific examples.   <br>    <br>  d. Please explain your process for securing supplemental staff and other resources necessary to successfully perform on a potential contract, on occasions when presented with multiple requirements. (i.e. fielding hardware to extra sites, two simultaneous training events that require exercise support, Testing and fielding IAVA patches, and distributing a JLCCTC version release all within a year or six month time frame). Is your company capable of providing qualified and experience personnel at appropriate security levels?  Please explain.  <br>    <br>  e. Small businesses must comply with FAR 52.219-14 - Limitation of Subcontracting, regarding contract performance (at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern). Is your company capable of providing a team composition that can support the entire scope of this contract effort with sufficient depth to perform the variety of tasks of varying complexity while performing at least 50 percent of the work as the prime?  Please explain.  <br>    <br>  f. Are there any financial constraints that would prevent you from purchasing equipment ahead of time?  Can you elaborate on your ability to procure the necessary capital that may be required for advanced purchases. Is there anything the Government can do to help offset the time between advanced purchases and payments made to the contractor team (i.e. Do progress payments help)?  <br>    <br>  g. Please explain your capability and capacity to properly handle and control classified documents, or by what means would you secure such facilities?  <br>    <br>  h. Please explain your capability and capacity to potentially procure and store large amounts of hardware in anticipation of delayed fieldings.   <br>    <br>  i. What experience do you have in providing IAVA patches and ensuring these updates are properly applied on a closed network?    <br>     <br>  j. Please provide examples where you were required to provide Help Desk support and training given some of the challenges the current environment presents. (e.g. Fieldings don't always sync up with exercises; frequent personnel turn-around at user sites; users circumvent the Help Desk; lack of incentive for users to retain knowledge in-house).   <br>    <br>  k. How would you manage the CTS effort described above differently once JLCCTC transitions to a cloud-based solution?   Although the end-state of this migration is unknown at the moment, please assume JLCCTC components are running on virtual machines on a private cloud in a closed network.  What can you do before migration that may help ease transition?   <br>    <br>  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not reimburse any contractor for any information or administrative costs incurred in the response to this SSN; all costs associated with responding to this SSN will be borne solely by the interested party. Not responding to this SSN does not preclude participation in any future RFP or other solicitation, if any are issued. However, the Government will use the information obtained to assist in developing an acquisition strategy and making a Small Business decision.  <br>    <br>  Disclaimer:  This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a RFP and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.  No solicitation documents exists at this time.  The submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.   <br>    <br>  Response Information Format:  Preferred method of submission is e-mail, but hardcopy submissions are acceptable.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is providing an update to the sources sought notice. The following changes to the scope of the effort are now in effect.  <br>  <br>  	JLCCTC TSS will change back to CBCSE to reflect the new scope of the effort. It is also the name of the official POR funding line. <br>   <br>  	It was implied, inaccurately, that the contractor would need roughly 10,000 square feet of space in order to store equipment. However, it is closer to 1000-2000 square feet of space needed to manage equipment.    <br>  <br>  	CBCSE will no longer focus on training.  JLCTCC Simulation software fielding activities to include end-to-end set up, test, train, transfer, and follow-up support will no longer be considered in this effort. <br>  <br>  	Help Desk support activities will no longer be considered in this effort.  <br>  <br>  	Information Assurance and Vulnerability Assessment (IAVA) updates and distribution to supported sites will no longer be considered in this effort. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> It is anticipated that CBCSE will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) single award contract having a period of performance of five (5) years.   <br>  <br> Please see below for the changes to the Products and Services from the original Sources Sought Notice: <br>  <br> (1)Common Hardware Platform (CHP) hardware and Commercial off the shelf (COTS) software license procurement. <br> (2)CHP and Server Refresh <br> (3)Hardware Cost Benefit Analysis Plans <br>  <br> Additional Information: <br>  <br> In performance of this contract, the Contractor will NO LONGER be required to receive and generate classified material.

Sessions concluded 16 June 2015. In the course of conducting sessions industry expressed an interest in providing demonstrations and/or additional information regarding its Management Information System (MIS) capabilities. The purpose of this announcement is to provide Contractor's the opportunity to demonstrate its MIS and provide information regarding its MIS capabilities. Receiving additional information, as well as demonstrations related to MIS capabilities will assist the Government with refining its critical MIS requirements for ATMP. <br /><br />2.

Requests will only be accepted if submitted electronically. Once received, a member of the ATMP team will contact you to arrange a specific time and date for the session.

No basis for a claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this announcement. <br /><br /><br /><br />1. UPDATE: 6 MAY 2015. The purpose of this message is to announce Government/Industry One-on-One sessions for the Army TADSS Maintenance Program (ATMP). The Government would like to conduct one session per day starting Monday 8 June 2015 from 12:30-2:30 EST. Sessions will conclude Friday 12 June 2015 unless additional sessions are required. The Government's preference is to conduct sessions at the Contractor's facility, however accommodations will be made at one of the Government's facilities if arrangements cannot be made at the Contractor's facility. Sessions will be no more than 2 hours and Contractor Representatives will be limited to 9 individuals (inclusive of Prime, Subcontractor and/or Teaming Members). The Government's preference is to hold sessions with Contractors that intend to submit proposals as a Prime Contractor for ATMP. However, the Government will not limit sessions exclusively to Prime Contractors. <br /><br />The intent of these sessions is to facilitate discussions regarding the ATMP acquisition and to encourage industry to ask questions related to the requirement. To that end the Government would like to provide a list of medium to high risk areas for discussion. These areas include: <br /><br />A. Depot Level Organic Support, Public Private Partnerships (PPP) PWS section 2.22 <br />B. Optimized maintenance and availability based on utilization <br />C. Phase In. PWS sec 3.1.2, 3.1.2.1, 3.1.2.2, 3.1.2.3, 3.1.2.4 <br />D. Actuals (e.g. cost impacts, format provided). PWS sec. 3.4.2.5 <br />E. Site visits (Where would you like to go? Ft. Hood, NTC?) <br />F. Management Information System (MIS). PWS sec. 3.4. and Appendix D <br />G. Failure Reporting, Analysis Corrective Action System (FRACAS)PWS sec. 3.2.1.2 <br />H. Diminishing Manufacturing Sources Material Shortages (DMSMS) PWS sec. 3.2.1.3 <br /><br />In addition to the above, the Government is willing to entertain any additional topics Contractors would like to discuss associated with ATMP requirement and/or source selection. However, as mentioned; the One-on-One sessions will be limited to no more than 2 hours. The Government requests Contractors submit questions associated with the One-on-Ones and/or risk areas identified above electronically no later than Friday 22 May 2015 at 4:00 p.m. Providing questions by this date will allow the Government to digest the questions and potentially provide a response during the sessions. Contractors are not required to submit questions prior to the session. However, the Government believes that providing questions will promote a meaningful exchange during the sessions. <br /><br />2. Contractors are advised that the above risk areas may or may NOT be areas that the Government will address as part of the ATMP Solicitation. In addition, the Government is bound by the Procurement Integrity Act (see far 3.104) to ensure that proprietary and/or company specific information is safeguarded. As such, the Government will not release any information that is determined to be proprietary to anyone outside the ATMP Integrated Product Team (IPT) or to any DoD or Non-DoD Contractors. However, non-proprietary information that is determined to be helpful to all interested parties, or will assist in clarifying or refining the ATMP requirements may be incorporated into the ATMP requirements and resultant Solicitation. <br /><br />3.

In addition, as discussed at the monthly Procurement Administrative Lead Time (PALT) Sessions, the ATMP Integrated Product Team (IPT) does not anticipate entering into PALT until 4th Quarter 2015. <br /><br />2. The IPT has updated the ATMP Live Training Transformation (LT2) Portal (https://www.lt2portal.org/) Collaboration Area to include information that was not provided in the previous ATMP Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Announcement posted 20 February 2015. The following files were added to the Collaboration Area. <br /><br />- Sustainable Range Program (SRP) work orders. <br />- Maintained systems that do not have assigned device numbers. <br />- Department of the Army Pamphlet 350-9 Index and Description of Army Training <br />Devices 2002, 2010 and DRAFT 2015. <br />- Details updated in README file. <br /><br />3. The Government is in the process of developing the Acquisition Strategy and would like to obtain feedback from Industry regarding the length of the ATMP Period of Performance (PoP). The Government anticipates a minimum PoP of 5 years, however; the Government would like to hear from industry regarding which duration (e.g. 5, 6,7,8,9 or 10 years) would allow Industry and the Government to obtain maximum efficiencies and provide industry with the ability to recoup its initial investment required to perform all tasks necessary to prepare for full performance. Responses to this PoP question are requested to be provided to the ATMP Mailbox (usarmy.orlando.peo-stri.mbx.atmp@mail.mil) no later than Wednesday 25 March 2015. The Government requests that Industry provide a specific duration (e.g. 9 years), in lieu of a range (e.g. 7-10 years), with rationale to support its position. Information provided from industry will be utilized as one data point amongst other historical data and market research to assist our IPT in determining the appropriate duration for ATMP. <br /><br />4. In addition to requesting feedback regarding the ATMP PoP, the Government is requesting feedback from industry regarding the posted DRAFT documents, as well as feedback regarding the information included in the ATMP LT2 Portal Collaboration Area. Specifically, there is a comment in the DRAFT PWS (Section 3.2.4) related to Beyond Economic Repair (BER). The current requirement states, quote mark the contractor's BER responsibility is limited to $35,000.00 USD per an individual TADSS hardware component. quote mark The Government is requesting feedback regarding potential impacts on a Contractor's pricing if this liability were eliminated. If eliminated, the Contractor would be responsible for all repairs regardless of component value. Again, please provide specifics if you choose to respond to this question. The Government requests that all questions, comments or suggestions for improvement for all information posted to LT2 Portal and FBO be provided to the ATMP mailbox usarmy.orlando.peo-stri.mbx.atmp@mail.mil by Friday 17 April 2015 at 4:00 P.M. This will NOT be industry's final chance to comment on the ATMP requirements. The Government anticipates conducting One-on-One sessions, Site Visits, as well as posting a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) prior to issuing the Final RFP. At this time there are no formal dates established for One-on-Ones, Site Visits or release of the Draft RFP. However, these venues will afford Industry with additional opportunity to pose questions regarding the ATMP requirements. It is advised that industry continue to monitor FBO and attend monthly ACC Orlando/PEO STRI PALT sessions for ATMP acquisition updates. <br /><br />5. DISCLAIMER: The information provided in this notice is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. This notice DOES NOT constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject services. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification. No basis for a claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this announcement. <br />

<DESC>         HOOF TRIMMING FOR WILD HORSES
Amendment 2 is to provide clarification identified at pre-bid conference.

Because the Bruneau Off Range Corrals is a new facility, the horses being received have come from other holding facilities and are already accustomed to a feedlot environment.  Most of the horses have recently trimmed hooves, so it is likely that hoof trimming services may be reduced during the first 6 months of the first year.

The government will not be supplying the grinders or blades, that is the responsibility of the contractor. 

If proposals are to be mailed or dropped off, you need to use the 1387 S. Vinnell Way, Boise address listed on the SF1449 form.  Bids will not be accepted that are delivered to the Bruneau Off Range Corral Facility


Pre-bid conference is scheduled for October 15 at 11:00 am MT at the Bruneau ORC Facility. There will only be one meeting scheduled.  It is not mandatory that you attend, but is highly recommended.

<SUBJECT>R--Warehouse Inventory Control - Logistics Management
<SOLNBR>R16PS00039
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<ARCHDATE>12152016
<CONTACT>Gates, Misty
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), Pacific Northwest Region, is seeking information regarding procurement strategies for the upcoming purchase of a Warehouse Inventory Control Management System (WICMS) for the facilities at Grand Coulee Dam.  The WICMS will be used to support the mission requirements of maintenance repair and logistical support at Grand Coulee.  This is not an Invitation for Bids (IFB), Request for Proposals (RFP), or Request for Quotations (RFQ).  Solicitation no. R16PS00039 was created as a means to issue this RFI  it will not carry forward to any future procurements.  Additionally, there is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any of the services/products described herein.  You will not be entitled to payment for any costs you incur in responding to this RFI.  The information obtained will be used by Reclamation in developing an acquisition strategy.

The intent of this RFI is to ascertain whether there is a logistics system currently on the market that can function as a comprehensive fully integrated WICMS solution.  The solution must provide organizational wide level integration and be inclusive of warehouse operations and inventory control management systems that support BORs critical mission to provide water supply and power generation.  The solution will need to be maintained on a local server; Cloud-based solutions will not work because they are a security risk.

In order to facilitate planning, drafting and publishing of a future RFP, respondents are being asked to provide their recommendations for optimal use of warehouse space, inventory control, and total asset visibility throughout the entire Grand Coulee project.  The process summaries included in the below background information provide a high-level overview of the key functions sought for implementation.  These are intended to assist respondents in presenting options for scoping the project and demonstrating the modules and features currently on the market that will be required for implementation.  Responses to this RFI need not be limited only to the information outlined.  Respondents should include recommendations for better business practices, Standard Operating Procedures, new technology and/or management tools that the respondent believes to be best suited as a solution.

Background.  BOR currently employs a staff of approximately 400 maintenance, engineering and technical employees who are responsible for buildings, utility, electrical and electronics, and power plant maintenance across the nations largest hydroelectric dam.  Staff maintenance and service responsibilities at the Grand Coulee Dam encompass approximately 15 square miles, and an estimated 440,000 square feet of building and facility space, and all facility access and support roads.  In addition, BOR utilizes several outside contractors to perform specialized work related to power generation and water supply.

In an average week, BORs warehouse group, which operates the warehouse service desk and call center, receives approximately 500 service calls from BOR staff and other users of the facilities.  In total these calls result in the creation of, on average, approximately 375 new work orders for reactive requests in the current system.  Beyond these work orders the respective maintenance shops also complete numerous preventive/scheduled maintenance activities that may or may not have an associated warehouse work order. 

Currently employees at Grand Coulee use CARMA and the Federal Business Management System (FBMS) as part of their inventory management for certain items. Items that are tracked in FBMS are those that are at a dollar threshold of $5,000.00 or, more or are deemed sensitive.  An Inventory Control Number (ICN) is associated to these items and they are then added to a Custodial Officers Account.  These items are inventoried annually with reports due back to the Regional Office for accountability sake.  CARMA is a maintenance management system that is used for tracking maintenance cost and scheduling.  It also has an inventory module however; it is not used to its full potential.  Some warehouse stocked items are loaded to this module when items have been received through the property office.  Warehousemen then show usage by removing those items from CARMA.  Tools and other equipment that fall below this dollar threshold are not tracked in either of these two systems but need to be tracked in some manner.

Based on information provided in response to this RFI, BOR presently plans to initiate a subsequent RFP solicitation process in which BOR will seek services to deploy a complete update of BORs obsolete warehouse and inventory control systems.  This update will not only unite the current non-integrated work order and materials management systems, but will also furnish additional, significantly more robust functionalities that will enable, facilitate, and support BORs larger Asset Management efforts.

Industry Day.  BOR intends to allow respondents to participate in an industry day to be held at Grand Coulee Power Office, Hwy 155 Grand Coulee, WA, 99133, on November 17, 2015 at         10:00 a.m PT.  The industry day will include an overview of BORs requirement, a tour of the site, and a question/answer session.  Respondents intending to attend the industry day must register by close of business on November 15, 2015.  Foreign Nationals shall submit a copy of their passport information no later than close of business on November 12, 2015.  Registration point of contact is Matt Tillman.  Mr. Tillman can be reached by telephone at (509) 633-9518 or by email at mtillman@usbr.gov.

SECURITY GUARD SERVICES

TOTAL SOCIALLY and ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGE BUSINESS (SEDB/8(a)) SET-ASIDE

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is announcing its plans for the acquisition of Security Guard Services for the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  The general scope of work for these Security Guard Services will require the contractor to procure armed guard services which provide physical security safeguards for FAA employees, information, facilities, United States government property and assets from loss, theft, damage, unauthorized use, criminal acts, espionage, sabotage, and terrorism.  Requirements are further defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The current version of the PWS is provided as a separate document under this announcement.   Services will be performed at the MMAC.  Interested parties are also encouraged to visit the MMAC Home Page. 

This acquisition will use streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) of 1997.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options.

The procurement action resulting from this Announcement/Screening Information Request (SIR) is contemplated as a set-aside for competitive award among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDBs) that are expressly certified by the SBA for participation in the SBAs 8(a) program.  To be considered, a vendor must be classified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services - $20.5/million.  Each firm claiming 8(a) status is required to provide a copy of its SBA 8(a) certification letter to the Contracting Officer with its response to this Announcement/SIR.  Firms are to submit an FAA Business Declaration form with your response to this Announcement/SIR.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each vendor's program eligibility.

In conjunction with the set-aside nature of the requirement, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  This requirement is found in AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting.  

The date and time for receipt of responses is 5:00 p.m. local time, October 16, 2015, (facsimile responses, paper copies, and zip files are not permitted).  Any responses received after 5:00 p.m., October 16, 2015, will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendors response may be determined unacceptable; therefore, not considered as one of the qualified companies.  Oral or written communications with offerors, during the screening process, will be conducted if the FAA deems communication is necessary.

<DESC>NRL is in possession of a prototype robot developed by Electromechanica, Inc. (EMI) and is tasked with conducting extensive experiments in order to define performance capability in relevant environments; however in order to evaluate the EMI prototype robot in increasingly more realistic environments, modifications, including testing of advanced software and improved hardware to environmentally seal the robot for use in realistic hostile environments are required. After initial laboratory testing of these aspects, modifications to the robot system will be provided to NRL for determination of system effectiveness and operational related parameters in increasingly more realistic environments. NRL conducted experiments will focus on performance factors such as in-pipe mobility and the ability for the robot to transport sensor package(s)or provide more information on pipe condition. Test matrices and hardware used in NRL experiments will be modified to incorporate results of the additional capabilities developed in this tasking.
<p><br />It is not the intent of this work to develop or evaluate alternative robotic systems but to provide modifications required for relevant environment experimentation of the EMI prototype robot. Tasks involve software and hardware upgrades and laboratory based experimentation. 4 tasks are defined and additional details are provided below:</p>
<p>1) Technical support for NRL experimentation,<br />2) Operation in wet/dirty environment (environmental sealing),<br />3) Operational stability through software and hardware error handling,<br />4) Improvements in linear actuation and maintainability.</p>
