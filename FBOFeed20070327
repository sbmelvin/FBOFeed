Proposals Due: Anytime between 27 March 2007 and 27 March 2009; Technical POC: 
Dr. Mark E. Davis, Deputy Director, DARPA/IXO; Phone (571) 218-4688.

BACKGROUND:  The Information Exploitation Office (IXO) of the Defense Advanced 
Research Project Agency (DARPA) solicits proposals for advanced research, 
development, and evaluation of information technologies and systems provide 
revolutionary improvements to our nation’s military capabilities to prosecute elusive 
surface targets.  The goal of this procurement is to obtain novel ideas for sensing, signal 
processing, target characterization, data fusion, target tracking, predictive awareness, 
battle management, collaborative planning, and visualization that can contribute to future 
conflict mitigation, warfighting and peacekeeping effectiveness.  Ideas can address 1) 
ways to employ emerging scientific or technical ideas to achieve significant increases in 
component performance; 2) novel combinations of existing technologies into systems that 
create new warfighting capabilities; or 3) combinations of both.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES/DESCRIPTION:  As a systems-oriented office, IXO is 
interested in both system concepts and enabling technologies that radically improve our 
armed forces’ capabilities to find, identify, track and engage surface targets, anywhere on 
the globe, in all environments, and at all times.  IXO’s interests focus on the most 
difficult and extreme military missions, including: 1) military operations in difficult 
environments, including forested, mountainous, and swampy terrain; 2) urban operations 
against regular military forces; 3) counter-insurgency operations against irregular forces 
and their infrastructure; and 4) providing security against maritime threats in open ocean 
and littoral regions.
DARPA/IXO is interested in proposals that combine emerging technologies with high-
payoff system applications.  Proposals that address any combination of technology and 
application that fall within IXO’s broad mission objectives may be submitted under this 
solicitation.

TECHNOLOGIES OF INTEREST:  Technologies that interest IXO include: 1) 
Advanced Sensors, 2) Sensor Processing, 3) Environmental Context Generation, 4) 
Target Discrimination, 5) Tracking, 6) Information Fusion, 7) Visualization / Immersive 
Operations, 8) Pattern Analysis, 9) Network Analysis, 10) Game Theory, 11) Social 
Modeling, 12) Planning and Control, 13) Collective Autonomy, 14) Dismount 
Automation, 15) Integrated Platforms, 16) Observables Management, 17) Very Large 
Databases, and 18) Human-computer Interaction.

SYSTEM APPLICATIONS OF INTEREST:  High payoff system applications that 
interest IXO include: 1) Rapidly Defeating Elusive Surface Targets, 2) Understanding of 
the 21st Century Battlespace, 3) Managing the Scale and Complexity of the Network-
centric Battlespace, 4) Combat ID of Individuals, 5) Getting Actionable Combat 
Information to the Busy Warfighter, 6) Obtaining Reliable Forensics in Cluttered 
Environments, and 7) Extending the Effective Line of Sight.  Further details on specific 
technology and application interest, program phases, selection criteria, and submission 
instructions may be found in the Proposer Information Package (PIP) which can be 
accessed at http://dtsn.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations.asp#0715.

TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INQUIRIES:  DARPA intends to use 
electronic mail for correspondence regarding BAA 07-15.  Technical, contractual, or 
administrative questions must be sent to BAA07-15@darpa.mil. Answers to all questions 
generally relevant to the technical, contractual, and administrative aspects of the 
solicitation will be posted at http://dtsn.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations.asp#0715 under 
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for public access.  In order to minimize unnecessary 
effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit 
abstracts in advance of full proposals.  DARPA will employ an electronic upload process 
for abstract/proposal submissions for BAA 07-15.  Performers may find guidance for 
abstract/proposal submission in the PIP at: 
http://dtsn.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations.asp#0715.  This BAA will remain open from 27 
March 2007 through 27 March 2009.  Throughout this period, DARPA will receive and 
review abstracts and/or proposals on a continuous basis and proposers are encouraged to 
submit innovative abstracts and/or proposals at any time during this period.  Please 
reference the PIP at http://dtsn.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations.asp#0715 for complete 
submission instructions.

OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION:  The Government reserves the right to select 
for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement 
and to award without discussions.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that 
shall be considered by DARPA.  Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to 
submit proposals and team with others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of 
this BAA will be set aside for HBCUs and MIs participation, due to the impracticality of

these entities.  Government contractors are required to register at the Government’s 
Central Contractor Registration site in order to negotiate contracts with most government 
agencies.  This URL is provided as a reference: http://www.ccr.gov.  Since this 
FedBizOpps Announcement, along with the PIP, constitutes a Broad Agency 
Announcement as contemplated in the FAR 6.102 (d)(2)(i), all prospective Proposers 
MUST also refer to the PIP before submitting a proposal.  Proposals MUST NOT be 
submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  Original Point of Contact:

<CONTACT>Martin Byrnes, Contracting Officer, Please contact Contract Specialist J. Heynes below., Martin.Byrnes@netl.doe.gov;Juliana Heynes, Contract Specialist, 412-386-4872, heynes@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>The Department of Energyâ€™s (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to issue a service contract on a sole source basis to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 which cites that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  CMU will provide professional services to update the computer program entitled, â€œIntegrated Environmental Control Modelâ€ (IECM); including the addition of new advanced energy technologies, implementation in a virtual engineering framework publication of model documentation, and associated outreach and technology transfer activities. NETL and CMU have collaborated on the development of the IECM over multiple years.  The objective of' the current work is to expand the capabilities of the Integrated Environmental Control Model (IECM) to allow for quick, accurate cost and environmental performance studies of' advanced energy technologies, including carbon capture and storage and virtual engineering applications. The IECM model was developed by Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), beginning in 1984 with a feasibility study.  Since that time, NETL analysts and CMU researchers have worked closely to keep the model up-to-date and to use it to perform analyses that evaluate the costs and performance of' environmental control technologies.  The model is publicly-available, fully documented, and easy-to-use.  As such, it is employed by industry as well as academia and governments. The IECM source code is the sole property of Carnegie Mellon University. Awarding this contract to an organization other than CMU would result in significant federal resources being used to reproduce work that has already been funded privately, and has already been completed. The substantial duplication of effort and cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Moreover, please note that this is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP) but rather a notice of NETLâ€™s intent to issue a sole source contract to CMU.

<RESPDATE>053007
<ARCHDATE>03262008
<CONTACT>Debra Velmere Contracting Officer 4157444140     ;
<DESC>A Firm Fixed Price construction contract is contemplated.  The parking lot for the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet was built about 30 years ago by placing fill in a tidal marsh.  It has settled over time and is now subjected to frequent tidal flooding.  The catch basin in the parking lot is approximately at elevation +4 ft MLLW and is connected by a 6 inch plastic pipe to an outfall at the southern edge of the parking lot.  High tides often are above elevation +5 and backflow of water from the marsh into the parking lot occurs.  This causes flooding around the catch basin which recedes when the tide elevation falls.  Flooding also occurs when the tide levels exceed the elevation of the ground at the perimeter of the parking lot.  The low point on the perimeter is currently at approximately elevation +5.5 and high tide levels about that occur several days a month and allow the parking lot to be flooded by water cascading into the parking area from the surrounding marsh.  The tide elevation for the 100-year storm is at elevation 8.5 ft MLLW and includes a 2.5 foot allowance for storm surge. Estimated cost is between $1,000.000 and $5,000.000.  Procurement is NOT Set-Aside as it is classified as NAISC 237990 OTHER HEAVY AND CIVIL ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION (EXCEPT DREDGING), a code not subject to any set aside under FAR 19.10 Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Size Standard is $31M. SIC is 1629 Flood Control Project Construction.  GENERAL:  SBRF is located approximately 4 1/2 miles north-east of Benicia, CA at the Lake Herman Road interchange to state highway 680. The work includes parking lot improvements that will provide flood protection and upgrade the pavement, lighting, and storage facilities in the parking lot, and provide best management practices for collection, treatment and discharge of stormwater.  The work includes, but is not limited to, the following: 1.   Mobilization and demobilization 2.   Demolition 3.   Flood Protection, Surface Water Control, and Dewatering 4.   Cement-Bentonite Cutoff Wall 5.   Floodwall Box 6.   Subdrains 7.   Stormwater Sump and Water Treatment Vault 8.   Floor Slabs and Miscellaneous Foundations 9.   Asphalt Paving 10. Electrical and Lighting 11. Storage Sheds, Guard Shack, Fencing, Flag Pole and Miscellaneous Items. A Pre-Bid Conference will be held; date yet to be announced.  Please contact the Contracting Officer if you are interested in receiving this Invitation for Bid. Please respond by April 20, 2007.  The IFB is tentatively scheduled to be issued April 30, 2007 or earlier and close May 30, 2007.  Tentative Delivery Date is expected to be by November 15, 2007.   You may email your request for the IFB to debbie.velmere@dot.gov.

<DESC>The government intends to award a firm-fixed price, sole-source contract pursuant to FAR Part 12.  Solicitation No. FA4479-07-R-0009 at McChord Air Force Base, WA. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Standard Industrial Code: 1731; NAICS: 238210; Size Standard $13,000,000.00.  The government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract sole-single source contract with ADVANTOR SYSTEMS CORPORATION, FL,  on or about 5 April 2007 for the purchase of the following:

Forty eight (48) separate CCTV cameras and one (1) thermal imaging camera will be divided into 15 Zones and located at strategic locations across the base. Video from the cameras will employ base networking infrastructure to reduce the amount of additional fiber infrastructure that would be required to support this system. CCTV video will be fed to four (4) 42” plasma monitors, located at the Security Forces Squadron Law Enforcement Desk. The intelligent video signal will also be processed through a “Dreambox” processor located near the ASN (Advantage Suite for Networks (ASN) Version 4.1) console. The CCTV system must be capable of outputting this processed signal to the preexisting ASN system for display, alarm notification and analysis. This will alert the base security forces of any condition within a CCTV detected alarm parameter, and allow for the required video assessment of the alarmed condition.  To accomplish this seamless integration, the contractor must have manufacturers’ certification to install interface equipment necessary to integrate into the Advantor ASN system, which is Air Force Certified for PL1 – PL4.  Equipment mounted within and connected to the ASN Certified monitoring console must be accomplished in full compliance with the Certification provided on the Advantor ASN.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has issued a Solicitation for Letters of Interest (LOIs) to U.S. Small Businesses for the development of prototype photovoltaic (PV) modules and pilot production.  This LOI is in support of U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Solar America Initiative (SAI).  Authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the SAI represents a significant enhancement of DOE's business strategy of partnering with the U.S. industry to accelerate commercialization of photovoltaic (PV) system research and development (R&D) to meet aggressive cost and installed capacity goals.

This Solicitation is targeted at research and development on PV cell and module prototypes with demonstrated functionality in either large-area coupon form or, preferably, prototypes produced in pilot-scale operations.  The emphasis on proposed activities should be on the barriers to manufacturing scale-up and 2010 commercialization.  The primary objective of this program is to shorten the timeline for companies to transition prototype and pre-commercial PV technologies into pilot and full-scale manufacture.

Responders to this solicitation are expected to focus their efforts on a limited number of high impact module technical improvement opportunities that lie on the critical path to scaling up their technology to full manufacture. The minimum entrance criterion is a demonstrated coupon-scale PV cell or process lab devices or modules.  The successful exit criterion is for prototype modules and pilot production demonstration of >3MW/year.  Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that six (6) to ten (10) subcontracts, up to $2M each, will be awarded as 18 month phased subcontracts.

A Net Conference regarding the project is scheduled for Tuesday, April 10,2007, 9:30 A.M. Mountain Time.  The Solicitation is available to view/download from NREL's website at:  http://www.nrel.gov/business_opportunities/solicitations_rfps.html

MCAGCC Access/Security Requirements-Contractor and Contractor-Employee Access Conditions:    1.  Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.  Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below.  Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees.  2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.  Submit the following:   •	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D. •	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof 	of insurance. •	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the 	prime contractor including contract number and term). •	Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year 	covering the previous two years.

The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.   5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.   6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee: 	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List. 	b.    is illegally present in the United States. c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant. d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information. 	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations. 7.

Offerors shall submit past performance and experience information. The offeror must provide the information requested for past performance evaluation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  Relevant contracts include those held within the past three (3) years with civilian and/or Government agencies for similar types of work.  Offeror’s submitting no past performance information will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offeror’s.

Award will be made to the responsible offeror who 1) meets all required technical specifications as determined by an evaluation of documentation submitted with the proposal; and 2) proposes the lowest evaluated price. Information submitted by the offeror must provide a description, to include photographs and/or drawings, in sufficient detail to show that the product offered meets the Government’s requirement and contains all items as described in the statement of work. Submitted information must address each numbered paragraph and subparagraph under Section 3, REQUIREMENTS of the statement of work and affirmatively demonstrate how the offeror’s proposal meets each requirement. Proposal must include a visual representation of the Transpor!  t Container and a schematic showing the arrangement of all kit compone nts within the Transport Container. Technical proposals must not exceed 25 pages. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Initial offers should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. Price Evaluation: Offerors are to propose stepladder pricing as follows: CLIN 0001, 1-40 units $ xx, 41-80 units $ xx, ; 81-120 units $ xx, 121-160 units $ xx, 161-200 units $ xx. For purposes of price evaluation, offerors’ proposed unit prices for each step will multiplied by the maximum number of units in that step. The resulting step evaluated prices will be added together. This sum will be divided by the total of all step maximum quantities to yield the average CLIN unit price. The average CLIN unit price will be multiplied by the maximum quantity to yield the total evaluate!  d CLIN price. Example. Offeror proposal is as follows: CLIN 0001, stepladder 1-40 units $100.00; 41-80 units $95.00; 81-120 units $90.00; 121-160 units $ 85.00; 161-200 units $ 80.00.

Offerors are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible business sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Proposals received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA al!  so allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain i!  ts active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit y our record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA’s homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center San Diego (SSC-SD) intends to procure on a full and open competition basis research and development services to design and prototype Small Antenna Systems (SAS) units for use with GPS receivers. Due to space constraints, current rotary-wing military platforms utilize GPS antenna systems with no inherent jamming resistance. The program objective is to increase the GPS jamming immunity available to these platforms by developing one or more anti-jam antenna system solutions to accommodate the differing installation requirements of the various end- users. The SAS must be backward-compatible with the existing user equipment for the intended platform(s). SSC-SD anticipates issuing multiple completion type contracts in support of this effort. The expected funding is several million dollars for a multi-year program that is intended to develop production representative units. A survey of the industry response to an SAS RFI in Aug 2006 suggests that the most favorable end-to-end solutions may not reside with a single vendor. Therefore, company teaming is encouraged to exploit the promising antenna or signal processing technologies of separate firms in common system-level solutions. Access to portions of the solicitation resulting from this announcement shall require a facility clearance of secret.  Interested parties lacking a secret facility clearance will not have access to all specifications under this project. Therefore, SSC-SD requests that potential offerors submit the following information to the SSC-SD contracts negotiator: Company Name; Address of business unit proposed; company cage code.  This information will be used to verify that interested parties are permitted access to all specifications prior to solicitation issuance.  The Contracting Officer has determined the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number for this procurement to be 541710.  An Industry Day is scheduled for 08-09 May 2007. The Industry Day agenda and visit request information are posted on the SPAWAR E- Commerce Central (E-CC)website https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil/. Permission to attend Industry Day is contingent upon prior government approval and notification thereof to potential attendees. Companies planning to attend Industry Day are requested to do the following: No later than 2 weeks after the date of this announcement, provide response affirming Industry Day attendance to Ms. Oralee Martin, SSC-SD contracts negotiator, e-mail address: oralee.martin@navy.mil ; phone: 619-553-5347. No later than 2 weeks after the date of this announcement, provide notification to Ms. Martin, SSC-SD of your firms intent to conduct a presentation of your firms products and capabilities to other industry participants on 08 May 2007 per the schedule described in the Industry Day agenda . The presentation is to be at a level appropriate for public release. Participation is on a voluntary basis and will have no bearing on a future contract award. No later than 2 weeks after the date of this announcement, provide notification to Ms. Martin, SSC-SD of your firms intent to participate in a one-on-one discussion session with the government on 09 May 2007 per the schedule described in the Industry Day agenda.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) has a requirement to purchase the services of Algotex Inc, New York and Dr. Tsao to consult and assist in evaluating the progress of seedling, or proof of principle project in Mechanisms of Behavior Change on Alcohol Abuse disorders. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) is the lead Federal agency responsible for research on the causes, consequences, prevention, and treatment of alcohol-related problems.  The Institute funds more than 90 percent of alcohol-related research in the U.S. As such, NIAAA-supported research aims to be cutting-edge and multi-disciplinary in scope, capitalizing on the best science from a range of disciplines to enhance research and increase the momentum of discoveries to benefit individual and public health.  The purpose of this contract is to provide technical and scientific advice to NIAAA in order to promote and advance the Mechanisms of Behavior Change Interdisciplinary Imitative.  Dr. Tsao will assist in guiding the Mechanisms of Behavior Change Interdisciplinary Research Consortium (MIRC).  The purpose of the Mechanisms of Behavior Change Interdisciplinary Research Consortium (MIRC) initiative is to promote high-risk, high-yield scientific study and experiments directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or solution.  The goal is to enable the Institute to administer a 24-month proof of principle project in the area of Mechanisms of Behavior Change as related to alcohol abuse and related behaviors.  In FY 2002, Dr. Anna Tsao, a special expert consultant to the Director, NIAAA, was retained, in part, to advise on the development of a revolutionary research initiative on the mechanisms of behavior change in alcohol use disorders.  Although such a project is judged to be high-risk, it is hoped that success would enable more effective, science-based interventions to be developed.  Dr. Tsao is uniquely suited for providing this advice and counsel because of her previous experience as a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program manager. Dr. Tsao’s professional standing and experience to attract and integrate world-class researchers normally outside the field of alcohol research, but with potentially valuable insights into the field, to collaborate with alcohol researchers.  Furthermore, she has excellent relations with a number of Federal agencies, such as NSF, DOD, DOE and DARPA that will maximize co-funding opportunities for the Institute.  Dr. Tsao has unique familiarity with the current project because of her recent experiences in providing consultation the NIAAA Director on its formulation and development.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This is set aside for small businesses.  Responsible vendors that are capable of providing NIDDK with this service may request a copy of the RFQ in writing or by FAX to 301-480-8501 to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice.  The solicitation will be issued on or about April 22, 2007 and offers will be tentatively due about 15 days after the solicitation release date.  The acquisition will be conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The acquisition will be set-aside for small businesses.  Potential offerors may request a copy of the solicitation from V. Lynn Griffin at 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Room 774B, Bethesda, MD 20892 or by fax on (301) 480-8501.  Please reference the solicitation number, RFQ-NIH-NIDDK-07-208 on your written request.

<DESC>****IMPORTANT INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT GLENDA MORGAN FOR TECHNICAL QUESTION OR ANY INFORMATION CONCERNING THIS SOLICITATION**** NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Research and analysis to increase speed of a backscatter x-ray.	 NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from the University of Florida on a Sole Source Basis.	NASA has acquired 6 backscatter x-ray inspection systems from the University of Florida over the past 3 years. In order to provide the best value to the government, the proposed research should lead to an upgrade of the existing systems rather than require the purchase of new systems from a different vendor. Because the University of Florida provided the current systems, they are uniquely qualified to perform research leading to an upgrade of those systems since all the drawings, schematics, part numbers and other proprietary details are available to them. They also have extensive experience working with these systems so they are already familiar with the limitations and have a good idea where to direct research to yield the greatest improvement in speed. Another vendor would not be able to provide the same quality of work because they would have to spend a great deal of effort understanding how NASA’s backscatter x-ray systems function.  There would also be proprietary aspects of the design. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 8, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Please send responses to Glenda Morgan at glenda.morgan@msfc.nasa.gov or fax information to (256) 544-4401 To The attention of Glenda Morgan. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Joint Terminal Controller Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) project under the Tactical Airborne Control System funds developments  necessary to provide Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable  high-fidelity Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), and Combat Control  Team (CCT) training and rehearsal system. The JTC TRS will be able to  connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity  close air support platforms and JTACs/CCT teams to train together. The JTC  TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS)  training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are  relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of  providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application  of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS  shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full  mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air  Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests  and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow  JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary  focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training  environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal  capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air  crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to  ground forces. JTC TRS will be fully interoperable with joint/sister  Service air ground simulation using industry standards.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

NO RECONDITIONED ITEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP printers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the HP 1200d Printer as a key component to produce emergency photo-digitized passports at overseas Posts.  The HP1200d was selected for this purpose because results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. in tests of commercial, non-custom ink jet printers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s requirements.   The 1200d uses some color in producing a grayscale printout.  Other manufacturers’ printers solely use black ink for this printing option.  The introduction of color in the generation of grayscale images significantly improves their quality and enhances overall document security since illicit duplication and image substitution is more difficult.  In addition, other manufacturers were found to use an ink formula that appeared to degrade output resolution and print quality, thereby lessening the security of these travel documents.  Lastly, a key issue in choosing the HP1200d was its proven ability to reliably feed the special stock used in the generation of emergency passport books.  Other printers experienced a higher rate of paper jams and stock spoilage because they were unable to handle paper of the weight and substrate finish used by the DoS. It should be noted that the only other printer that was judged to meet the Department’s specifications was the Ricoh G700, which cannot be procured or fielded because it is not BAA/TAA compliant.  In summation, the continued use of the HP 1200d printer, rather than the introduction of another manufacturer’s product at this stage in the program’s life cycle, is deemed to be the most cost effective course of action.  No other BAA/TAA compliant printer fully meets the Department’s requirements.  The continued use of one make and model printer, the 1200D, eliminates the need to purchase, maintain and account for inventories of spare parts, cables, cleaning kits, ink cartridges and other accessories for multiple printer types.  Moreover, the selection of the 1200d obviates the need to train end users in the use and maintenance of multiple printers As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The HP 1200D Printer has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board<BR><BR>

<DESC>INTEGRATED HIGH ENERGY DENSE CAPACITORS (IHEDC)
BAA 07-21, Addendum 3
Full Proposals Due: 4:00PM ET, May 16, 2007
TECHNICAL POC: Sharon Beermann-Curtin, DARPA/DSO 
Ph: (571) 218-4935; Email: BAA07-21@darpa.mil
URL: www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm
Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dsobaa/

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE

(Note: This BAA Addendum 3 is submitted as a Special Focus Area as described in the original BAA, 07-21.)
 
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) seeks proposals for innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in materials science and processes resulting in long life, high energy dense and high temperature capacitors for high power electrical systems. It is envisioned that new materials incorporating high permittivity together with high electric field strengths as well as innovative processing and packaging techniques will bring revolutionary operational capabilities. The IHEDC program is interested in developing new environmentally safe materials to reduce the weight and volume of high power capacitors along with novel packaging techniques that will maintain the material gains. The ultimate goal of the IHEDC program will be to provide reliable, compact capacitors tightly integrated with active power electronic components to enable prognostics, adaptability, and therefore ‘smart’ capacitors. The ability to integrate active and passive power electronic components will open the design space for high power electrical systems.  

The program is structured into two phases - Phase I and Phase II - with specific technical goals for each phase as noted herein. Satisfactory attainment of the goals for Phase I will be a determining factor in the decision to proceed to Phase II.

BACKGROUND

The military’s direction for the future is towards more electrical weapons and platforms. To meet these high power demands requires improved passive electrical components keeping pace with technical improvements in the state-of-the-art active power electronics. Improved energy storage devices for high power electronic systems are critical to the successful implementation of pulse power as well as power conditioning applications for envisioned platforms. Current electrical system size and weight is driven by the passive components rather than the active components. This is especially true in pulse power applications, where the capacitor comprises fifty percent of the system volume.  

Existing capacitors cannot meet the future platform size and weight constraints while simultaneously providing higher energy storage capability. New materials are required to both reduce the size and weight of current capacitors and to meet or exceed the stringent temperature, stress and multi-functional requirements for the next generation of military high power electrical systems. Additionally, the developed capacitor must utilize materials that are environmentally friendly, have quick discharge rates and sustain a charge for enhanced periods of time. These materials must be packaged using unique solutions that allow for an integrated power system with improved functionality and operability in confined spaces.

PROGRAM GOALS AND MILESTONES 
 
Phase I Metrics: 
Develop materials and processes required to produce capacitors with metrics as specified below. The dielectric material with a permittivity to meet the metrics must be capable of being manufactured in sufficient quantities to provide 20 single cell capacitors at the end of Phase I. The proposer must show a path forward to reliably produce the dielectric materials with properties and attributes that lend themselves to manufacturability of large areas (sheets or otherwise). It is critical that the proposer have access to a facility to produce the required 20 capacitors or team with partners that are capable of manufacturing the deliverable capacitors. Critical metrics include: high temperature, high energy density, long life, environmentally friendly materials, and quick discharge rates.    

Phase I Packaged Metrics:
Energy (J): greater than 100
Energy Density (J/cc): greater than 20
Dielectric Loss (at 1 kHz): less than 0.001
Discharge Time (usec): less than 10
Voltage (kV) at operating temperature: greater than 1
Charge/Hold (hour): greater than 0.5 
Lifetime (at full rating): greater than 1000 cycles
High Temperature Operation (degree C): greater than 200

Phase I Deliverables:
20 Fully Packaged Single Cell Capacitors

Phase II Metrics:
Provide further innovations on Phase I deliverables to enable scaling, higher reliability and increased operating parameters. Develop a ‘smart’ capacitor through integration of active electronics into the capacitor. Examples include the ability to provide internal prognosis (temperature, capacitance, etc.) and identification of external faults allowing re-routing to nearby capacitors. The envisioned ‘smart’ capacitor will open up the design space for modularity, adaptability, and recoverability in the passive components with capability of today’s active components. The design should utilize the capacitor as a building block, thus eliminating over-designed power electronic structures and interconnects, alleviating the use of additional thermal management.  

Phase II Packaged Metrics:
Energy (J): greater than 400
Energy Density (J/cc): greater than 20
Dielectric Loss (at 1 kHz): less than 0.001
Discharge Time (usec): less than 10
Voltage (kV) at operating temperature: greater than 1
Charge/Hold (hour): greater than 1
Lifetime (at full rating): 10000 cycles
High Temperature Operation (degree C): greater than 200
Integration of Active Power Electronics into Capacitors

Phase II Deliverables:
20 Fully Packaged and Integrated Capacitors

PROPOSAL PROCESS

Proposal Submission and Deadlines
Proposals may be submitted and received at any time until the final proposal deadline of 4:00PM ET, Wednesday, May 16, 2007. Proposals will be evaluated against the criteria set forth in BAA 07-21, and the proposer will be notified either that: (1) the proposal has been selected for funding, or (2) the proposal has not been selected for funding. Proposers may elect to have their proposal withdrawn from consideration at any time during the evaluation process. If a formal request is not made, DARPA will assume that continued evaluation is desired. One copy only of each proposal that is not selected for funding will be retained in DSO files for one year after the signing of the last instrument resulting from this BAA.

The government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. The government also reserves the right to fund proposals in phases with options for continued work at the end of one or more of the phases. Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or "Other Transaction," depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors. The proposer must submit a separate list of all technical data or computer software that will be furnished to the government with other than unlimited rights (see DFARS Part 227).

Full Proposal Submission Guidelines
As described in BAA 07-21, full proposals shall consist of two volumes: Technical and Cost. Follow the general guidelines for full proposal format and content provided at: http://www.darpa.mil/baa/BAA07-21pt2.html. 

The technical section of the full proposal must include:

1) 		Description of the vision to integrate active components within a high energy dense capacitor including a description of the envisioned enabling capabilities that will be provided at the system level.
2) 		Concise explanation of approach to develop the dielectric material being proposed. If more than one material is proposed, include a metrics-based explanation of how the material downselect will be made. Material parameters should include the morphology that needs to be achieved and a chart of material expected attributes (e.g., permittivity, voltage breakdown, temperature, etc.).
3) 		Description of approach to achieve metallization of electrodes and numerical prediction of the expected capacitor properties due to the packaging that will be employed to achieve required energy densities.
4) 		A detailed research plan with calculations including experimental measurement procedures for dielectrics and packaged capacitor.
5) 		Detailed explanation of the electrode and packaging processes to achieve energy densities and active electronics integrations at required temperatures.
6) 		A quad chart that outlines the vision, approach, and enabling military capabilities of the effort.
7) 		Quantified technical and schedule milestones and deliverables for Phase I and for Phase II.

OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION

<DESC>This note replaces a notice that was erroneously deleted on FedBizOpps and which advises that Amendment 0002 has been posted in the Business Opportunities section of the following NAVAIR TSD website: 

http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm?client=NAWCTSD

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training System Division (NAWCTSD) has a requirement to support the Navy?s Command Aircraft Crew Training (CACT) program which includes providing all labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training materials, training devices, supervision and other services necessary for classroom, trainer, and simulator training for Navy C-40A (Boeing 737-700C with increased gross weight (IGW) as configured for U.S. Navy) aircrew.  

The C-40A CACT program requires classroom (academic and practical) training, a Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT) that depicts all cockpit systems, a Part Task Trainer (PTT) (for aircraft system training with trainee input and trainer response capability), and a FAA level "C" or higher simulator.  In lieu of the CFT or PTT a higher order device may be used.  The flight simulator must be FAA certified to Level "C" or higher under current FAA Advisory Circular 120-40 criteria for the Boeing 737-700/800 configured cockpit with freeze and repositioning capability.  The following individual pilot/crew chief training courses are required:  C-40A Pilot Initial Training and C-40A Pilot and Crew Chief Recurrent Training.  The training courses must be presented at a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 142 certified training center for the Boeing 737-700 IGW aircraft at time of training.  Instructors must be certified under Title 14 CFR Part 142.  The contractor will be required to submit training syllabus for each course for government approval.

For all courses, the contractor shall provide: All the necessary facilities, certified instructors, management personnel, scheduling/administrative personnel; materials; rights for use of materials for this contracted training, training devices, simulators; and courseware/materials needed for each course.  Pilot Initial course attendees will be designated Military Aviators.  Pilot Recurrent course attendees will be qualified Military C-40 Pilot-in-Command or Second Pilot Military Aviators that will have normally completed the C-40 Pilot Initial Course.  Pilot Recurrent training will be broken into 3 distinct tracks identified as follows:  1.) Pilot 1 Recurrent Training will be a Copilot refresher-training course; 2.) Pilot 2 Recurrent Training will be an Aircraft Commander Upgrade training course; 3.) Pilot 3 Recurrent Training will be a currently qualified Aircraft Commander recurrent training course.  Courses are stand-alone in that no contractor, pre-arrival training requirements of the trainee will be allowed.  Courses may be existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) training courses modified to meet specific requirements delineated herein.  All training courses shall be taught in compliance with the C-40 Model Manager Approved Training Syllabi.  The contractor will be required to submit a training syllabus for each course for government approval.  C-40 training will not result in a FAA check flight or certification.

In accordance with FAR10.001, the government is conducting market research to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes. This is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. 

The Government will use the information gathered in response to this document to refine acquisition strategy for integrated service solutions. 

The government has approximately 120 Nexiant point-of-use industrial plant equipment in place today and is planning to have an estimated number of 400 when installation is complete. The equipment will be located in 40+ buildings. 

The MRO materials to be stocked include but are not limited to consumables, expendables and personal protection equipment items at each location.  The Government plans to have one provider for all locations and applications. The services to be provide include (1) Manage Nexiant point-of-use applications (equipment) at specified buildings and locations; (2) Purchase, Deliver, Stock and Replenish all MRO materials and inventory within point-of-use applications, (equipment); (3) Maintain, Cycle Count and Manage all inventory with point-of-use applications (equipment) and virtual cribs. 4) Process, expedite, and follow-up on spot buys and purchases, and; (5) Provide inventory and category management services.  For informational purposes only the Government is requesting answers to the following questions:

1. Does your company perform Inventory Management as described above for commercial Industry? Please provide a brief description of the scope of that effort. Can you provide copies of these contracts or Point of Contacts to obtain additional information?

2. Do you provide this or a similar service to a government entity? Which government entity and what are the contract numbers or Point of Contacts?

3. What type of a contract (Firm fixed price, Cost plus fixed fee, Time and Materials etc) would provide the Government the best service and work best for your company to supply this integrated service? Do you have any that are gain or profit/cost reduction

4. If we have a requirement for one-time spot buys for existing Industrial Production Equipment do you have experience with performing this type of service or buy? What type of CLIN structure would you use for this type of requirement?

5. Have you been involved with or used an automated point-of-use system? If yes, please describe the extent and details of that experience. Please list the types of equipment and the manufacturer that you’ve used.

6. It is unclear what the full scope of an Inventory Product Service requirement will look like at 76MXW over the next year. However, the Government has a partial perspective of what is currently in place. How would you plan for fluctuations in the requirement workload (with only partial history)for a procurement of this nature?

7.  How would you propose to add items and locations as they grow?

Suppliers/Offerors who provide verification of their security clearance may request a copy of the classified and unclassified list of spares, a draft SOW will be available at your request. This effort also includes providing Fielding and NET training to an average of three brigade combat teams (BCTs) per month. The duration of NET training (Operator/Maintenance and Repair) will be 4 weeks and consist of 3-6 man teams both CONUS, OCONUS and in OIF  and OEF. Trainers will be required to have current TS/SCI clearance with Annex P approvals from NSA. In addition this effort will include Depot Level Support to include maintenance and repair of the Prophet Systems. The Prophet Block III Spiral 1 Sensor/C ontrol System will provide the Army with an enhanced SIGINT capability, which provides force protection information in a direct support role; either stationary, or at-the-short-halt and on-the-move concept of operation. The system has the capability to det ect, monitor, identify and selectively exploit Radio Frequency (RF) signals. The exploited signal data can be relayed via voice or data through the communications transceivers. The system has a networking capability with other similar assets to coordinate target information. The Prophet Sensor is mounted on a M1165A1 B(3) High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) that tows a M1102 Light Tactical Trailer-Heavy (LTT-H).

L-3 Communications Titan Corporation, Linkabit Division, 3033 Science Park Road, San Diego, CA is currently under the C-E LCMC, DAAB07-01-C-L539 contract to produce these systems. The Prophet System is a low density system, so it was determined by the G overnment that it would not be cost effective to procure a complete technical package. Therefore, not all detailed technical data for the manufacture/repair or acceptance of these items is available from the Government. Potential sources are requested to s ubmit a statement of their interest along with a description of their proposed approach and experience in providing the type of service requested by this market survey within 15 days from the posting date of this notice.

<DESC>Description The Government intends to increase the current contract ceiling and extend the period of performance on a sole source basis of its current contract with Raytheon, Netcentric Div, Fort Wayne, Indiana for contract DAAB07-99-C-E003. This contract is for the d evelopment and maintenance of the Advanced Field Artillery Technical Data System (AFATDS) and supporting software programs.  The contractor must possess product specific expertise, domain experience, and demonstrate the ability to accomplish the specific t asks (below) within the time constraints required to successfully accomplish the specified tasks.   The proposed effort is for the AFATDS Block 3/3+, which is intended to support the Army rotations scheduled for the 2010-2011 timeframe in the form of multi ple AFATDS software baselines.  Period of performance for this effort is May 2007 through May 2011. Interested contractors should submit information concerning their qualifications and ability to complete the required work to either Ms. Cynthia Inteso (cyn thia.inteso@mail1.monmouth.army.mil) or Mr. Andrew Liang (andrew.liang@mail1.monmouth.army.mil).   The AFATDS is a multi-service (USA/USMC/USN), automated Command and Control and Communications system that provides automated fire support and coordination t o all the services.  AFATDS pairs weapons to targets providing maximum effective use of all available fire support assets.  AFATDS automates the planning, coordinating, and controlling of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support , naval gunfire, attack helicopters and offensive electronic warfare).  AFATDS will perform the fire support command, control and coordination requirements at all echelons of field artillery and maneuver, from Echelons above Corps to Battery or Platoon in support of all levels of conflict.  AFATDS passed its Milestone III Production Decision in 1995 and continues to incrementally release software upgrades and field the system to the Army, Marine Corps, and Navy.  AFATDS is composed of Common Hardware/Softwa re employed in varying configurations at different operational facilities or nodes and unique system software interconnected by tactical communications in the form of software driven, automated network.    System Description / Status  AFATDS is the fires component of the Battle Command (BC) System Of Systems (SoS) and is comprised of a UNIX based server and multiple Windows based clients.   Each version of AFATDS is built off its preceding version baseline.  Version developments overla p by twelve to eighteen months depending upon size of the capability being added.  The AFATDS totals 2.8 million source lines of code that is a mix of approximately 93% Ada, 5% Java and the remaining in C and C++.   The AFATDS server encompasses seventeen computer software configuration items (CSCI) and is hosted on the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) Common Operating Environment (COE).   AFATDS adheres to thirty-six different processing standards, twenty different human-computer interface standard s and  more than fifty different data transport standards; AFATDS interoperates with more than seventy other Army, Joint and Coalition systems.  AFATDS operates at SECRET classification level and requires compliance with the DOD Information Assurance Certi fication and Accreditation Program (DIACAP).  The Effects Management Tool (EMT) is employed as a client terminal of the AFATDS and operated via Ethernet or Combat Net Radio (CNR) connection.  The EMT is a Java-based client that allows user access to select ed AFATDS database information including geometries, unit data and mission data through AFATDS external Application Program Interfaces (API) or through CNR depending on the operational mode.   The SISTIM is a message stimulation and simulation product that  supports testing and training for fire support systems.  It is capable of transmitting and receiving fire support messages using communications protocols, an d performing simple messages response generation for several common fire support systems.  SISTIM also includes a Time-Ordered-Event-List (TOEL) generation and execution capability, providing the operator with a means of creating and playing back a seque nce of actions to the live fire support systems.  In the task descriptions below, use of the term AFATDS will be defined to include all work associated with the main AFATDS baseline, the EMT, the SISTIM and all other component configuration items. Task 1: There are currently four versions of AFATDS in varying stages; AFATDS 6.4.0.0, AFATDS 6.4.0.1, AFATDS 6.5 and AFATDS 6.6. AFATDS 6.4 is completed and is being fielded to the Army, USMC and Navy in support of Army Software Block 1.   AFATDS 6.4.0.1 has been developed to support an urgent need in theater for the Excalibur munition and is in the final phase of testing prior to being released for distribution.   The AFATDS 6.4.0.1 adds the command and control (C2) in support of Excalibur and adds the up graded MIL-STD 6017 variable message format (VMF) interface to support the LW155 howitzer.  AFATDS 6.5 is in the final stages of development and will enter the Intra Army Interoperability Certification (IAIC) in April 2007.  AFATDS 6.5 adds the full comple ment of MIL-STD 6017 VMF message set; upgrades to the Artillery Systems Coordination Agreement (ASCA) interface to coalition systems; mechanisms for fratricide avoidance; C2 upgrades for existing munitions and support of the Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) and the Common Grid Reference System (CGRS).  AFATDS 6.6 adds Enhanced Immediate Air Processing; the MIL-STD 6017A VMF upgrade; migration to the Battle Command Net Centric architecture; and C2 and fires support coordination for the USMC Expeditionar y Fire Support System (EFSS) Rifled Towed Mortar and the new Army precision munitions, Non-Line of Sight-Launcher System (NLOS-LS) Precision Attack Missile (PAM), multiple variants of the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), and the Multi Launch Rocket S ystem (MLRS) Guided Unitary Rocket.  Also added to AFATDS 6.6 is the Windows XP operating system as a supported platform with plans to migrate to the Vista OS later this year.  Both MS-Windows and Solaris will be supported by the AFATDS 6.6 baseline. The t ask that will have to be accomplished by either the existing contractor or another source established via the market survey process, is the continued maintenance of the AFATDS 6.5 baseline until such time it is completely fielded to all Army and USMC units  and maintenance of the AFATDS 6.6 baseline through any final test/fix activities until such time it is completely fielded to all Army and USMC units.  The contractor tasked to accomplish this effort must possess detailed knowledge of the code and the oper ational architecture/environment in order to sustain it through security and safety certifications (and associated updates).   The contractor tasked to accomplish this effort also must possess a thorough working knowledge of the system in order to provide the requisite test and training expertise through the final stages of pre-fielding activities.  Task 2: AFATDS 6.7 and AFATDS 6.8 are the next two successive baselines planned to support the Army Rotation scheduled to begin in 2010 and 2011 respectively. These baselines will continue with developmental schedules that overlap their predecessor baselines by 12-18 months.  AFATDS will continue to have a new baseline fielded with every yearly Army rotation into theater.  The contractor must possess a thorough knowledge of the AFATDS system and software architecture and code and possess the in-depth subject matter expertise to incorporate the following into the AFATDS 6.7 baseline: Height Above Ellipsoid, USMCs Ground Counter Fire Radar System, Close Air Suppor t Mission Processing, Joint targeting in coordination with USAF, USN and Intel community, Precision Guidance Kit and the Advanced Cannon Artillery Ammunition Program ( ACA2P), updates to the MIL-STD 6017A VMF, Battle Command upgrades, Air Battle and Airspace Management, and precision munitions upgrades.  In addition to the above, the contractor must possess expertise in web-enabled technology to support the transition of  the AFATDS capabilities into a service-based architecture under the Net Enabled Command Capability (NECC) and Battle Command Architectures.  The contractor will be required to redesign AFATDS capabilities into independent services that will reside on the Global Information Grid (GIG), while also retaining legacy architecture in support of echelons at Brigade and below.  The contractor will be required to incorporate into AFATDS 6.8 a networked on-the-move Battle Command that employs net-centric fires; comm ander and staff collaborative planning and war gaming, the ability to plan, coordinate and conduct precision fires in Joint Urban Operations; and upgraded communications with Allied Coalition Force C3 Digital Systems.   The contractor must also possess a t horough knowledge of the Joint Automated Deep Operations Coordination System (JADOCS) system, software and operational architecture to accomplish the merger of JADOCS and EMT into a single Fires Client to AFATDS.  In addition to the expertise needed to dev elop the above capabilities, the contractor must be able to support all technical, operational, safety, interoperability and security testing, be able to provide the requisite training support to the training team and provide field engineering support to t he units in theater.   Please submit all responses, to include a detailed description of contractor qualifications no later than 29 March 2007.   Responses should not exceed five (5) pages.

<DESC>HQ ACC AMIC/PKA Newport News VA intends to award a non-competitive, sole source purchase order with TVI Corp for the purchase of Fourteen (14) 3-Line In-Place Patient Decontamination (IPPD) systems, Part Number SYS-SD4-0016 to replace the existing aging and unserviceable IPPD systems for Active Duty OCONUS bases. This requirement is a follow on to a previous acquisition for these items.


The acquisition of these units is significant in maintaining compatibility, long term continuity and sustained on time maintenance with the current in place inventory. No other contractor, to the best of our knowledge, can provide the above items contained within IPPD systems with the necessary quality, durability, and operational functionality required by the Homeland Defense Mission.


This procurement is authorized in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1). The proposed solicitation is for commodities for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR6.302-1. Previous acquisition history for these items was conducted under FA4890-06-F-0088. That purchase was for 60, 3-Line In-Place Patient Decontamination (IPPD) systems to be delivered to various Air Force CONUS installations.


Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals via e-mail to ronald.toler@langley.af.mil. Telephone requests will not be honored. A determination by the government to compete this proposed action based on the responses to this notice will be based solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice.  The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting market research to locate sources interested in performing an upgrade of the jet engine test cell located at the Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC) in Elizabeth City, North Carolina.  The test cell is used to perform out-of-airframe testing for the Honeywell ATF3-6-4C engine.  ARSC test cell technicians are experiencing difficulties with data acquisition and reduction during engine performance runs.  The existing program installed in the U.S. Coast Guard ATF3-6-4C test cell cannot be supported in its current state due to obsolete computer technology.  The current Data Reduction system, installed at the U.S. Coast Guard facility at AR&SC, relies on the Data General computer to acquire the test data.  Then a system of programs, written by Honeywell International, interfaces with the Data General to download the test data and convert it to the Honeywell standard test file. This standard test file is stored on the PC, and can then be used as input to the ATF3 data reduction program. Results from this data reduction are then used to provide input to a Trending module.  The Trending module, part of the data reduction/diagnostic package, uses old DBase3 software, and maintains a database of engines tested for historical trending purposes. The DBase3 software cannot be made compatible with the new operating systems. A new Trending module would have to be created using modern database software.  The Interface software, used between the data reduction program and the Data General mainframe, will require modification to be compatible with the new PC operating systems. 

The U.S. Coast Guard uses the wet bulb-dry bulb method of determining humidity. This method cannot be used during the winter months due to freezing conditions.  Year round humidity correction is required, so the U.S. Coast Guard desires to obtain equipment that directly measures relative humidity or dew point and feeds this information directly to the data acquisition system. 

A date and time for a Pre-Proposal Site Visit will be established prior to the issuance of a formal solicitation.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice.  The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting market research  to locate sources capable of and interested in upgrading an engine test cell at the Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC) in Elizabeth City, North Carolina.   The United States Coast Guard (USCG) operates a test cell for testing General Electric T700-GE-401C engines repaired at the USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC).  This test system is an indoor test cell that utilizes the trailer mounted A/F 37T-16V turboshaft engine test system mated to an air dynamometer PN 1314AS100-1.  The system is controlled and monitored by an Automatic Data Acquisition System (ADAS) designed by, and proprietary to, CMR Technologies Inc.  This includes the hardware, interface, and software package.  The USCG does not own, nor can it provide, the technical information for this ADAS system.  The ADAS system currently in use is unique to the USCG ARSC test cell, and is currently experiencing supportability issues due to computer technology obsolescence.

The USCG desires to upgrade or replace the current ADAS system with a system of modern design that utilizes as many Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components as possible.  The system should be capable of running the T700-GE-401 series of engines with the 24 pin Digital Engine Control (DEC) or the 31 pin DEC.  The system should be similar in construction and operation to other T700-GE-401 series engine test cells in use at commercial and Government facilities.

A date and time for a Pre-Proposal Site Visit will be established prior to the issuance of a formal solicitation.

<SUBJECT>69--Delivery and installation of Pneumatic Multi-use, Multi-purpose Target Systems at Various Marine Corps Ranges
<SOLNBR>M6785407R8085
<RESPDATE>041107
<CONTACT>John E. Lynch john.e.lynch2@usmc.mil
<DESC>NAICS Code: 335999: The government is seeking sources to deliver and install pneumatic multi-purpose, multi-use target systems at several Marine Corps Installations.  The target systems will be somewhat similar but will have specific differences at each location as set forth below.   In general, pneumatic operating systems to power the ranges are preferred.  The targets must be placed 5-6 feet on center and be capable of turning 90 degrees to repeatedly face and face away from the shooter.  The target holders must be designed to hold a standard military “E-type” silhouette (20” x  40”) without modification and be designed using material that will not allow ricochets.  Concrete firing lines would be installed at the 25, 15 and 7 yard lines.  All firing lines must be installed at precise distances.  Computer control systems are required and must include a removable control box and must include a “Toughbook” type laptop computer (Mil Std 810F compliant) for automatic operation.  The computer must be fully installed with programmable, “Windows-type” software to operate the targetry according to standard Marine Corps marksmanship standards.  The system must be programmable to allow facing of any and/or all targets simultaneously.  The operating system must in!  clude an air compressor with dryer package to include: a pressure gauge, regulator, filter, an air-cooled after-cooler, and a desiccant dryer assembly.  A shelter must be provided to protect the compressor and its components from the elements.  Where ever possible, normal 110 volt (house) power is desired to run the compressor. At Puuloa, MCB Hawaii, E and F ranges are adjacent and identically configured.  The existing target arrays are set 25 yards from the existing firing line and thus 25 to 30 yards in front of the impact berm.  This allows any round that is not fired from the standing or off-hand position to go high, miss the impact berm and impact far into the Pacific Ocean immediately behind the berm.  The contractor would be required to remove the existing target system along with the current protective berm.  Dirt from the existing protective berms could be added to the existing impact berm.  Concrete, blocks and stone must be removed from the range.  The contractor would then install the target array on a line 50 yards from the existing firing line.  After removal of the existing target system and berm, the contractor would install a bank of twenty-five (25) turning targets on each range to be placed in a position 50 yards forward of the existing firing line.  Existing target mechanisms mu!  st be re-used where ever possible.   The installation must include installation of a protective barrier in front of the targets to protect the target mechanism and a small structure to protect the compressor from inclement weather.  Ricochet producing target mechanisms must be below the protective barrier in all cases.  The ranges have adequate impact barriers behind the targets.  C Range at Puuloa currently has no target system and has been operated using temporary target arrays.  The range has an existing, adequate impact berm and protective side berms to separate it from adjacent ranges.  The range is approximately 50 yards deep, is graded appropriately and has no established firing lines.  The range is used for a variety of small arms to include pistols of all calibers, shotgun slugs and buckshot and rifles up to 5.56 mm.   The contractor would install a bank of forty (40) turning targets to be placed in a position 50 yards forward of the firing line.  A new concrete firing line approximately 8-10 feet wide would be installed at the 50 yard line.  Benches and tables are not required or desired on the firing line.    The targets must be placed 4-5 feet on center and be capable of turning 90 degrees to repeatedly face and face away from the shooter.   At Stone Bay, MCB Camp Lejeune NC, two 50 target pistol ranges require replacement target systems.  On the range known as the Mechanical Pistol Range, the existing target system is comprised of a 1950’s vintage bank of targets that move on rails by means of an electric motor.  The targets can be moved to the 7, 15 and 25 yard lines to accomplish qualification, re-qualification and competition pistol shooting.  The target carriage can also be moved to the 50 yard line for competition pistol matches.  The existing target system has fallen into severe disrepair and is currently inoperable.  The first part of this contract would require disassembly, removal and disposal of the existing target system and associated rails.  After removal of the existing target system, the contractor would install a bank of fifty (50) turning targets to be placed in a position 25 yards forward of the existing firing line.  New concrete firing lines would be installed at the 15 and 7 yard lines.  A !  bank of 50 stationary, non-turning but removable targets will be installed at the 50 yard line.  The installation must include installation of a protective barrier in front of the 25 yard line targets to protect the target mechanisms.  Ricochet producing target mechanisms must be below the protective barrier in all cases.  The range has adequate impact barriers or bullet traps behind the targets.   At the second Stone Bay pistol range, the contractor would install two banks of fifty turning targets to be placed at 25 and 50 yards from the existing firing line.  All target lines must be installed at precise distances to permit competition to NRA and national standards.  A single pneumatic operating system to power both target banks is preferred.  The range currently has adequate impact barriers behind the targets.  Contract will involve removal of the existing target system. At Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, NC, the target system must contain 10-12 firing positions.  Temporary targets have been used on this range previously with weapons including small arms up to 5.56mm rifle, .45 caliber pistol and 12 gauge shotgun.  The targets would consist of a combination of stationary paper and steel targets in a variety of formats and moving targets at a ratio of 1:6 turning targets.  The variety of stationary targets would include a bank of programmable turning silhouette targets, several sets of eight-inch knock-down steel head plates that can be remotely re-set, several 12” x 18” removable steel chest plates.  The moving target would be capable of carrying cardboard or steel silhouettes over a distance of at least 20 feet and be programmable to move at speeds up to that of a man running.  All steel targets must be of Brinell 500 hardness.  The target system must be free standing, modular in design and must be able to be removed and re-installed!   if necessary.  The target mechanisms are to be protected by an angled steel deflector plate of Brinell 500 hardness to preclude the need for a permanent protective front berm.  The range has an adequate impact berm already in place.  This range will not include any concrete firing lines.   At MCB Camp Butler, Okinawa 12 target systems are required as an addition to the target system recently installed.  They must include a combination of targets including standard turners, steel head and chest plates and movers. The turning targets must be programmable and able to face 90 degrees simultaneously, individually or in groups.  The system must also have a variety of stationary steel targets would include two sets of eight-inch knock-down steel head plates that can be remotely re-set and at least four 12” x 18” removable steel chest plates.  It must include a moving target capable of carrying cardboard or steel silhouettes over a distance of at least 20 feet at variable speeds up to that of a man running.  All steel targets must be of Brinell 500 hardness.  The target mechanisms are to be protected by an angled steel deflector plate of Brinell 500 hardness to preclude the need for a permanent protective front berm.  Additional targets must be compatible with the con!  trol system and operating system recently installed. At Camp Fuji, MCB Camp Butler, Japan, the requirement exists for a mobile target system for use with small arms up to 5.56mm rifle, .45 caliber pistol and 12 gauge shotgun.  The target system must be self-contained with a generator and compressor on a trailer capable of being pulled by a full sized pickup truck or HMMWV.   Tongue weight must not exceed 300 pounds.  The system must have at least six turning targets with holders that accommodate standard military “E” silhouettes measuring 20 x 40 inches.  The turning targets must be programmable and able to face 90 degrees simultaneously, individually or in groups.  The system must also have a variety of stationary steel targets would include two sets of eight-inch knock-down steel head plates that can be remotely re-set and at least four 12” x 18” removable steel chest plates.  It must include a moving target capable of carrying cardboard or steel silhouettes over a distance of at least 20 feet at variable speeds up to that o!  f a man running.  All steel targets must be of Brinell 500 hardness.  The target mechanisms are to be protected by an angled steel deflector plate of Brinell 500 hardness to preclude the need for a permanent protective front berm.  Removable kevlar-type covers and steel protective plates must be provided to protect the trailer tires from errant rounds and splash.  MCB Camp Pendleton has the requirement for target systems at two separate locations.  The target system at Range 216 must contain 16-20 firing positions and Range 223A can accommodate 22-26 firing positions.  Temporary targets have been used on this range previously with weapons including small arms up to 5.56mm rifle, .45 caliber pistol and 12 gauge shotgun.  The targets would consist of a combination of stationary paper and steel targets in a variety of formats and moving targets at a ratio of 1:6 turning targets.  The variety of stationary targets would include a bank of programmable turning silhouette targets, several sets of eight-inch knock-down steel head plates that can be remotely re-set, several 12” x 18” removable steel chest plates.  The moving target would be capable of carrying cardboard or steel silhouettes over a distance of at least 20 feet and be programmable to move at speeds up to that of a man running.  All steel targets must be of Brinell 500 hardness. !   The target system must be free standing, modular in design and must be able to be removed and re-installed if necessary.  The target mechanisms are to be protected by an angled steel deflector plate of Brinell 500 hardness to preclude the need for a permanent protective front berm.  The ranges have adequate impact berms already in place.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business or HUBZone small businesses capable of providing Tecnai G2 F20 twin – 200kV/FEG Transmission Electron Microscope and maintenance.  The acquisition of this Tecnai G2 F20 Twin microscope from FEI will significantly increase the productivity of the Hinshaw lab and allow large macromolecular complexes to be examined by cryo-electron microscopy at high resolution.  This microscope would allow the lab to solve the structure of numerous proteins using helical, single particle and tomography image processing methods.  The lab would be able to solve the structure of proteins to a resolution of <10 &#506; and to examine organelles, such as the mitochondria, by cryo-tomography.  The 200 kV instrument allows thicker specimens to be examined for cryo-tomography and provides less noise in the images, increasing resolution (Our current microscope is 120 Kv).  The most significant advancement of the TF20 over out CM120 is the Field Emission Gun (FEG).  This provides a greatly improved coherent electron source which significantly increases the resolution.  In addition, the Tecnai series compared to the CM Microscopes are completely digitally controlled, allowing for automation and easier alignment.  Automation is necessary for acquiring tilt series in cryo-tomography and will maximize the use of the scope by recording images without personnel present (i.e., recording overnight).  The 4k x 4k CCD camera is also necessary for cryo-tomography and will eliminate the need for film.  The tecnai interface and CCD camera both are well tailored to network with numerous images processing packages.  The main technical requirements: 1) 200 kV and FEG (Field Emission Gun) transmission Electron Microscope; 2) Scope to be used for low-dose cryo-tomography with Gatan side entry holder; 3) Advanced level of integrated computer control to allow automated data collection of complete tomographic tilt series of specimens.  Specifically the microscope system must be capable of automatically collecting complete tilt series of specified angular increment and angular range with minimum electron dose (“beam shift”) methodology and automatic correction of focus and specimen centering using existing protocols; 4) Specimens must be maintained stably at liquid-nitrogen temperature as well as at room temperature; 5) The microscope must be equipped with a high sensitivity CC camera of 4k x 4k pixel format and allow direct acquisition of digital data; 6) Allow addition of 3rd party hardware (i.e. extra memory and hardware) and software (i.e. Leginon, see 8 below, SerialEM); 7) 80 degree tilt for stage; FEI Technai specific: 8) The program for the automation of the scope apply only to the Tecnai FEI series.  The program is called Leginon and is available from the Scripps Research Institute, National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy; 9) The specimen stage must accept Gatan Model 626 and 914 cryo holders designed for FEI/Phillips transmission microscopes or must provide equivalent functionality at no extra cost as LCBB has already an investment for over $120,000 in this style holder.  The overall floor space requirement for this microscope is 148 x 138 inches and ceiling height is 116.2 inches and the room will have to pass a vibration test.  Interested firms with the capability of providing the required services are requested to submit a capability statement to assist the Government in determining in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) whether or not this procurement will be set-aside for any of the programs described above. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 334519 with a size standard of 500. All respondents are requested to identify their firm’s size and type of business. Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide (a) capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Government’s requirements for the above. The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail, but not to exceed 15 pages, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the requirements above. Your capability statement, not to exceed 15 pages, should include references. Due to time sensitivity, a copy of the capability statement must be received at the address identified in this synopsis by no later than 15 days prior to close of business (5:00 P.M. local time at designated location) on April 10, 2007. Responses by fax or e-mail WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.

<SUBJECT>99--MANUFACTURE AND DESIGN ANTENNA WITH FEEDHORN AND SAIL REFLECTOR
<SOLNBR>RFI-USAFL-OR-2007-01
<RESPDATE>042707
<ARCHDATE>03272008

<DESC>Purpose of Request for Information (RFI):  United Space Alliance (USA), LLC, through its offices located in Cape Canaveral, Florida, is seeking sources capable of providing the requirement described herein.  This acquisition is in support of USA’s prime contract NNJ06VA01C - Space Program Operations Contract (SPOC) with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Technical Requirements Description:  USA is seeking potential sources to manufacture and possibly design an antenna with a feedhorn and sail reflector.	This antenna is one of three antennas used by Navigational Aids system, a Microwave Scanning Beam Landing System (MSBLS or MLS), to land the Space Shuttle Orbiter at Kennedy Space Center, FL and various other locations around the world. Operationally, this antenna sits upon a three-foot tall rotating pedestal, which oscillates back and forth a total angle of 30 degrees in a horizontal plane.  The RF signal normally operates in the super high frequency (SHF) band; specifically, around the 15.6 GHz mark.	The antenna feedhorn provides pulsed directional data, with respect to a common reference point, using a vertically polarized wave to the reflector, which reflects the signal within the 30-degree arc. The reflector portion of the antenna is shaped like a truncated parabola and produces an RF pattern within a vertical plane.  In this vertical plane, the beamwidth is approximately seven degrees at the –3dB points and 15 degrees at the –6 dB points.  The horizontal beamwidth through the beam peak is approximately two degrees at the –3 dB points.  The peak gain for this reflector (and antenna) is 31 dB with the sidelobe levels being at least 20 dB below the peak.   Besides the performance characteristics of the antenna, there are size and weight considerations for this azimuth antenna.  During normal operations, the antenna sits upon a rotating pedestal, but, in addition, a metal shield assembly surrounds the antenna itself.  The metal shield assembly is used to prevent the MSBLS shelter from being flooded with reflected RF energy.  Its approximate size is 39 inches in length, 25 inches in height and 25 inches in depth; so, the size of the antenna must be able to fit within this volume.  In addition to the shield assembly, the torque motor driving the rotation of the antenna’s pedestal is limited in how much it can drive.	To that end, the azimuth antenna need to weigh between 8.9 and 9.7 pounds. After the antenna has been manufactured, testing will be required and will involve both static and dynamic test.  The static testing should be fairly standard and will help to determined antenna gain, VSWR, beam symmetry and etc.  The dynamic test is something a bit unusual, but it is required and is derived from the need to have accuracy in the pulse directional data. The prototype antenna will be installed onto USA’s own antenna test range and the accuracy of the directional data will be determined.  The accuracy of the data is found by comparing the transmitted data to the known positional points where the data is collected.  The manufacture of a prototype azimuth antenna is the bulk portion of the request, but there could be an additional part.  Currently, USA has a set of existing fabrication drawings it can use in the construction of a prototype antenna, but this initial design has a potential deficiency that has been observed in the past.	The actual reflector surface of the reflector has separated from its supporting structure causing anomalous pulsed directional data to be transmitted.  This would be a concern with any antenna constructed from these original drawings; therefore, the idea of a new antenna design that meets all of our requirements would be considered.    A formal Request for Proposal (RFP) may be forthcoming based on the responses to this inquiry.   Procurement Strategy:  USA is responsible for the overall program management and integration of these technical requirements.  USA will solicit the participation of qualified sources and sources desiring to participate on a limited basis will also be considered.  USA reserves the right to issue a sole source subcontract(s).  The period of performance and technical requirements are currently being defined for inclusion into a formal RFP package.  USA anticipates the issuance of a formal RFP within 30 – 60 days of release of this RFI.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes, and the objective is to invite potential sources to submit information that allows USA to conduct a technical assessment of capabilities and qualifications.  This preliminary information does not constitute an RFP, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by USA to enter into a subcontract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications:  USA invites potential sources to submit a Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications document that will allow USA to conduct an assessment of capabilities and qualifications.	The Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications document shall be no more than ten (10) pages (8.5” x 11”) in length.  The required information shall include, but not be limited to:  (1) A brief description of your company, including its size, major products, and primary customer focus, (2) A discussion of your company’s past experience and performance in developing the requirements described herein, and (3) A brief description of your company’s facilities, assets and any other available resources. Past experience will be identified by a listing of all related contracts and subcontracts, along with a description of your company’s performance under these contracts and subcontracts.  If any of these contracts and subcontracts is Government related, provide the Contracting Officer’s name and telephone number in order for USA to validate your statements.  To be considered as a viable source, USA will evaluate the Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications by considering the following criteria and your company must meet all the relevant criteria:  (1) Depth and relevance of experience and past performance history, which convey a demonstrated technical, cost, schedule ability; (2) An understanding of the technical requirements and risks associated with development and fabrication; and (3) The adequacy and availability of necessary facilities and resources for implementing and performing the contractual work. Any company that has experience in antenna design and/or antenna fabrication is encouraged to express their interest in this unique opportunity.  The company should be able to show or demonstrate their expertise in antenna design (if required), antenna fabrication and antenna (static) testing.  The successful candidate company’s expertise will assist not only USA, but NASA as well, in their support of the Space Shuttle Mission until its completion in 2010. USA reserves the right to request supplemental information in order to clarify your company’s capabilities and qualifications.  Only offerors deemed to be best qualified, or have a reasonable chance for award, will receive the RFP.

<DESC>NOAA’s National Marine and Aviation Operation, Office of Ocean Exploration, has a need for the design and installation of a “Tele-presence” System aboard the NOAA Vessel OKEANOS EXPLORER. The purpose of issuing this Sources Sought is to determine the likelihood of obtaining the required need from industry and the feasibility of obtaining the required need from a small business.  

The telepresence system will serve a multitude of purposes (including but not limited to the following): (1) Route video from up to 24 HD/SD/analog cameras (12 shipboard, 12 mounted on two remotely operated vehicles) to displays distributed throughout the ship, a video capture/storage subsystem, a video frame grab subsystem, a multi-view subsystem and a video encoder subsystem; (2) Provide a multi-view subsystem for viewing all of the available camera sources on a single display for use by ROV operators and science personnel; (3) Provide a frame grab subsystem capable of capturing and storing individual video frames from HD, SD and analog video sources for use as still imagery; (4) Stores up to three video feeds (possibly HD quality) for up to 20 days.  The stored video must be tagged with the capture date and time as well as the camera source; (5) Routes KVM, and individual VGA signals from up to 24 computers to 14 user stations and view-only LCD stations, distributed throughout the ship; (6) Provides video encoding/IP encapsulation capable of compressing and packaging multiple live, HD quality video for simultaneous transmission to shore-based destinations via satellite link; (7) Provide an intercom subsystem, capable of communicating not only with ship-based intercom stations but also with shore-based stations over an IP-based network via a satellite link.

Description of Operations: The NOAA Ship OKEANOS EXPLORER will operate in both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, often in areas far offshore. The ship will be outfitted with a two-vehicle ROV system which will carry high-definition video cameras, still cameras, and oceanographic sensors to water depths up to 6,000 meters. The video signals and data will be transmitted from the ROVs to the ship through a 17mm electric/fiber-optic cable to an ROV control room onboard the ship.  ROV position information will be collected via an Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) acoustic tracking system also located in the ROV control room. The ship will be equipped with a multi-beam sonar system that will be linked to acquisition and map processing workstations co-located in the ROV control room. The objective of the tele-presence system is to ensure the information from these sources is appropriately distributed to work stations onboard the ship, as well as to ensure the information can be transmitted to shore.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address: DHS - Customs and Border Protection, Office of Field Operations, Cargo and Conveyance Security Division, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Room 2.2A, Washington, DC, 20229

Executive Summary: The “SAFE” Port Act (P.L. 109-347), as signed by the President on October 13, 2006, calls for CBP to develop a 1-year Third Party Validation Pilot Program for third party entities to conduct validations under the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT).  As outlined in Section 218 of the Act, CBP has developed the requirements and standard operating procedures, which a third party validator must meet to be eligible for this pilot program.  This announcement outlines the operation of the pilot program, as developed by CBP in consultation with the Commercial Operations Advisory Committee (COAC).  

Background:  Currently, all  C-TPAT validations of member companies are conducted by CBP Supply Chain Security Specialists (SCSSs).  Lesser trade facilitation benefits are afforded to certified members (Tier 1), while validated members (Tier 2 and 3) receive increased benefits, including reduced cargo examinations.  

Although ultimate responsibility for certifying the security and integrity of an international supply chain needs to reside with the U.S. Government, there may be cases where the use of a 3rd party to aid in the validation process would be beneficial.  CBP believes that China is a viable candidate for the Third Party Validation Pilot Program since CBP SCSSs are currently not granted access into China by the Chinese government.   This presents a significant problem to the C-TPAT program in its efforts to determine a C-TPAT member’s commitment to C-TPAT and to verify its degree of compliance to the minimum-security criteria of the C-TPAT program.

Data from 2006 indicates that 55 C-TPAT importer partners currently have exclusive supply chains from China, or 100% of imports originating from China.  An additional 245 C-TPAT importers source over 75% of their imports from China.  

As a result of the inability for CBP to gain access to China to validate these supply chains, C-TPAT importers sourcing from China are given the lowest level of C-TPAT benefits, since CBP is unable to validate or verify their supply chain security practices.  
Until these supply chains have been validated in China, these companies and their Chinese suppliers will be at a competitive disadvantage.  Other C-TPAT members who  import from other countries outside of China will receive greater trade facilitation benefits, such as reduced number of inspections, front of the line inspections, and shorter wait-times at the border. 

CBP has compiled a list of importers who source 75 percent or more of their imports from China, eligible to volunteer for the pilot program.  CBP will notify these importers of their eligibility to participate in the pilot program via the C-TPAT Security Link Web Portal and solicit any volunteers. 

Location
China, with travel within China and the region as needed, directed, and approved by CBP.

Time/Date
This pilot program will remain active up to twelve calendar months, starting on or about May 1, 2007 and ending on or about May 1, 2008.

Third Party Requirements and Duties Performed
Under the announcement, third-party entities may be utilized to augment or assist CBP in validating or verifying the supply chains of C-TPAT members sourcing from China. 

CBP will certify a company’s ability to qualify as a third party entity to conduct C-TPAT validations. The following requirements listed below and further described in the attached Standard Operation Procedures – Customs and Border Protection Third Party Validation Pilot Program (attachment 1) must be met in order to be considered under this announcement:

•	Provide CBP with documentation attesting to its established presence in China.
•	Demonstrate the ability to perform validations in accordance with standard operating procedures and requirements designated by CBP.
•	Agree to perform validation in accordance with such standard operating procedures and requirements (and adhere to any updates to such procedures and requirements as well).
•	Employ a data collection methodology to address and record a company’s compliance with CBP Importer Minimum Security Criteria and be capable of transmitting those findings to CBP in an electronic form.
•	Provide CBP with documented training procedures for the validators.
•	Agree to maintain liability insurance coverage sufficient to satisfy third party claims arising out of an incident arising from their duties as a third party validator.
•	Apply for protections under the Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 or the “SAFETY Act”, as outlined in Section 864 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. (Office of SAFETY Act Implementation (866) 788-9318 www.safetyact.gov); however, the award SAFETY Act protections will not be a factor in an entity’s selection as a validator.  Nor will an entity’s selection as a validator by CBP confer SAFETY Act protections upon that applicant.   
•	The third party firm must agree to a background investigation and/or criminal records check to be performed by CBP/U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on the firm’s principle management and all validators that will be used by the firm.  
•	Provide fee schedules that will be posted on the CBP Web site and have the fees openly available on the company’s Web site.  
•	Agree to sign an agreement to protect all proprietary information of C-TPAT participants with respect to which the entity will conduct validations.

Additional Requirements
Per the SAFE Port Act, the decision to validate a C-TPAT partner will remain solely within the discretion of CBP.  CBP will determine the facilities to be visited, to include the point of stuffing, drayage of the container to the port of export, and the port of export.  Upon completion of the validation, CBP will retain all decisions over the status of the C-TPAT partner.  The third party company must exclude themselves and cannot:

•	Have any beneficial interest in, or any direct or indirect control over the C-TPAT participant for which the validation services are performed. 

•	Have any other issues that can be perceived as conflict of interest with respect to the C-TPAT participant.  

•	Enter into any future supply chain security services contract with the C-TPAT participant for 12-months following the completion of the validation.  

CBP will:

•	Only grant a C-TPAT validation by a third party entity if the C-TPAT participant voluntarily submits to validation by such third party entity.

•	Ensure that the C-TPAT participant has entered into a contract with the third party entity, under which the C-TPAT participant agrees to pay all costs associated with the validation.  

CBP may allow the third party entity to attend the validation meetings with the importer “in-country” and/or in the United States, so that the recommendations produced from the 3rd Party Validation can be reviewed and discussed with the importer.

Monitoring
On a regular basis, CBP will monitor and review the operations of a third party entity conducting validations to ensure that the entity is meeting the requirements of standard operating procedures and all other requirements listed in this document. If CBP determines that a third party entity is not meeting the minimum standard operating procedures and requirements, CBP shall:
•	Review any validations conducted by the entity.
•	Revoke the entity’s certificate of conformance.

Performance Measurements and Evaluations
Those third party firm(s) selected will be subject to periodic performance measurements and evaluations as follows:

(1)	The finding and accuracy of the third party validation and subsequent findings will be evaluated and reviewed against he standard operating procedures and other requirements designated by CBP.
(2)	The findings and assessment of the third party entity will be reviewed to determine whether all C-TPAT minimum-security criteria have been addressed. 
(3)	The third party entity will be subject to random “spot checks” of the C-TPAT participant’s security profile to ensure proper documentation of implemented security policies and procedures.  Additionally, the domestic corporate headquarters site of the C-TPAT participant may be visited to verify security policies and procedures documented by the third party entity.

Selection of Third Party Firm(s)
CBP will identify 3-4 third party firms who best meet the requirements identified by CBP for participation in this pilot program.

Submitting Application and Related Documents 
All application materials and questions must be sent, via email, to the cbp.contractor@dhs.gov no later than April 30, 2007.  

Selection Process 
CBP’s Office of Cargo and Conveyance Security will evaluate the submitted applications based on technical ability to accomplish the stated objectives of the pilot program. CBP will exclude any applicant from consideration if it is unable to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the qualifications based on submitted applications. 

Qualified and otherwise acceptable candidates will then be added to a “qualified bidders list” from which the third party entity (s) are selected. 

Report CBP 
CBP will submit a report to the appropriate congressional and advisory committees no later that 30 days after the completion of the pilot program. This report will contain the following:

(1)	Results of the pilot program, including the extent to which the pilot program ensured sufficient protection of proprietary commercial information.
(2)	Cost and efficiency associated with validations under the pilot program.
(3)	Impact of the pilot program on the rate of validations conducted under C-TPAT.
(4)	Impact on national security of the pilot program
(5)	Recommendations by CBP based upon the results of the pilot program.

In accordance with FAR10.001, the government is conducting market research to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes. This is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. 

The Government will use the information gathered in response to this document to refine acquisition strategy for integrated service solutions. 

The government has approximately 120 Dispense source point-of-use industrial plant equipment in place today and is planning to have an estimated number of 400 when installation is complete. The equipment will be located in 40+ buildings. 

The MRO materials to be stocked include but are not limited to consumables, expendables and personal protection equipment items at each location.  The Government plans to have one provider for all locations and applications. The services to be provide include (1) Manage Dispense Source point-of-use applications (equipment) at specified buildings and locations; (2) Purchase, Deliver, Stock and Replenish all MRO materials and inventory within point-of-use applications, (equipment); (3) Maintain, Cycle Count and Manage all inventory with point-of-use applications (equipment) and virtual cribs. (4) Process, expedite, and follow-up on spot buys and purchases, and; (5) Provide inventory and category management services. 

 For informational purposes only the Government is requesting answers to the following questions:

1. Does your company perform Inventory Management as described above for commercial Industry? Please provide a brief description of the scope of that effort. Can you provide copies of these contracts or Point of Contacts to obtain additional information?

2. Do you provide this or a similar service to a government entity? Which government entity and what are the contract numbers or Point of Contacts?

3. What type of a contract (Firm fixed price, Cost plus fixed fee, Time and Materials etc) would provide the Government the best service and work best for your company to supply this integrated service?

4. If we have a requirement for one-time spot buys for existing Industrial Production Equipment do you have experience with performing this type of service or buy? What type of CLIN structure would you use for this type of requirement?

5. Have you been involved with or used an automated point-of-use system? If yes, please describe the extent and details of that experience.

6. It is unclear what the full scope of an Inventory Product Service requirement will look like at 76MXW over the next year. However, the Government has a partial perspective of what is currently in place. How would you plan for fluctuations in the requirement workload (with only partial history)for a procurement of this nature?

<CONTACT>Sandra  Bellinger , Contracting Officer  , Phone 301-827-7159, Fax 301-827-7101, Email sandra.bellinger@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  This is not a solicitation or Request for Proposals.  At this time, the Government is only seeking information for market research purposes.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are seeking information from interested parties on the formation of a public-private partnership whose goal it would be to establish and maintain a common electronic platform (e-platform) for the exchange of clinical research data (i.e., the data normally collected during the course of a clinical trial), as well as the submission, receipt, and management of regulatory product information.  Such a platform for managing data gathered on medical products all along the regulatory product information supply chain would make use of available bioinformatics technology to systematize the exchange of medical product information beginning in the earliest stage of clinical research through approval to postmarket surveillance, greatly enhancing the efficiency of exchanging medical product information among all interested parties.  Such an effort would also be a big step toward the fulfillment of the President’s National health IT effort, one goal of which is to make medical products safer and more effective than ever before.  

FDA and NIH are seeking information from persons who are interested in participating in and willing to serve as the conveners of such a public-private partnership. The partnership would develop, maintain, and manage a common e-platform and also identify and encourage development of standards relevant to these activities. These functions would support the exchange of data among members of the clinical research community, the exchange of medical product information for regulatory review, and the sharing of data for other, yet-to-be-identified purposes.  The public private partnership that undertakes this effort would (1) transition existing electronic components into the e-platform, (2) work with standards development organizations (SDOs) (e.g., ISO, Health Level Seven) to develop and approve standards, (3) develop and implement additional supporting functions and exchange tools, including the necessary server security requirements, and (4)  oversee management and maintenance of the e-platform.  

A.	PURPOSE
	THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quotations (RFQ)) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, we are not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party’s expense.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. 
	We also are requesting information from small businesses, which includes Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Women-Owned Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses. All small businesses are strongly encouraged to provide responses to this RFI. This will assist us in determining the potential levels of interest, competition, and technical capability to provide the required services within the Small Business community.  In addition, this information may also be used to assist in establishing a baseline for developing any subsequent potential subcontracting plan small business goal percentages, as necessary.
Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement.  Neither FDA nor NIH will be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.  

B.	DEFINITIONS
e-Platform:  a common electronic platform for the efficient collection, management, and exchange of data related to clinical research, medical product development, and regulatory product submissions.  
Public-private partnership:  an entity convened among government and private organizations with the intent of accomplishing common goal.  Frequently an organization, often a nonprofit entity, serves as the focal point for organizing a public-private partnership. 

C.	GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION
	FDA is in the process of developing an e-platform for the receipt, management, review, and storage of regulatory product information.  The interest of the NIH in the development of such an e-platform is in the interface of drug development and research.  On December 18, FDA and NIH held a public hearing (November 21, 2006; 71 FR 67356) to solicit general views and information from interested persons on issues concerning the electronic submission of product information to the agency.  Among other things, the agencies were interested in hearing the views of, and soliciting information from, interested persons on the feasibility of developing and implementing an all-electronic submission environment, as well as on issues related to developing an electronic regulatory information exchange platform that would be managed and maintained by a third party.  In the notice announcing the Public Hearing, FDA explained that, during the past decade, it has been moving toward transforming all regulatory submissions from paper to electronic means. In addition, FDA and NIH have been collaborating on a number of projects that will automate, thus improve, data sharing between NIH-funded clinical investigators and the FDA. To meet this goal, a series of actions have already been undertaken: 
FDA issued regulations related to voluntary electronic submission of regulatory information and provided a docket listing all submissions that we accept electronically (e.g., electronic records and electronic signatures, 21 CFR part 11; docket 92S–0251; http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/ 92s0251/92s0251.htm)
IFDA issued regulations requiring, or proposing to require, electronic submission of certain regulatory information (e.g., the electronic submission of the content of labeling (December 11, 2003; 68 FR 69009), and manufacturer registration and listing of drug products (August 29, 2006; 71 FR 51275))

FDA issued numerous guidance documents to assist in the submission of various regulatory documents in electronic format (e.g., electronic common technical document, certain premarket applications, and postmarketing information; see http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm#electronic%20submissions) 
FDA issued notices related to electronic submission (e.g., availability of the FDA electronic submissions gateway (http://www.fda.gov/esg/default.htm))
NIH and FDA collaborated with manufacturers  vendors,  healthcare information suppliers, and other interested parties to develop data standards, and to build databases for sharing certain clinical trial information, such as FIREBIRD and Janus (see http://crix.nci.nih.gov/projects/Firebird/ and http://crix.nci.nih.gov/projects/janus/, respectively). 
 The notice announcing the part 15 public hearing also explained that FDA and NIH were considering technological and other feasibility issues related to the electronic submission of premarket applications to FDA, as well as the electronic submission of other regulatory information (e.g., postmarketing information and amendments to applications).  FDA  had concluded that, rather than continue to encourage voluntary electronic submissions—although the agency still encourages such submissions—proactively facilitating electronic submissions by requiring such submissions would help promote the automation of healthcare information, a key goal in the President’s electronic health initiative and part of the long-term Federal goal of ensuring that health information systems are interoperable.  Advances such as these will speed development of new medical technology and provide healthcare professionals and consumers the information they need to make well informed decisions regarding the safe and effective use of medical products, resulting in better health outcomes.
	In their collaborations on FIREBIRD and Janus,  FDA and NIH have also become aware of the potential benefits of having a common e-platform that could be administered by a third party entity or entities (e.g. private or nonprofit entities not otherwise engaged in clinical research activities, as is currently the case with small components of FDA’s electronic infrastructure) with relevant expertise and organizational leadership who could facilitate, coordinate, and manage all of the functions necessary for efficient collection and maintenance of clinical research data as well as pre- and postmarket electronic submissions. For example, a third party entity might perform the following tasks:
Build an electronic platform
Maintain data warehouses
Transition existing electronic data and information repositories to the electronic platform
Work with SDOs
Produce other necessary components to facilitate electronic access and management of information 
Manage and support these functions
	At the Part 15 public hearing, stakeholders had the opportunity to address specific topics and present their views, recommendations, and any other pertinent information related to these issues.  In particular, FDA and NIH asked stakeholders to present input on issues related to the concept and feasibility of an electronic platform that would facilitate the exchange of clinical research information among research organizations and the exchange of regulatory product information between sponsors and the FDA, the role of a public-private partnership in the creation and assessment of such a platform, and the management of the platform after its creation by a private entity or entities with the relevant technological expertise. 
	In this request for information, FDA and NIH are soliciting additional detail about such a plan and are seeking specific input related to issues raised during the Part 15 public hearing. 

D.	QUESTIONS ASKED IN ANTICIPATION OF THE PART 15 HEARING
 In the notice announcing the Part 15 hearing, FDA and NIH asked for input on the following questions:
What are your general viewpoints on a third party entity or entities 	providing services related to such an electronic platform?
What are your views on the establishment of a public-private partnership to initiate formation of an electronic platform?
How do you envision the business model and nature of the third party entity or entities?
What are the necessary attributes and characteristics of the third party entity or entities?
What services could the third party entity or entities provide?
What collaborative efforts on the part of FDA and NIH with a third party entity would be beneficial to establish services?

E.	 ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS RESULTING FROM  INPUT GATHERED DURING AND AFTER THE PART 15 PUBLIC HEARING
What characteristics of the business plan for a public-private partnership would ensure that such an entity would be self-sustaining?
What would the membership of such a public-private partnership look like and how would the engagement of stakeholders be obtained and maintained?
How would international standards be used and extended, and how would prototype infrastructure and applications be developed and extended into production capability?
What would an e-platform look like and how would the interfaces between the research components and the FDA and among various members of the broad research community be structured and supported?
How would data security be guaranteed?
What is the optimum approach to building the electronic platform?
If a modular approach is used, what order of implementation would be best?
How can we contain costs to the government and to stakeholders?
How can we balance benefit and cost for stakeholders who are small businesses?
What is a reasonable estimate of time from concept to implementation?  

F.	DESIRED TECHNICAL GOALS 
The desired technical goal is the development of an e-platform for the exchange of clinical data and the receipt, management, exchange, review, and storage of regulatory product information.

G.	DESIRED BUSINESS INFORMATION 
	The desired business information is how best to create a public-private partnership that is self-sustaining to undertake the goal outlined in section F. 

H.	SUBMISSION OF COMMENTS:  ALL COMMENTS SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL.

(AKG),  2100 Reston Parkway, Suite 400, Reston VA  20191,   for Phase Two of the migration of combat development-related business activities to a virtual working environment (VWE) . Combat development is comprised of dynamic processes and functions, producing and sustaining integrated capabilities that meet the needs of the Marine Corps and the combatant commanders.  The Expeditionary Force Development System (EFDS) provides continuous examination and evaluation of current and emerging concepts and capabilities to improve and sustain a modern Marine Corps as well as the capability to respond to urgent emerging needs in support of the Global War on Terror (GWOT).  Associated products of EFDS include the requirement for analysis of strategic guidance, the identification of capability needs within the context of determined scenarios, the identification of current capabilities and resultant gaps, solution identification and resourcing within the POM process.  The government requires expertise in EFDS and its sub-processes, as well as the organization, functions, and command relationships applicable within MCCDC and HQMC staff activities, as they relate to t!  he effective management and execution of EFDS. The combinations of these needs are best fulfilled by utilization of a Virtual Work Environment (VWE). A VWE is defined as “An adaptable, integrated, shared community workspace where co-located or distributed people can collaborate, work on tasks, and solve problems cooperatively using organizational intellectual capital (knowledge) and processes virtually.”  This is the second and final phase of this requirement.  Phase 1 efforts were focused on VWE processes, worker behaviors, and establishing limited training methods within a very select group within MCCDC – CDD.   The goals of Phase 2 are to (1)  Analysis of the practices and concepts from Phase 1 that can be articulated and implemented across other MCCDC subordinate units, (2) Document VWE practices and concepts as guidelines which can be utilized by other USMC commands to create their virtual work environments quickly and with reduced risk of failure, (3) Create a total VWE training infrastructure (including guides, instructions, and examples of best practices) to support MCCDC and other USMC organizations VWE Adoption, and; (4)  Assist MCCDC in transitioning through the current ‘tipping point’ to become a self supporting VWE environment. The period of performance will be Seven (7) months from date of award;  This notice is not a request for proposals.  No solicitaton document is available.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.   POC: Carol Neely, Regional Contracting Office-NE, carol.neely@usmc.mil  See Note 22.

C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST). This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP printers. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the HP 1200d Printer as a key component to produce emergency photo-digitized passports at overseas Posts. The HP1200d was selected for this purpose because results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. in tests of commercial, non-custom ink jet printers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s requirements. The 1200d uses some color in producing a grayscale printout. Other manufacturers’ printers solely use black ink for this printing option. The introduction of color in the generation of grayscale images significantly improves their quality and enhances overall document security since illicit duplication and image substitution is more difficult. In addition, other manufacturers were found to use an ink formula that appeared to degrade output resolution and print quality, thereby lessening the security of these travel documents. Lastly, a key issue in choosing the HP1200d was its proven ability to reliably feed the special stock used in the generation of emergency passport books. Other printers experienced a higher rate of paper jams and stock spoilage because they were unable to handle paper of the weight and substrate finish used by the DoS. It should be noted that the only other printer that was judged to meet the Department’s specifications was the Ricoh G700, which cannot be procured or fielded because it is not BAA/TAA compliant. In summation, the continued use of the HP 1200d printer, rather than the introduction of another manufacturer’s product at this stage in the program’s life cycle, is deemed to be the most cost effective course of action. No other BAA/TAA compliant printer fully meets the Department’s requirements. The continued use of one make and model printer, the 1200D, eliminates the need to purchase, maintain and account for inventories of spare parts, cables, cleaning kits, ink cartridges and other accessories for multiple printer types. Moreover, the selection of the 1200d obviates the need to train end users in the use and maintenance of multiple printers As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The HP 1200D Printer has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation.

I	Description of Requirement.

Federal agencies relocating to the new Federal building, 90 Seventh St., San Francisco, CA  94103, have a requirement for satellite TV service. The Federal building is near completion and agencies are scheduled to begin moving into the building in March 2007. 

The building consists of two structures: an eighteen-story tower with raised floors and a four-story conventional building. The building (both structures) is supported by a standard cable infrastructure with two identical IDF closets on each floor.  All horizontal cable in the building is Cat 5E.  The design of the tower portion of the building is designed as a green building. There is very limited space in the existing conduits to support the installation of horizontal coaxial cable. Therefore, the contractor must use existing, Government-furnished, Cat 5E to connect to the end device. 

At this time, there is no TV service to each floor and to the office spaces. Therefore, this requirement consists of delivering satellite TV service from the commercial carrier to the various agencies throughout the building.

	1. Deliver satellite TV service to approximately 50 users using existing, Government-furnished Cat 5E cable.

	2. Install Cat 5E distribution hubs (equal to or better than Endeleo brand) and terminate on Government-furnished Cat 5E jacks on the customers' Cat 5E patch panel, Data Two jack, unless specified differently by the agency.

	3. Provide and install all equipment and cabling in accordance with industry specifications.

	4. Provide, at a minimum, the following 12 channels:

1	        KTVU (2) - Independent FOX; 
2	        KNTV (11) - NBC San Jose; 
3	        KPIX (5) - CBS San Francisco; 
4	        KGO (7) - ABC San Francisco; 
5	        Weather Channel; 
6	        Bloomberg; 
7	        Fox News Channel; 
8	        CNBC; 
9	        MSNBC; 
10	        CNN; 
11	        CSPAN-1; 
12	        CSPAN-2. 

	5. Complete all work no later than March 31, 2007.

II	Instructions for submission of quote.

	1. Itemize all equipment, quantities, unit prices, and amounts. 

	2. Provide the title of each labor category, number of hours, hourly rate, and amount.

	3. Describe the sequence of work that will be performed from start to completion. Providing a milestone schedule is desirable.

	4. Provide three references for similar work completed within the past two years, including contract number, brief description of the work, name and telephone number of the point of contact, and name and address of the work location.

III.	Evaluation Criteria

Evaluation of offers will be based on three factors: technical description, including items offered; past performance; and price. To be considered technically acceptable, the offeror must clearly demonstrate the firm is capable of performing the required work and completing it on or before March 31, 2007.

IV	Method of Award

The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures.

V	Government Points of Contact

Any questions of a technical nature or requests for site visits should be directed to Mr. John Archdeacon at (415) 522-4530 or via e-mail at john.archdeacon@gsa.gov. All other questions or concerns should be directed to Jo Ann Lew at (415) 522-4550 or via e-mail at joann.lew@gsa.gov.

VI	Due Date for Receipt of Quotes

(End of provision) 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2)  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial supply prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued.  The purchase request number is M6789807RCG8468, and is a brand name requirement. This procurement is a Total Set-Aside for Small Business in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. The North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) is 334111, Electronic Computer Manufacturing, the size standard of which is 1,000 employees (Not to exceed). For the purpose of bidding on Federal contracts that are set aside for small business, the concern must self-certify to be a small business under the appropriate size standard set forth in this synopsitation. The size of the concern at the time of self-certification prevails for that contract. A concern may grow above the size standard before or after award without loss of eligibility to perform on that contract.  DESCRIPTION:  Clear Cube Equipment.  REQUIREMENTS:  MARCENT currently owns and operates 32 ClearCube blade systems. The ClearCube system is known as a Thin-Client solution. Each blade is the equivalent of a desktop computer. The blades are stored in a central location and are accessed by the end user through a small box placed on their desk. To the end user, it appears and functions the same as having a computer on the desk. Due to the lack of space at MARCENT, it was determined that this would be the medium of choice in the past. Now, MARCENT personnel have been using the ClearCube systems for a year and MARCENT has a vested interest in money, training, and personnel. The use of ClearCube systems has reduced space allocation, cost per user access, power consumption by ITE systems, and has simplified network management. The additional systems would expand out desktop support to others users while still allowing us to operate within our space constraints. By ordering ClearCube equipment, we eliminate any need for money to be spent on training or man hours lost troubleshooting unfamiliar systems. Additionally, the ClearCube systems would be interchangeable with our existing ClearCube architecture allowing quick and easy installation and eliminating the need to administer two disparate systems. If ClearCubes were not used, this would mean installing a similar system separately and administering two systems adding overhead for training and management. If an "alike" system could not be found, then full desktop computers would have to be ordered which would not fit within the space confines here within the MARCENT headquarters building.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Integrated Genomics, Inc., for renewal of ERGO Server License, Update, Gene Expression Module, and Genomic Data Supplement in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a Notice of Intent (NOI-RML #7022).  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16 dated 3/22/07. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and is a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500. The Rocky Mountain Laboratories(RML), is in need of a ERGO license renewal.  RML has sequenced several pathogen genomes.  Determining the chemical sequence of the DNA of the pathogenic organisms is a critical first step in the development of diagnostics, vaccines and chemotherapeutics against deadly human pathogens.  A critical aspect of sequencing and processing of the data from multiple bacterial genomes is the use of servers and bioinformatics software to store, analyze and present genome data.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price type contract for Hotel Accommodations, Conference Space Rental and Hotel Services located in one of the following geographic areas:  Washington, DC or Baltimore, MD.    Request for Proposal VA-777-07-RP-0013  is in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6-Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items. This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.  For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror, not the hotel, is to be considered the prime contractor.  Therefore, that offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor and must also include a copy of all insurance(s) (standard business, liability, extraordinary insurances) in order to submit a complete technical proposal for evaluation purposes.

<CONTACT>Jo Ann Lew, Contracting Officer, Phone 415-522-4550, Fax 415-522-4720, Email joann.lew@gsa.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation.

I	Description of Requirement.

Federal agencies relocating to the new Federal building, 90 Seventh St., San Francisco, CA  94103, have a requirement for satellite TV service. The Federal building is near completion and agencies are scheduled to begin moving into the building in March 2007. 

The building consists of two structures: an eighteen-story tower with raised floors and a four-story conventional building. The building (both structures) is supported by a standard cable infrastructure with two identical IDF closets on each floor.  All horizontal cable in the building is Cat 5E.  The design of the tower portion of the building is designed as a green building. There is very limited space in the existing conduits to support the installation of horizontal coaxial cable. Therefore, the contractor must use existing, Government-furnished, Cat 5E to connect to the end device. 

At this time, there is no TV service to each floor and to the office spaces. Therefore, this requirement consists of delivering satellite TV service from the commercial carrier to the various agencies throughout the building.

	1. Deliver satellite TV service to approximately 50 users using existing, Government-furnished Cat 5E cable.

	2. Install Cat 5E distribution hubs (equal to or better than Endeleo brand) and terminate on Government-furnished Cat 5E jacks on the customers' Cat 5E patch panel, Data Two jack, unless specified differently by the agency.

	3. Provide and install all equipment and cabling in accordance with industry specifications.

	4. Provide, at a minimum, the following 12 channels:

1	        KTVU (2) - Independent FOX; 
2	        KNTV (11) - NBC San Jose; 
3	        KPIX (5) - CBS San Francisco; 
4	        KGO (7) - ABC San Francisco; 
5	        Weather Channel; 
6	        Bloomberg; 
7	        Fox News Channel; 
8	        CNBC; 
9	        MSNBC; 
10	        CNN; 
11	        CSPAN-1; 
12	        CSPAN-2. 

	5. Complete all work no later than March 31, 2007.

II	Instructions for submission of quote.

	1. Itemize all equipment, quantities, unit prices, and amounts. 

	2. Provide the title of each labor category, number of hours, hourly rate, and amount.

	3. Describe the sequence of work that will be performed from start to completion. Providing a milestone schedule is desirable.

	4. Provide three references for similar work completed within the past two years, including contract number, brief description of the work, name and telephone number of the point of contact, and name and address of the work location.

III.	Evaluation Criteria

Evaluation of offers will be based on three factors: technical description, including items offered; past performance; and price. To be considered technically acceptable, the offeror must clearly demonstrate the firm is capable of performing the required work and completing it on or before March 31, 2007.

IV	Method of Award

The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures.

V	Government Points of Contact

Any questions of a technical nature or requests for site visits should be directed to Mr. John Archdeacon at (415) 522-4530 or via e-mail at john.archdeacon@gsa.gov. All other questions or concerns should be directed to Jo Ann Lew at (415) 522-4550 or via e-mail at joann.lew@gsa.gov.

VI	Due Date for Receipt of Quotes

Your offer is due on or before 4:00 PM local time, Friday, March 2, 2007, and should be sent via e-mail to Jo Ann Lew at the above address. No late offers will be accepted or considered.

Vendor questions and the Government's answers are provided below.

Q1. The solicitation is requesting TV service to approximately 50 users using Endeleo hubs. Since the Endeleo FG-TVM-1600 Hub has 16 ports, should we provide a price for 3 Hubs (for up to only 48 users) or should we provide a price for 4 Hubs that will provide service for up to 64 users.	

A1. For evaluation purposes, include four (4) hubs in your quote.

Q2. An Endeleo User Module will be required at each television location, so do you want us to provide pricing for the same number of users as we have ports (48 or 64) or do you want the number of user modules to match the number of televisions that you will be using?

A2. For evaluation purposes, pricing should be based on 64 ports.

Q3. Do you already have the television sets for each user location?

A3. Government agencies are responsible for providing and may already have television sets.

Q4. The output of the Endeleo User Module is Audio/Video and the module does not have an RF output (channel 3, 4 etc.)  Do the TV's have an Audio/Video Input?	

A4. Individual agencies will be responsible for providing television sets with the required capabilities.

Q5. The Endeleo user Module can sit on top of a TV or can be hidden behind a wall mounted LCD or Plasma TV. If the module is hidden, a remote IR sensor will be needed. Will we mount the user module on TV or behind the TV?	

A5. For evaluation purposes, assume half will be mounted on the TV and half behind the TV.

Q6. The Endeleo User Module has front panel push buttons for up/down channel selection. An Endeleo remote control is optional. Do you want the remote controls?

A6. Yes, please include remote controls.

Q7. What is the approximate distance from the dish location (on roof) to the satellite receiver in the headend room?

A7. For evaluation purposes, assume the distance is 500 feet.

Q8. Do you foresee any problem with us getting the coax cables from the dish on the roof to the satellite receivers in the headend room?

A8. There should be no problem installing your cable. The Government has identified the path from the rooftop through the ceiling on the 4th floor of the Annex to Room B331 (MDF ROOM) in the basement.  (END)

<DESC>Amendment 0001: This modififcation is issued to answer questions. 1)Q: Will the main AC Electrical Service panel need to include Transient Voltage Surge Suppression (TVSS)? A: Yes, I plan to keep and operate motorola radio equipment in the building.  If a Type 1 TVSS is required to uphold warranty then yes please include it. 2) Q: Can you tell me how far off the main road each site will be?  This is to inquire on how much of a chance there will be for a vehicle to get stuck in sand. A:   The buildings will be located in KFR at OP64.  They will be placed approximately 50 meters off the main access road.  This main access road is KLM road.  KLM road is not paved but it is regularly maintained.  Chances of getting stuck are very slim.  T he problem would arise if, for example, truck driver takes a wrong turn and tries to make a u-turn.  When making the u-turn, the truck driver may fail to recognize soft sand while turning and get stuck. However, I intend to have the trucks escorted in from   the gate to minimize chances of truck taking a wrong turn. 3)Q: What type of equipment is this shelter going to house?  Radio, RF, Data Networking, etc? A: This building will be used to conduct counter battery radar testing, items that will be housed inside the buildings include but are not limited to: computers, monitors, a printer, a shredder, radar diagnostic equipment, radar spare parts, hand tools, ch airs, desks, telephones, radios, cabinets, bookcases and office stationary.    4) Q:Will this building be used for public safety (P25) applications, or dedicated solely to military/government use?
