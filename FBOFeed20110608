<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seeks to continue development a set of implementation guides that use the Health Level Seven (HL7) Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) standard for reporting healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) from healthcare facilities that use vendor infection control surveillance applications to CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). <br />The NHSN is a web-based information system designed for the purpose of improving patient and healthcare personnel safety. The principal goal of the NHSN is to improve safety by creating and disseminating knowledge necessary to detect and respond to current and emerging healthcare safety threats. The public health importance of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) has prompted an increasing number of States to enact laws requiring hospitals to report HAI data to the health department or another State agency. In 24 States that have enacted mandatory reporting requirements as of June 2011, state statutes or implementation plans call for hospitals to report HAI data to the health department or another State agency using the NHSN. The number of healthcare facilities participating in NHSN has more than tripled since then, primarily because of the increasing use of NHSN by States in their implementations of HAI public reporting mandates. A substantial additional increase in NHSN participation is anticipated as more States enact mandatory reporting requirements and opt to use NHSN to implement their new mandates. In addition, the Centers for Medicare/Medicaid's use of NHSN for the IPPS reporting of Central-line Assoicationed Bloodstream and Surgical Site Infection events.
<p><br />Award of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract IAW/FAR Part 12 is being contemplated.

<DESC>The 10th Contracting Squadron, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA), Colorado, intends to award a sole source purchase order to AITech Defense Systems for the following items:
<p>Quantity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Description<br />1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S950-R-00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flight Computer</p>
<p>This item is required for use by the Air Force Academy Department of Astronautics. The AiTECH processor was chosen for FalconSAT-5 based upon its performance and technical requirements. USAFA has written more than 325,000 lines of software code for the FalconSAT 5 mission. FalconSAT-6 will be very similar to FalconSAT-5, only a few payloads will change, we therefore plan on using the same software for this mission. Since the software was uniquely written for the AiTECH processor, if another processor was chosen, we would have to rewrite our entire software, which would cost us 3 years in time, and at least $350K. All of this software was written by the Academy with our research contractors.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be done in accordance with FAR 12 and 13 procedures. This reference document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular Fac 2005-52, effective 31 May 2011.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334111 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. DO NOT submit a bid/quote at this time.</p>
<p>Any vendor that feels they have the ability to meet this requirement may submit information (3 pages or less) to support their claim. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement can be conducted. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received NLT 9 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on June 13, 2011. Responses received after this will be considered late IAW FAR 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this announcement. Contractors must have a current registration with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov and with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov .</p>
<p>Questions should be addressed to the Primary POC James Lovely, Contract Specialist, (719) 333-8161 or sent via e-mail to James.Lovely@usafa.af.mil. Alternate POC is Nicole Baert, Contracting Officer, (719) 333-8924, Nicole.Baert@usafa.af.mil.</p>
<p>5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (APR 10)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen, <br />Kim Diercks<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-9018<br />email: kim.diercks@usafa.af.mil</p>
<p>Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<CONTACT>Donald Richardson, 202-385-8415

<DESC>The FAA is responsible for aviation weather observation services at designated locations, primarily airports, throughout the United States including remote sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico. Since March 1995, the FAA has satisfied this responsibility through the use of the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), or the Aviation Weather Observing System (AWOS), FAA employees and contract weather observer personnel.
Presently, the Contract Weather Observation (CWO) program utilizes 15 contractors, predominantly small and very small businesses, which provide weather observation services at 148 contract sites in FAA-owned or FAA-leased locations. 
The following summary represents the CWO locations aligned within the three (3) Service Areas.  They will be further divided into groups.  
- Eastern Service Area contains approximately 54 sites within the following states: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.  
- Central Service Area contains approximately 48 sites within the following states: Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.
- Western Service Area contains approximately 24 sites within the following states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, and Hawaii.  
Alaska Service Area contains approximately 22 sites within the state of Alaska. 

Objective:
The objective of this Market Survey/RFI is to solicit feedback from sources capable of performing aviation weather observation services.  It is the FAA's intent to inform industry of a planned competitive contract(s) (estimated at over $100 million dollars) that will provide for aviation weather observer personnel to augment the ASOS and AWOS at selected airports throughout the United States, including remote sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico. The small business community primarily provides the CWO Program its current weather observation services.  The FAA is now seeking to identify potential small businesses that have the experience and qualifications necessary to perform the services required. No solicitation package is currently available.  However, the applicable North American Industry Classification System Code for this requirement is 541990.  This future contracting opportunity will be set-aside for competition among small businesses unless the FAA determines that no adequate competition or capable small business sources exists. The FAA encourages subcontracting and teaming arrangements by all participants.   
The FAA seeks to identify small businesses and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals that possess the following knowledge and experience:
1. Knowledge of FAA and National Weather Service (NWS) Orders, directives and policy relating to CWO services.
2. Knowledge, familiarity or experience with ASOS or AWOS.
3. Knowledge and understanding of the National Airspace System (NAS).
4. Previous experience providing or managing aviation weather observation service at multiple locations.
5. Previous experience, knowledge or management capability for a small business to manage other small businesses and/or small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in a contractual arrangement that would include handling payroll and reports for multiple locations or subcontractors. 
6.  The ability to provide and manage an aviation weather observation-training program.

<RESPDATE>061511
<CONTACT>Jonathan M. Lear, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014514470, Email learj@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Greiner Bio-One North America, Inc., 4238 Capital Drive, Monroe, NC 28110-7681 to provide the following well plates:</p>
<p>-	1536W, PS, BLK/CLR, ST, TC, 2BRCDS, 60/CS<br />-	1536W, PS, WHT, TC, ST, Barcode, 60/CS</p>
<p>This request is for 1536-well plates to be used on the Kalypsys and Aspect robotic systems currently being used in the NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC). As part of the Roadmap Initiative, NCGC currently screens, identifies, and distributes to the research community small molecule compounds, and data on their activities, to accelerate translation of the completed human genome into advancements in human health.  Components of the organization include a repository of up to 500,000 - 1,000,000 chemical compounds; assay development capacity; Robotic compound screening, also termed high throughput screening (HTS); medicinal chemistry to transform &lsquo;hits' identified by HTS into workable chemical probes; Chem-informatics capacity for data mining and virtual screening; and distribution capacity to efficiently disseminate the reagents to the biomedical research community.</p>
<p>The Kalypsys and Aspect systems are using cutting edge technologies not currently found within other NIH facilities or most pharmaceutical companies. These systems run reliably with cell-based biochemical assays, and are optimized to run on the 1536-well format as opposed to the normal and commonly used 384-well capability. This feature alone makes for a more efficient and cost saving characteristic due to the high number of assays to be created by the center.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that Greiner provides custom 1536-well plates that are needed for reliable handling and durability during robotic assay runs.  They also provide custom bar-codes for the plates.  They are clear 1536-well micro plates manufactured from virgin polystyrene resin selected for high optical clarity. The plates are RNase-free, non-pyrogenic and free of DNA-polymerase-inhibitors. These plates feature a 1 &mu;L to 10 &mu;L working volume per well, which is crucial to the operation, all other plates sampled are useless below 10uL.</p>
<p>Greiner Bio-One 1536-well plates meet industry standard dimension specifications to facilitate compatibility with micro plate handling equipment and robotics. The square-round well geometry is designed to minimize wicking and reduce air bubble formation which is necessary in assay development, while increasing volume capacity and surface area.  These plates are currently being used by the NCGC and it is important to maintain consistency in the numerous ongoing projects.  No other plates have been able to function at such low capacities as the Greiner plates have on the equipment.</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 326199, All Other Plastics Product Manufacturing, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  However, this solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses. This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-50 (May 16, 2011).</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by June 15, 2011 at 12:00pm Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements.</p>
<p>Inquiries to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2011-195-JML, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions,   COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6151, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Jonathan Lear.

<p>Title: Specialized IT Support</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOLE/SINGLE SOURCE, NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This sole / single source, non-competitive notice is prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 5 &amp; 13. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Far Part 6 - Competition Requirements, is not applicable to contracts awarded using simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13, not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-50 (effective May 16, 2011).</p>
<p>The Period of Performance is one twelve (12) month base year.</p>
<p>The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $150,000.00.</p>
<p>The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 541310 and the associated small business size standard is $4.5 Million.</p>
<p>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order for specialized IT support, on a sole source non competitive basis to DP Consultant Inc., 7105 Fox Harbor Way Elkridge, MD 21075-6570.</p>
<p>The basis for the sole source determination is based upon the fact that:</p>
<p>DP Consultants is setting up, and documenting, a methodology to automatically inventory the software on all IT systems within NIAMS. This inventory is essential in ensuring NIAMS software usage is in accordance with the software license counts. In addition, this data is used to respond to iSDP data calls and the accuracy of this data is critical. Non-accuracy of the data will result in NIAMS being forced to buy additional copies and pay significant fines.</p>
<p>Moreover, DP Consultants has set up an ongoing Altiris packaging project that enables a standardized OS image to be developed and deployed by the Desktop Support Team, in a fraction of the time it would take to install the OS on each system being deployed. This package is constantly changing as security enhancements are made to the OS and as NIAMS standardizes additional software. <br /><br />In addition, DP Consultants provides on-going specialized IT support to NIAMS executives, supporting their variety of equipment and their many operational locations, both local and remote.</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a response. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. 


The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, RI (NUWCDIVNPT) intends to award a Firm Fixed Price, Sole Source contract to Ultra Electronics Ocean Systems (Ultra), Braintree, MA.  The NUWCDIVNPT requirement is for 27 DT-513D Hydrophones to be delivered 28 weeks after receipt of order.
  Ultra was the previous provider of this item under contract N66604-04-D-1243 and is the only vendor that is certified by NUWCDIVNPT to provide the DT-513D Hydrophones.   This item is essential to fleet readiness, and the Government estimates based on past experience that the first article test, certification, and delivery of production units would take 30 months if the award were made to a vendor other than Ultra.  This does not meet the Governmentâs required delivery schedule.  This is a one-time buy until solicitation N66604-11-R-0679, which is the follow-on to N66604-04-D-1243, can be awarded. The NAICS is 334511; size standard is 750 Employees.  The proposed contract action is for 27 DT-513D Hydrophones for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.
 The Govenment anticipates releasing the solicitation on or around 6/22/1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. 

NOTE: This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION PROJECT - Construction Project 649-11-106, Modernize-Replace Communications Infrastructure Phase I, II & III, Bob Stump VA Medical Center. The Phoenix VA Healthcare System (PVAHCS), Phoenix Arizona, intends to issue a solicitation requesting proposals to provide all work shown on the drawings and included in the specifications.  Work includes, but is not limited to: total replacement of the existing fiber backbone with high speed single mode and high speed multi-mode fiber.  The Northern Arizona VA Health Center fiber optic communications system has developed over time on an "as-needed" basis, connecting computer servers to terminal locations, fire alarms, security monitors and building digital control systems to monitoring stations at the Boiler Plant and the VA Police Department.  Most of the connections between the buildings are routed through the steam tunnels, and where no steam tunnels existed, underground conduit has been installed to connect the steam tunnels to the terminal locations to complete the fiber communication runs.  Some sections of the existing fiber optic network have been in service for over 25 years, well beyond its expected service life.  By current standards, the existing fiber system is extremely slow, and for the most part, incapable of carrying any additional data.  The system is also based on the assumption that optical fiber is inherently secure and that data couldn't be "siphoned" off the system.  The NAVAHCS fiber optic infrastructure does not meet current industry, VA or NIST 800-53 standards.  Our current fiber optic distribution system is working at capacity and more capacity is needed.  The system also needs to be secured against data theft, and a substantial portion of the system has degraded to an unacceptable level of reliability.  The problems with the system are system-wide and cannot be reasonably addressed on a case-by-case basis.   A full scope of work will be included in the solicitation documents.  Performance Period is 180 calendar days after receiving Notice to Proceed. Complete drawings and specifications will be included in the solicitation document that will be available on FedBizOpps on or about June 23, 2011.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>  Brachytherapy Prostate Implant Program
Statement of Work
1.	Service to be procured Brachytherapy Implantation of I-125 radioactive seeds for patients with prostate cancer.
2.	All work will be performed on-site at the VA Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH.
3.	Will require a team to include Radiation Oncologist (Authorized User [AU] and Medical Physicists) capable of being placed on the VA Nuclear Medicine permit.
4.	The Brachytherapy team will provide ongoing guidance and assistance in maintaining and improving the brachytherapy program at the Cincinnati VA Medical Center.
5.	Vendor must follow the ACR Guidelines and NHPP Guidelines (see attachments).   
 
6.	 Procedure charges will be based on an hourly rate for physicians (Brachytherapists) and physicists not to exceed the Center for Medicare Services (CMS) rates.  The Cincinnati VAMC estimates are 10-80 procedures per year.  
Physician Component (Brachytherapist):
1.	 The brachytherapist will review all prospective patients for possible prostate implants and confer with referring physicians as needed. This requires use of the VA electronic patient record as well as the use of Vista Web.
2.	The brachytherapist will complete an Ultrasound for treatment planning for each implant patient.
3.	The brachytherapist will prepare a treatment plan and provide a signed copy to the VA Nuclear Medicine Service to perform seed loading.
4.	The brachytherapist will complete all components of the implant procedure in the operating room or other approved designated procedure room on site at the VA Medical Center.
5.	The brachytherapist must be able to meet all requirements mandated by the VHA National Health Physics Program (NHPP), as well as Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requirements.
6.	The brachytherapist may perform other types of brachytherapy when clinically indicated, such as eye plaques (Ophthalmology) and lung implants (Thoracic Surgery). The Cincinnati VA Medical Center currently has the equipment and clinical expertise required in these specialties outside of this prostate contract.
7.	Because the brachytherapy program is subject to external reviews by the NRC, VA NHPP and possibly the Office of Inspector General (OIG), an hourly rate will be paid for these services.  Estimated quantity will be ten hours per year, if an inspection occurs.  A sign-in and sign-out sheet will be kept by the COTR.  
8.	Residents/Fellows will be supervised by the Brachytherapist during all implant procedures.

Physicist Component:	
1.	The physicist will complete acceptance testing of the Treatment Planning System (10 CFR 35.457) to meet the American College of Radiology (ACR) requirements and provide a signed copy to the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO).
2.	The physicist will certify each year, or as required after system maintenance or system upgrades,   the Ultrasound unit and Image transfer from CT to the Treatment Planning System (TPSS).  A signed copy of the certification(s) is to be provided to the RSO.
3.	The physicist will annually review calibration measurements, or as required after system maintenance or system upgrades, for sealed sources to meet 10 CFR 35.432 requirements.  Will provide a signed written copy to the RSO.
4.	The physicist must be available on-site for unannounced inspections by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and the NHPP on a short notice.
5.	The physicist will complete acceptance testing of the Treatment Planning System (10 CFR 35.457) to meet the American College of Radiology (ACR) requirements.  A copy will be provided to the RSO.
6.	The Physicist will complete quality assurance requirements for all other brachytherapy procedures, such as eye plaques and lung implants to meet the American College of Radiology (ACR) standards.  A copy will be provided to the RSO.

Also, a sign-in and sign-out sheet will be kept by the COTR.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought for Certified 8a Program Participant, SBA Certified HUB Zone Firm, SBA Certified Small Disadvantaged Business, Veteran Owned Business, or Woman Owned Small Businesses only.
<p>Please respond with your corporate capabilities and any other relevant information that would allow USDA to determine your ability to perform the following type of requirement.</p>
<p>1 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers and manages farm commodity, credit, conservation, disaster, and loan programs as authorized by Congress through a network of federal, state, and county offices. FSA's administrative and programmatic functions are supported by a large network of automated systems that are maintained by its Information Technology Services Division (ITSD). ITSD is also responsible for developing new programs, replacing existing programs, and modernizing existing platforms and systems. The primary ITSD operations are located in Washington, DC and Kansas City, MO, with additional offices in St. Louis, MO.<br /><br />The application maintained under this Performance Work Statement (PWS) is the Tobacco Assessment and Payment System (TAPS), which is made up of two major applications--Tobacco transition Payment Program (TTPP) and the Tobacco Transition Assessment Project (TTAP).</p>
<p>TTAP provides a mechanism by which the Government can assess the Tobacco Manufacturers and Importers of tobacco per Title VI, the "Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act" (FETRA) of the American Jobs Creation Action of 2004 (Pub. L. 108-357) that repealed the tobacco marketing quota and related price support programs, and provided for payments to persons who, during a certain period or at a certain time, had been the owners of farms with tobacco quotas or had produced regulated tobacco. FETRA is funded using assessments collected from tobacco product manufacturers and importers.</p>
<p>Under FETRA, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) sends out quarterly notices to tobacco manufacturers and importers, informing those entities of the assessments due to CCC.</p>
<p>TTPP makes payments to tobacco quota holders and producers. The legislation also ends all aspects of the Federal tobacco marketing quota and price support loan programs effective with the 2005 crop year. Requirements for tobacco marketing quota and price support loan programs for the 2004 marketing year remained in effect through the end of the marketing season. The 2004 marketing year ended on 6/30/05 for flue-cured tobacco and all other tobaccos ended on 9/30/05. The payments are made in 10 equal annual installments that began in 2005 and will end in 2014.<br /><br />The Government's ultimate objective under this program is to provide TAPS Maintenance, Functionality, Reporting, and Enhancement in order to ensure the user's needs are met and that standards and regulatory requirements are achieved.</p>
<p>This system is required to:</p>
<p>&bull; support FSA's efforts to deliver new software applications in the web environment;<br />&bull; support a move toward customer centric systems;<br />&bull; interface with the required applications, resolving material weaknesses;<br />&bull; improve project planning, reporting and communication among stakeholders by supporting the Integrated Management System initiative;<br />&bull; facilitate data entry accuracy and field operations;<br />&bull; generate standardized reports; <br />&bull; improve adherence to Style Guide standards and Section 508 compliance; and<br />&bull; allow for all necessary audit functionality and increased data sharing with our partner agencies.</p>
<p>2 SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this effort would be to acquire information technology support services for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) FSA Tobacco Assessment and Payment System. The support services would include TAPS Maintenance, Functionality, Reporting, and Enhancement.</p>

<p><strong>NAICS CODE: 532411</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The USDA Forest Service is contemplating an upgrade of its aerial supervision fleet of airplanes utilized for initial attack, extended attack, and lead plane functions on wildfires. The purpose of this request for information is to conduct market research to determine if there are commercial airplanes (with or without modifications) available in the marketplace to fulfill the aerial supervision module performance requirements within reasonable pricing parameters, which may ultimately result in the issuance of a solicitation of competitive proposals for the dry lease of approximately 10 airplanes (with a possible increase of up to 20 airplanes), of the same model from a single vendor. The airplanes will be operated by Government employee pilots and fuel for the airplanes will be purchased by the Government. The airplanes will be maintained by the contractor/vendor. <br /><br /><strong>The following is a list of the basic minimum requirements needed for aerial platforms to fulfill the aerial supervision mission:</strong></p>
<p>- Airplanes must be turbine powered.<br />- Must be equipped with basic Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) equipment as defined by the FAA.<br />- Minimum flight endurance is 4 hours.<br />- Single or Multi-engine.<br />- Certified for Single Pilot by the FAA.<br />- Dual controls.<br />- Avionics: The airplanes must be capable of having the following standard avionics included in the airplanes: Glide Slope/Localizer, Two VHF-AM 760 Channel Communication/Navigation radios, Low Frequency Receiver, Transponder, IFR Approach Certified Global Positioning System, IFR Certified Autopilot, VHF-AM, Three Audio Selection Panels, Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), Terrain Advisory and Warning System (TAWS), Collision Avoidance System, and Cockpit Voice Recorder. <br />- The ability to add visibility enhancements to make the airplanes highly visible from ground to air and air to air (i.e., color and/or high intensity lighting).<br />- Air Conditioning.<br />- Demonstrated ability to deal with particulates/smoke found in the air environment over fires.<br />- Certificated by the FAA to operate in known icing conditions and to operate in <br />day and night Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).<br />- Meet the Federal Acquisition Act implementation of the Buy American Act and its exceptions for Government acquisition of airplanes.<br />- Airplanes must be in current production or nearing current production; or if not in current production, a minimum of 400 airplanes must have been produced with a production of date not in excess of ten (10) years from the date of the potential date of a new ASM contract award and with no more than 2,000 total airframe time.<br />- Airplanes must have been completely built by the manufacturer, i.e., no kit airplanes.<br />- Minimum Flight Deck capacity of two.<br />- Minimum cruise speed of 230 Knots True Airspeed (KTAS).<br />- Minimum maneuvering speed (Va) of 150 Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS).<br />- Maximum stall speed (Vso) of 90 KIAS.<br />- Minimum Single Engine Service Ceiling of 12,500 ft. msl.</p>
<p>The airplanes have the potential to be operated at altitudes less than 500 feet above ground level, in mountainous terrain, with the normal turbulence associated with the wildfire environment.</p>
<p>Interested parties wishing to participate in this market research may provide relative information and/or brochures for airplanes that meet or exceed the above mission requirements to the following address, by May 18, 2011:</p>

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research, Warfighter Performance S&amp;T Department, Warfighter Protection &amp; Application Division, is conducting a market survey to determine industry capabilities in providing enhancements to medical ultrasound technology. There is also interest in training modules for medical ultrasound usage, especially with focus on applications in trauma care. Medical ultrasound is the primary imaging capability operated by expeditionary naval medical personnel (corpsmen, nurses, physicians) who operate primarily at Role 1 &amp; 2 medical treatment facilities (e.g., Shock Trauma Platoons, Forward Resuscitative Surgical Systems or Expeditionary Resuscitative Surgical Systems). Firms should also provide business size information.
<p>ONR interest is for a portable 3D/4D ultrasound (US) device for abdominal Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST), vascular, and cardiac exams. ONR has additional interest in enhancements to US to provide transcranial imaging for the detection and monitoring of traumatic brain injuries, including detection of foreign bodies (bullets/shrapnel/bone fragments), injury related vascular abnormalities (stenoses/aneurysms/bleeding), severe edema (anatomically distorting and/or indicative of increased intracranial pressure); improved sensitivity in assessing penetrating eye trauma and localization of foreign bodies in soft tissues (to include any materials that might be driven into tissue exposed to violent explosions: shrapnel, bone, clothing, debris); means to identify site of internal bleeding (arterial as well as low flow venous bleeding); and presence of chest/lung injuries (eg. pneumo/hemothorax, parenchymal consolidation, vascular/airway injuries).</p>
<p>In addition, development of medical ultrasound usage training modules is desired. These may take the form of electronic (computer-based) training modules appropriate for both local and distributed training. The training modules could range from traditional classroom-based, instructor/expert taught lessons to distributed training modules appropriate for use in non-classroom, remote locations without necessitating onsite instructor/expert and use of animal/human examination subjects. Inclusion of remote or tele-teaching methods is not necessary but is of interest. Training modules should allow staged learning with progressive complexity and difficulty of interpretation. Methods to estimate or measure success of training including transference of skills from training module to clinical application will be desired.</p>
<p>Training modules are desired for the following topics:<br />Vascular imaging, including detection and estimation of severity/rate of internal bleeding (intracranial/thorax/abdomen)<br />Pneumo/Hemothorax/other lung injury (airway/vasculature/perfusates) recognition<br />Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (Fast Exam) (including pericardial)<br />Foreign body in eyes (e.g., fragments from explosions)<br />Foreign body in soft tissues<br />Bone fracture recognition<br />Detection of ectopic pregnancies and introduction to gyn/obs examinations</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) from U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) and Army Forces Strategic Command (ARSTRAT).  USASMDC/ARSTRAT is seeking information on commercial products available for direct downlinking of data from WorldView-1, WorldView-2, IKONOS GeoEye-1 and GeoEye-2.  The Commercial Data Providers (CDPs) listed above will accept all orders placed by NGA on behalf of USASMDC/ARSTRAT, using the terms of the existing NGA EnhancedView contract.  The CDPs will process the order for delivery upon acceptance of the NGA order.  USASMDC/ARSTRAT may desire the capability to receive all Service Level Agreement (SLA)-licensed imagery data from the CDPs for a "bounded area of interest" as it is collected.  This imagery requirement likewise will be submitted through NGA.  The DDL system will provide receipt, ingest, and processing functions required to process raw, compressed Commercial Imagery data delivered from the WorldView-1, WorldView-2, IKONOS and GeoEye-1 sensors.  The DDL antenna will be capable of receiving imagery downloads from WorldView-1, WorldView-2, IKONOS, GeoEye-1 and GeoEye-2 sensors within a 2,200km radius of the DDL location.  The DDL antenna will be capable of receiving an 800 Mbps X-band downlink stream, which requires a dual-polarization antenna configuration.  Antenna should be modular, portable and meet military standards for air/rail transport. Roll-On/Roll-Off capability desired.  The DDL antenna control unit (ACU) will enable the collection of imagery from WorldView-1, WorldView-2, IKONOS, GeoEye-1, and GeoEye-2 sensors in the most efficient manner.  Based on information provided by the vendor the ACU will develop and execute an imagery acquisition download plan.  The ACU should keep footprint size to a minimum, keeping rack space to a minimum.  Should an ACU require more than one standard rack of space, options should address how the ACU can be utilized as a separately powered, environmentally controlled unit for DDL operation.  Please specify rack requirements for ACU's.  The DDL system processors will be capable of ingesting imagery from WorldView-1, WorldView-2, IKONOS, GeoEye-1, and GeoEye-2 sensors.  The processors will be able to process a set of products in the DDL system, using the Commercial Imagery Vendor/Provider Image Plan, from acquired Level 0 imagery data to one or more pre-defined processing levels for the Commercial Imagery Mission.  The processor will have the capability to support the creation of imagery products from the CDPs in the following formats: GeoTiff, NITF 2.0/2.1 and JPEG 2000.  The DDL system will include an intuitive Windows-based user interface application with which to manage the processing engine and end to end workflow.  The DDL system will include a technical support package, including a PLL recommendation for consideration, from the contractor.  On demand, technical support can be proposed at the 8 hour by 5 day (during regular business hours) for tracking and correction of software defects, software patches and updates (as required), and hardware support.  The DDL system will not exceed two standard equipment racks. This is inclusive of any workstation computers, the primary Antenna Control Unit (ACU) and all associated ground station equipment needed to operate the DDL.  Please provide a technical description of your company's product(s) to include current demonstrable features. Also discuss in detail inherent capabilities which enhance system accuracy, speed performance, and operator ease of use.  Identify which features are included with the basic system capability as opposed to those features which may be optionally offered. In your response please address whether the following desired features and capabilities are currently supported:  Responses should clearly state terms and conditions of sale to include required end user licensing and/or applicable service agreements. Describe available options for training, maintenance, and contractor logistics support along with the specific terms and conditions associated with each. Indicate whether resulting support agreements allow for operations or maintenance by a third party.  Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) price estimates are requested for the basic system(s) capability, along with individually priced estimates associated with any of the optional capabilities described.  Also provide delivery schedule information for the basic and optional capabilities offered. Please provide ROM estimates for each support option offered.  Finally, indicate the provisions of any warranty offered as well as, the costs associated with extending such warranty.  Proprietary information is not being solicited, however, if it is submitted it should be appropriately marked.  This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend pay for the information requested.  Point of contact is George Knowlton, Contracting Officer, ATTN:  SMDC-RDC-C.  Capability responses and inquiries will only be accepted electronically by email at: george.knowlton@smdc-cs.army.mil.

<DESC>This synopsis is notification of the Fort Sill Contracting Office's intent to award an interim bridge contract to extend the services of the current Electronic Warfare (EW) contract, for a base period of performance beginning 20 July 2011 - 24 April 2011 plus three 1-month option periods.  A competitive task order was awarded to Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems, 100 Sun Ave NE, Ste 300, Albuquerque, NM  87109-4660. The interim contract will be performed under the same terms and conditions of the existing contract, DABK01-03-D-0008-1L04, which was competitively awarded at MICC Center-Fort Eustis, Virginia, and will expire on 19 July 2011. This will be an unrestricted sole source procurement. The bridge contract will be issued to the current contractor, Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems, 100 Sun Ave NE, Ste 300, Albuquerque, NM  87109-4660.  The contract type is a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  This bridge contract will provide critical services to the USAFCOEFS .  This action is accomplished under authority cited in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement requires mandatory instructor certifications to be held prior to teaching this course.  Certifications normally take up to 150 days to obtain for the EW Course.  Due to time constraints there is not enough time to provide Fair Opportunity to the FCoE contractors per guidance in following the task order competitive procedures which would allow a new contractor a phase-in period for non-certified instructors to obtain certification.  Award to any other source would result in a lapse in service which would result in mission failure. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and is posted for five (5) calendar days.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this base seven month period plus five one-month option periods would be advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be issued without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this contract is based on this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code remains 611430.   Any comments or questions to this notice, or detailed capabilities must be emailed to Deidra Zerzavy:  deidra.zerzavy@us.army.mil or Karen Warner:  karen.l.warner@us.army.mil, at the Mission Installation Contracting Command, Fort Sill Contracting Office.<br><br><br><br>

<DESC>This proposed contract action is for a service in which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source, the University of Rochester Medical Center, Dr. Deborah A. King, PhD., under the authority Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (a)(2) only one responsible source, 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1).    The requirement is for submission of an application for approval of a VA Special Fellowship in Advanced Psychiatry and Psychology; the following need to be identified:
VISN, facility and program commitment to build and sustain an outstanding learning environment;
Physician and associated health fellowship program directors and faculty with strong records in mental health research, education, clinical care and leadership;
Research resources including a strong research track record;
Educational resources including a strong, constructive partnership with the affiliate; and Advanced clinical learning opportunities with excellent mentoring and sound clinical infrastructure plans.
The primary goal of the VA Special Fellowship in Advanced Psychiatry and Psychology is to develop outstanding academic and/or healthcare system leaders who will lead mental health research in the 21st century and effectively translate their research findings into clinical practice and educational activities.  This goal is to be achieved by providing Fellows with state-of-the-art training in mental health research, cutting edge educational experiences, and advanced clinical training.  
Dr. Deborah A. King will be working toward the development of a VA Special Fellowship in Advanced Psychiatry and Psychology for the VISN 2 Center of Excellence (CoE) for Suicide Prevention.  To accomplish this, she will identify collaborators both within VA and at our university affiliate, the University of Rochester, who will partner together for an application for a VA Special Fellowship program.
Dr. Deborah A. King is a faculty member in the VISN 2 Center of Excellence (CoE) for Suicide Prevention academic affiliate, the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester Medical School.  She has over 15 years of experience with developing training fellowship programs and supervising psychology fellows.  Dr. King also has worked for the last four years as an IPA with the Center of Excellence's Education, Training, and Dissemination Core.   Given Dr. King's unique position of being on faculty with the Center's academic affiliate and her experience with the VISN 2 Center of Excellence for Suicide Prevention since its inception, Dr. King is uniquely qualified to determine the feasibility of developing a VA Special Fellowship in Advanced Psychiatry and Psychology.   She will be able to work with key individuals in both settings to bring about the integration that will be required to develop a successful application to VA.  There is currently no other individual who can integrate both these critical settings to build a compelling fellowship program.

This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all information received by 10:00 a.m. EST on June 22, 2011 will considered by the Government.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities to the requirement via email.

PURPOSE

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research and obtain information regarding potential solutions to replace the existing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) non-contact center telephone services with an Enterprise Voice over IP (VoIP) and Unified Communications solution that results in convergence of the network and voice infrastructure, as well as convergence of the user experience.  The converged solution will provide all required functions and features outlined in the attached Configuration, Technical and Functional Requirements document, and will put the IRS in a position to reap the future benefits of Internet Protocol (IP) enabled technology.  Further, this RFI will help to identify possible new or alternative solutions available in the marketplace which will introduce additional features and lower total cost of ownership. 

Responses to this RFI will be used to accomplish the following:

  Collect industry input on the attached Configuration, Technical and Functional requirements
  Gain insight into vendor designs supporting the attached requirements
  Identify alternative designs that provide added value to the IRS


TERMS

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes, and does not constitute a solicitation or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Should the IRS issue a solicitation, the IRS may consider using the Connections II, Alliant or NASA SEWP IV contract if appropriate, and if Connections II is awarded in time.

REQUESTED INFORMATION

At this time the IRS is finalizing the configuration, design, technical and functional requirements for this project.  The attachment to this notice contains the current draft of these elements.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief,<br />that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible<br />for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a<br />civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with<br />obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract;<br />violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of<br />embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax<br />evasion, violating criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a<br />Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause;<br />and<br />(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent<br />Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been<br />assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial<br />Page 17 of 20<br />Request for Quotation FA8100-11-Q-0036<br />challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally<br />determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer<br />has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is<br />not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. section 6212,<br />which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is<br />not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax<br />Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial<br />appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability,<br />and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. section 6320 entitling the taxpayer<br />to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further<br />appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the<br />hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer<br />has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it<br />is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final<br />tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. section<br />6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the<br />agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently<br />required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent<br />because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. section 362 (the Bankruptcy<br />Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The<br />Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (j)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are<br />included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor; unless<br />excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />_______________ __________________<br />_______________ __________________<br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of<br />child labor.<br />(j) Place of Manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured<br />end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end<br />products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--<br />(1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products<br />manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured<br />outside the United States); or<br />(2) [ ] Outside the United States.<br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as<br />to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it<br />subcontracts out the exempt services.)<br />(1) [ ] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as 4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not<br />Page 18 of 20<br />Request for Quotation FA8100-11-Q-0036<br />certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than<br />Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an<br />exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business<br />operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or<br />market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such<br />equipment; and<br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work<br />under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees<br />servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br />(2) [ ] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to<br />provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to<br />comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26<br />U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service<br />(IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of<br />the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

Basis for Award

Selection of a quote for award will be based on an evaluation of quotes in the areas of Technical and Price, with award being made to the quoter whose quote is the lowest priced and is technically acceptable. Under this evaluation approach, a quoter would not receive any additional credit for exceeding the established minimum defined requirements of technical acceptability. 
The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award one purchase order without discussions with quoters. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. 
Evaluation Factors & Evaluation Approach 
Careful, impartial, and full consideration will be given to all quotes received pursuant to the Request for Quotation and evaluations will be applied in a similar manner. Factors against which quotes will be evaluated are set forth below. Each quote received will be evaluated by key Government personnel knowledgeable in the respective fields. 
Factor 1-Technical Capability 
The quoters technical portion of the quote will be rated acceptable or unacceptable based on assessment of the stated minimum requirements below. These items are deemed critical to meet the Governments requirement. If any one of these requirements is rated as unacceptable this will result in an overall technical rating of unacceptable and the quote will not be considered any further. 
Quoters must submit a quote that meets the following technical requirements, as described in the Statement of Work: 
a) Extensometer  single unit Poissons ratio biaxial 
b) Adapter cables from extensometer to the strain input 
c) Test Works  4  EM Test Systems N- R- K Method Package Software 
d) Environmental Chamber 
e) LN2 Hose Kit 
f) Compression cage 
g) Installation and training 
h) Programmable Oven Control 
i) Load Train Port 
j) Extensometer rod kit 
Factor 2 - Price

Price Inconsistencies: A quote is presumed to represent a quoters best effort to respond to the solicitation. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between promised performance and price, shall be explained in the quote. Any significant inconsistencies, if unexplained, raise a fundamental issue of the quoters understanding of the nature and scope or the work required and their financial ability to perform the contract, and may be grounds for rejection of the quote. 
Provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications- Commercial Items shall be completed by quoters and submitted with quotes; OR indicate that your companys representations and certifications are current and available via Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

INTRODUCTION:Under the provisions of P.L. 107-110 "No Child Left Behind" (NCLB) and the Memorandum of Agreement with the U.S. Department of Education the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) is designated as the State Educational Agency (SEA) for 173 instructional and residential programs in 23 states that receive funding under NCLB.  The BIE provides oversight and supervision for schools that are funded under P.L. 95-561 that are operated by the BIE and for tribally operated schools that are funded under the provisions of P.L. 100-297 and P.L. 93-638 that receive funding under NCLB.  100% of the students that attend BIE operated and funded programs meet the criterion for being socially and economically disadvantaged which qualifies these schools to receive funding under NCLB.As the SEA for these schools the BIE assumes the responsibility for the appropriate use of funds and that school meet the accountability requirements and adhere to the process for determining Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for the respective state the school is located in.   2.   BACKGROUND:The centerpiece of NCLB is the determination of whether schools have made AYP on a series of academic indicators. NCLB also allows for the development of alternative definitions for measuring AYP. 25 CFR Subpart A ?? 30.100-110 and Subpart B ?? 30.114-115 codifies the results of Negotiated Rulemaking, the process of consultation with Indian tribes, concerning the implementation of ESEA by the BIE. Negotiated Rulemaking determined that the BIE shall use the accountability system of the state in which a BIE-funded school resides for determining whether the school has made AYP. Further, Negotiated Rulemaking delineated the BIE's responsibility in providing technical assistance to schools surrounding accountability generally, in terms of informing schools how AYP is calculated, and the development of alternate definitions of AYP in particular. 25 CFR Subpart D as well as 20 USC 6316(g)(5) outline the reporting requirements surrounding accountability in education that must be met by the BIE. Furthermore, the US Department of the Interior and the Office of Management and Budget regularly require reports of data concerned with accountability that is deemed accurate, reliable, and reflective of the standards by which AYP is determined.3.   SCOPEBIE must comply with the accountability requirements of P.L. 107-110 "No Child Left Behind" and requires the assistance of a contractor to perform professional services that support BIE funded schools and tribal entities with analysis and comprehension of accountability data and Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). The contractor shall support BIE funded schools and tribal entities with AYP calculation, tracking, and advisement; as well as advisory services inclusive of Alternative AYP Definition development, and services that are valuable in helping alternate definitions of AYP meet successfully with peer review as stipulated by NCLB. 4.   CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIESThe contractor is responsible for furnishing all equipment, connectivity, supplies, travel, transportation of goods or equipments, or additional professional services needed to carry out the requirements of the solicitation.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items in conjunction with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ), Solicitation Number SP3300-11-Q-0127.
<p>This notice incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-50 effective 16 May 2011, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARs) DPN 20110518 edition effective 18 May 2011, and the Defense Logistics Agency Directive (DLAD) current to Revision 5 and PROCLT 2011-12. The complete text of any of the clauses and provisions may be accessed in full text at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/</p>
<p>This acquisition is a total 100% Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside among certified resellers of Enterasys equipment. The associated NAICS code is 334210, and the associated small business size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>DLA Distribution has a requirement for the enclosed Enterasys brand name equipment. <br />See the attached schedule of supplies/services for Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) identification. Part Numbers shown in the schedule of supplies/services are Enterasys Part Numbers. Delivery is required no later than two (2) weeks after contract award.</p>
<p>Delivery is required to the following address: <br />DLA Information Operations New Cumberland<br />Building 54-2, Door 8, M Avenue<br />New Cumberland, PA 17070</p>
<p>Offeror must be a certified reseller or agent of the manufacturer for the products requested. All products and components must be manufacturer new, sourced directly from the manufacturer or via an authorized distributor, and must include the manufacturer's full hardware and/or software warranty. No third party, refurbished, or gray market items will be accepted. All products must be supportable via the manufacturer's extended support contracts without recertification by the manufacturer. All licenses, warranties, and extended support contracts must convey to the Federal Government. <br /><br />BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION<br />This requirement includes with the solicitation the enclosed brand name justification in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(c):</p>
<p>DLA Information Operations New Cumberland utilizes Enterasys brand name hardware for all of the switching needs of the organization. Enterasys is the actual manufacturer of the network equipment which is proprietary in nature. As such, Enterasys maintains exclusive rights to all products and services. In addition, maintenance support of the Enterasys brand name equipment must be performed either by Enterasys or an Enterasys Authorized Support Partner. It is essential that the Enterasys products be utilized to provide for proper maintenance of the systems. Selection of any other hardware/software would deviate from the equipment standards used within DLA Information Operations New Cumberland. Deviation from this solution would invalidate our security posture. To date, DLA Information Operations New Cumberland has not found any other vendor that has the capability to integrate itself with this proprietary solution.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price purchase order resulting from this notice. Any award resulting from this solicitation will be issued on a Standard Form (SF) 1449.</p>
<p>The method of payment for supplies/services under this contract will be by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).</p>

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<BR><BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products.<BR><BR>(2) Certification.

The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.<BR><BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).

<p>***The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase a Photon Counting X-Ray Area Detector.</p>
<p><br />****All interested Contractor's shall provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p><br />Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Photon Counting X-Ray Area Detector. The system must meet or exceed all of the minimum specifications identified herein. All equipment must be new. Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>The system must consist of all the following components:</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The X-ray Metrology Project within the Ceramics Division produces Standard Reference Materials used throughout the world to calibrate X-ray diffraction instrumentation. A photon counting X-ray area detector optimized for measuring Cu Kalpha characteristic radiation (8.04 keV) with linear response over a high dynamic range, no background, low heat output, and high-temporal stability. This detector will be used to observe scattered X-ray in lattice determination of Powder Diffraction SRMs and in the spectra characterization of our diffraction optics. The area detector is essential for reducing uncertainties in our wavelength calibration on several instruments in our X-ray metrology facility located in the Advanced Measurements Laboratory.</p>
<p>Photon Counting X-Ray Area Detector Specifications:</p>
<p>1) True photon counting capability. An integrating/analog detector is not acceptable. For X-ray metrology traceability, the system must provide actual number of photons scattered from a sample and compare these values in an absolute context. <br />2) Dimensions (active area of detector): greater than or equal to 25 mm X 75 mm. The detector must be able to measure this entire range of translation. <br />3) Pixel Dimensions: less than or equal to 250 um X 250 um)<br />4) Point Spread Function: less than or equal to 250 um X 250 um <br />5) Photon efficiency for Cu characteristic radiation: greater than or equal to 75% of the incident photons<br />6) Background counts / pixel / second: less than 0.001 X-ray photons / pixel / second<br />7) Detector linearity: Must be better than 1% at count rate greater than500,000 X-ray photons / feature<br />8) Stable counting statistics: Poisson counting noise with a constant (or zero) detector background. Note that the detector background should NOT be a function of count rate. <br />9) Detector physical specifications: Detector must be less than 25kg and be free of all but flexible cables (no continuous-flow liquid nitrogen inputs must be required during detector operation).<br />Installation will be completed by NIST Technical experts using custom installation procedures. Training and installation is not required by the Contractor.</p>
<p>Inspection and Final Acceptance Criteria</p>
<p>In addition to the inspection and acceptance terms articulated in 52.212-4, the Government reserves the right to perform such performance tests and evaluations as defined below to verify specified system performance. Such tests and evaluations, if performed, shall be conducted within the environment that the system is to be operated. The Contractor has the right to be present during the tests and evaluations, if performed, at the Contractor's expense.</p>
<p>Performance Test/Acceptance Tests</p>
<p>Performance testing of the detector will be performed within the first 30 days of receipt of the detector. A Si (220) high-resolution diffraction feature produced using Cu Kalpha radiation in a double crystal diffraction configuration will be used to validate the detector specifications 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8. A point source will be used to validate 3 and 4. <br />Packaging/Marking: <br />Detector must be shipped in a special case/enclosure intended for long-term storage of the X-ray detector when not in use. The detector casing must be externally marked with reference points indicating the position of the active detector plane within the housing.<br />***The Contractor shall provide a minimum one (1) year warranty on all components. All costs including parts, labor, shipping, and other expenses necessary to repair any machine equipment will be borne solely by the contractor at no additional cost to the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>**Delivery shall be provided not later than 4 months after receipt of an order. Delivery shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. ***</p>
<p><br />Award shall be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement", 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. Technical capability and past performance, when combined, shall be approximately equal to price. If Technical Capability and Past Performance are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor.</p>
<p>Technical Capability:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. Quoters shall also include product literature which addresses all specifications &amp; clearly documents that the product offered meets or exceeds the specifications identified herein.<br />Note: If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain technical requirement, NIST will determine that it does not.</p>
<p>Stronger Consideration shall be given to the vendor that can provide the following:</p>
<p>Energy resolution and rejection capability for photons +/- 1keV for a set photon energy would be an additional criteria of interest.</p>
<p>Past Performance</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product &amp; service provided and the Contractor's history of meeting delivery schedules for prior deliverables. Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or the quoters recent and relevant procurement history with NIST or its' affiliates. Offerors should provide a list of 3-5 references to whom the same or similar equipment has been provided.</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable in accordance with the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health intens to procure hardware and software maintenance and support for a period of one year, with a possible one year option.

Background

The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.

The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by bridges. The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics. The new 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals. The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA) on behalf of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Applied Scientific Instrumentation, Inc., 29391 West Enid Rd., Eugene, OR 97402 to provide custom mechanical design and integration component parts for microscopy in constructing a new kind of selective plane illumination microscope that will involve dual excitation and dual detection with two cameras.
<p><br />Applied Scientific Instrumentation, Inc. is the only vendor that can provide the necessary mechanical parts and the electronics to synch all components together with pre-existing cameras, lasers, and objectives. The use of their custom designed frame and mechanical stage is necessary in order to fit all pre-existing pieces of the microscope together. The sole source determination is based on the fact that there is currently no commercial microscope frame that can support this hardware functionality, thus supporting the determination to make a sole source award to Applied Scientific Instrumentation, Inc.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) is contemplating the award of a five (5) year Priced Requirements Contract for the procurement of Aircraft Windshield Panels in support of the H-53 platform.  Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government.  The following three (3) items are contemplated for award: 

1. WINDSHIELD PANEL, NIIN: 014853953, P/N (1): P00201-1, P/N (2): 65206-01003-113
2. WINDSHIELD PANEL, NIIN: 014853954, P/N (1): P00201-2, P/N (2): 65206-01003-114
3. WINDSHIELD PANEL, NIIN: 014853955, P/N (1): P00200-1, P/N (2): 65206-01009-106

These items require Government Source Approval prior to award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.
 Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items has been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source, you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVICP Source Approval Brochure which can be obtained on the internet at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps. 
Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the source approval brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of this requirement may be continued based on Fleet support needs.
All contractual documents (i.e.
 contracts, purchase orders, task orders, delivery orders and modifications) related to the instant procurement are considered to be "issued" by the Government when copies are either deposited in the mail, transmitted by facsimile, or sent by other electronic commerce methods, such as email. The Governments acceptance of the contractorâs proposal constitutes bilateral agreement to "issue" contractual documents as detailed herein.

<DESC>HOTEL, DINING, AND AUDIO/VISUAL EVENT PRODUCTION<br />SBA 2011 Field Management Conference<br />PROPOSED DATES ARE FIRM FOR THE PERIOD SUNDAY, JULY 17, 2011 THROUGH FRIDAY, JULY 22, 2011
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. The NAICS is 721110 and the Small Business Size Standard is $30.0 million.</p>
<p>A. IDENTIFICATION<br />The Small Business Administration, Field Operations Headquarters intends to block single occupancy sleeping rooms, meeting space, meals, and audio/visual (A/V) event production services for general session presentations for SBA's District Directors, Regional Administrators and supervisors and senior leaders from headquarters.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVES<br />The long-term strength of our agency is critically linked to our ability to align our program or individual office goals with the strategic goals of the SBA. For an organization of our size, our managers and frontline leaders must work in concert and not cross-purposes. We've already begun this process by having our frontline leaders work collaboratively with their program department counterparts to identify critical skills and develop training materials that are relevant for both sides. We'd like to build on that momentum by utilizing our time in Tampa/St. Petersburg, Florida to gain a shared understanding of SBA's strategic plan and how our 2012 district office and program department goals will be informed by the plan.</p>
<p>The goals of the conference are:</p>
<p>1. To identify, share and begin to implement customer service best practices across the agency.<br />2. To examine and identify the customer and partner experience with the agency's programs and services.<br />3. Identify ways to strengthen our customer service while managing performance across all of our field management units.</p>
<p>C. BACKGROUND<br />The SBA Field Management Conference is aimed at SBA's District Directors, Regional Administrators and supervisors and senior leaders from headquarters. The conference will consist of a series of lectures, presentations, training sessions, interactive breakout sessions, and sharing of ideas, best practices and lessons learned.</p>
<p>A small preparatory group will arrive on Sunday, July 17th. They will need to have a pre-conference meeting with the facility staff and a tour of the facility on the morning of Monday, July 18th. The remaining large contingent of the conference attendees will arrive throughout the day of Monday, July 18th. Attendees will be arriving from the entire United States.</p>
<p>Hotel staff will have conference rooms and all hotel provided equipment setup no later than 7:00 am each morning of the training event as agreed upon by the hotel and SBA's on-site representative. This includes any hotel provided audio-visual equipment.</p>
<p>On the first day of the training event, the hotel's audio-visual technician will be available from 7:00 am to 9:00 am to assist SBA's presenters with their personal audio-visual equipment setup. Actual start time may change based on final training schedule. SBA's on-site representative will confirm actual day and time audio-visual technician is needed. On-site technical support expertise in audio-visual equipment setup and trouble-shooting necessary to resolve routine audio-visual malfunctions is required. Daily, during the hours of 8:00 am and 5:00 pm, hotel's audio-visual staff must be available to provide technical support within 30 minutes of the hotel being notified by SBA's presenters or on-site representative.</p>
<p>SBA's lead contact and on-site representative for all training events is Ms. Susan Nassaux, Field Operations Specialist. Ms. Nassaux may provide additional SBA on-site representatives who may be serving as alternate Agency on-site representatives for specific training events during the performance period.</p>
<p>D. HOTEL LOCATION, QUALITY AND ACCOMMODATIONS<br />The conference space will be used as a training classroom. This will require one large banquet room with unobstructed interior views large enough for various training room configurations/setups (classroom, U-shape, circles, etc) to comfortably accommodate approximately 150 participants. Likewise, SBA may need four smaller work rooms to comfortably accommodate approximately 15-20 participants. At a minimum, all rooms must be Internet accessible and may require standard audio-visual presentation equipment (LCD projectors, microphones/lavalieres, projector screen (or 60" or larger LED/LCD/HD TV screen), connection cables, power cords) technical support and setup available for training presenters. Conference rooms and audio-visual equipment must be reserved solely for SBA for the duration of the event.</p>
<p>In order to meet SBA requirements, all conference and meeting spaces must be contiguous or in very close proximity (line of sight preferred) to each other. The banquet room space, where the General Sessions will be held will be the main focus of the conference; therefore, the space shall be visually appealing. The banquet rooms space shall comfortably accommodate up to 150 adults. The four meeting rooms shall be required to comfortably accommodate 20 adults for smaller work-related meetings. All program space must be blocked for the sole use of SBA for the duration of the conference. Spaces shall be clean, well ventilated, well lit, adequately soundproofed and handicapped accessible.</p>
<p>Guest rooms will be individually occupied. All must have flat screen TVs, included Internet access, and be contemporary, handicapped accessible, and able to offer refrigerators upon request. Guest rooms must be provided at a rate at or below the Government approved rate of $92/night. A list of attendees will be provided at the time of contract award to create the reservations. The entire event including guest rooms will be contracted and invoiced against as a single contract. Attendees will furnish a credit card at check-in for incidentals and personal expenses only.

<p>The hotel shall guarantee SBA participants' guest room reservations and rates for five business days prior to scheduled event.</p>
<p>Due to the Agency's mission to be able to provide immediate support to America's small business community on a moment's notice, SBA requires flexibility in its ability to change the number of participants' guest rooms reserved. SBA will guarantee 85% occupancy rate of its participants' guest room without penalty.</p>

<p>A hotel airport shuttle service is preferred; however if no shuttle service is provided, the hotel will provide information on other airport transportation options.</p>

Employees' meal per diem allowance will be reduced for all government provided meals. All meals/food/beverage costs are not to exceed the federal governments' Denver per diem rates ($8-$10 - breakfast, $12-$15 - lunch) per day excluding service charges. Meals will be served (either buffet style or plated) at predetermined times as during normal meal hours as agreed upon by the hotel and SBA's on-site representative. SBA's training schedule will indicate planned meal hours. SBA's on-site representative will confirm meal plan hour with hotel's representative at least one week prior to training start date.

SBA may require the front desk to hand out an informational welcome flyer to the attendees upon check-in. Express check-out via guestroom TV or under guestroom door invoicing is desired.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, hotel will provide SBA's on-site representatives a telephone directory of "key" hotel personnel assigned to supporting SBA during the conference. The telephone directory must include "key" personnel's business hours and telephone numbers (note a telephone answering service is not acceptable). At a minimum, the key personnel must be identified for check-in/out, guest room accommodations, audio-visual support, meal services, and conference room setup.</p>
<p>The front desk shall be prepared to provide basic information on the proximity of outside dining establishments as the group will likely be released nightly to enjoy dinner outside of the event facility.</p>

<DESC><strong>Project Number: R16-A<br />Project Title: Communicating Railroad-DOT Mitigation Strategies</strong>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>SHRP 2 Background </strong></p>
<p>To address the challenges of moving people and goods efficiently and safely on the nation's highways, Congress has created the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2). SHRP 2 is a targeted, short-term research program carried out through competitively awarded contracts to qualified researchers in the academic, private, and public sectors. SHRP 2 addresses four strategic focus areas: the role of human behavior in highway safety (Safety); rapid highway renewal (Renewal); congestion reduction through improved travel time reliability (Reliability); and transportation planning that better integrates community, economic, and environmental considerations into new highway capacity (Capacity). Under current legislative provisions, SHRP 2 has expanded its efforts to include activities, such as pilot tests and field demonstrations, that help to prepare research results for implementation.  <br /> <br /> <br /><strong>Renewal Focus Area </strong></p>
<p>The U.S. highway system is aging and must be rebuilt while we are driving on it and living next to it. Research in the SHRP 2 Renewal focus area therefore addresses the need to develop a consistent, systematic approach to completing highway projects quickly, with minimal disruption to the community, and producing facilities that are long-lasting. Identifying new technologies for locating underground utilities; developing procedures to speed the evaluation of designs and the inspection of construction; and applying new methods and materials for preserving, rehabilitating, and reconstructing roadways and bridges are among the goals for this focus area. Alternative strategies for contracting, financing, and managing projects and mitigating institutional barriers also are part of the emphasis on rapid renewal. The renewal scope applies to all classes of roads.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Background</strong></p>
<p>The objective of the completed SHRP 2 Project R16 was to identify and develop strategies and institutional arrangements that could produce cooperative relationships between railroads and public agencies and to develop model agreements.   These model agreements and best practices for coordinating on public highway projects were created as a tool-box that both parties could use through the project delivery cycle.    With the conclusion of the project, there is an immediate need to communicate and pilot-test the findings so as to facilitate their implementation.</p>
<p>Based on the published research report from Project R16 (SHRP 2 Report S2-R16-RR-1 http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/shrp2/SHRP2_S2-R16-RR-1.pdf ), there is a need to establish a joint committee or "community of interest" to share best practices and distribute model processes.  This "community of interest" will ideally capture the interest of the most innovative members of both highway agencies and railroads. This "community of interest" should meet on a regular basis to update model agreement language and communicate successful practices and lessons learned.</p>
<p>The need to find "champion-pairings" of one or more railroads and public agencies willing to successfully pilot test model agreements resulting from Project R16 has also been identified. The research resulting from Project R16 includes examples of individual public agencies and railroads that successfully teamed to expedite the project agreement process, suggesting that this process can be successfully implemented on a broad scale.  Building upon those experiences, SHRP 2 seeks to engage other public agency/railroad pairs to test and improve their project coordination efforts utilizing the findings from Project R16.</p>
<p>In addition to Class I railroads, regional Class II freight railroads should be included in the scope of this project, as these entities are expected to also team with public agencies to implement highway-rail projects.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Objectives</strong><br />&bull;	Create, establish, and maintain a joint committee or "community of interest" to share best practices and distribute model processes.<br />&bull;	Identify and recruit "champion-pairings" (at least one state DOT and one Class I/ II railroad pairing) to apply and pilot test the results of Project R16.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks </strong><br /><em>Task descriptions are intended to provide a framework for conducting the research. SHRP 2 is seeking the insights of proposers on how best to achieve the research objectives.  Proposers are expected to describe research plans that can realistically be accomplished within the constraints of available funds and contract time.  Proposals must present the proposers' current thinking in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the issues and the soundness of their approach to meeting the research objectives.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Identify appropriate stakeholders for membership in the "community of interest."  The "community of interest" should be balanced with respect to geography and organization type, and should include practitioners from Class I and Class II freight railroads, as well as state, local, and federal highway agencies, and other relevant stakeholders.  The "community of interest" recommendations may include multiple levels of membership (e.g., full members, associates). Prepare an interim report summarizing Task 1 and present the report and recommendations to SHRP 2 for review and approval.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Identify, collect and distribute all needed informational material to the "community of interest."</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Plan and hold a kick-off meeting with the selected "community of interest" members and associates.  The contractor for this project must facilitate the development of the charter and direction for the "community of interest."  The meeting format should provide for both in-person and remote participation capabilities. Prepare a set of deliverables including the informational materials distributed for/at the meeting, the meeting minutes and, if applicable, a recording of the meeting in a standard digital format.</p>
<p><strong>Task 4:</strong> Plan and organize follow-up meetings and/or webinars, not less frequently than semiannually.  Meeting format should provide both in-person and remote participation capability. Prepare a meeting report for each follow-up meeting or webinar of the "community of interests" and deliver to SHRP 2.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5:</strong> Identify and recruit "champion-pairings" (at least one state DOT and one Class I/ II railroad pairing) to implement the results of Project R16. Obtain a signed memorandum of understanding ("MOU") to implement master agreement(s) for a major highway/rail project or program (e.g., grade separation, track relocation).</p>
<p><strong>Task 6:</strong> Prepare a case report documenting lessons learned from the "champion-pairings."  The case report must specify the best practices used by the "champion-pairings."  The case report shall be addressed to SHRP 2 and distributed to the "community of interest."</p>
<p><strong>Task 7:</strong> Prepare an implementation plan for long-term sustainability of the "community of interest."</p>
<p><strong>Deliverables </strong></p>
<p>&bull; <em>At the end of Task 1:</em> An Interim Report detailing the results of Task 1 and the recommendations for "community of interest" membership&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; <em>At the end of Task 3:</em> A kick-off meeting report including the informational materials provided for the meeting pursuant to Task 2, presentation materials distributed, approved meeting minutes and a recording of the meeting in a standard digital format (web link acceptable).</p>
<p>&bull; <em>During Task 4:</em> A meeting report for each follow-up meeting or webinar of the "community of interests."  Each report must include the informational and presentation materials distributed at the meeting, approved meeting minutes, and a full recording of each meeting or webinar in a standard digital format (web link acceptable).</p>
<p>&bull; <em>At the end of Task 5:</em> A copy of the signed memorandum of understanding.</p>
<p>&bull; <em>At the end of Task 6:</em> A case report documenting lessons learned from the "champion-pairings" pilot test.</p>
<p>&bull;<em> At the end of Task 7: </em>Implementation plan for long-term sustainability of the "community of interests."</p>
<p>&bull; Monthly progress reports&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Quarterly progress reports&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Two (2) interim meetings with SHRP 2 staff: One (1) in Washington, DC and one (1) at the contractor's facility&nbsp;</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Liability Statement</strong><br /></div>
<p>The signature of an authorized representative of the proposing agency is required on the unaltered statement in order for SHRP 2 to accept the agency's proposal for consideration. P<strong>roposals submitted without this executed and unaltered statement by the proposal deadline <em>will be summarily rejected</em>.</strong> An executed, unaltered statement indicates the agency's intent and ability to execute a contract that includes the provisions in the statement. Here is a printable version of the Liability Statement (http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/shrp2/LiabilityStatement.pdf). A free copy of the Adobe Acrobat PDF reader is available at http://www.adobe.com. The Liability Statement is included as Figure 1 in the <em>Manual for Conducting Research and Preparing Proposals for SHRP 2</em> referred to in General Note 4.</p>
<p><br /><strong>General Notes</strong><br />1. Proposals will be evaluated by SHRP 2 staff and Expert Task Groups (ETGs) consisting of individuals collectively very knowledgeable in the problem area. Selection of an agency is made by the SHRP 2 Oversight Committee, based on the recommendation from SHRP 2 staff and the ETG. The following factors are considered: (1) the proposer's demonstrated understanding of the problem; (2) the merit of the proposed research approach and experimental design; (3) the experience, qualifications, and objectivity of the research team in the same or closely related problem area; (4) the proposer's plan for participation by disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs)-small firms owned and controlled by minorities or women; and (5) the adequacy of facilities. <br /> <br /> TRB and the SHRP 2 Oversight Committee strongly encourage the significant participation of DBEs in SHRP 2 research contracts. Although no quota is specified nor is DBE participation mandated, the proposer's plan for involvement of DBEs is a factor in contractor selection, and the contractor's adherence to its DBE plan will be monitored during the contract period. The Contractor Expression of Interest section of the SHRP 2 website is a resource for proposers interested in participating on research teams. This database is being enhanced and will be renamed the Research Team Builder.</p>
<p>2. Any clarifications regarding this RFP will be posted on the SHRP 2 web site (www.TRB.org/SHRP2). Announcements of such clarifications will be posted on the front page and, when possible, will be noted in the TRB e-newsletter. Proposers are advised to check the web site frequently until July 1, 2011, when no further comments will be posted.</p>
<p>3. According to the provisions of Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 21, which relates to nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs, all parties are hereby notified that the contract entered into pursuant to this announcement will be awarded without discrimination on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or disability.</p>
<p>4. The essential features required in a proposal for research are detailed in the <em>Manual for Conducting Research and Preparing Proposals for SHRP 2</em> (http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/shrp2/PreparingSHRP2Reports.pdf). <strong>Proposals must be prepared according to this document, and attention is directed specifically to Section IV for mandatory requirements. Proposals that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected.</strong></p>
<p>5. The total funds available are made known in the project statement, and line items of the budget are examined to determine the reasonableness of the allocation of funds to the various tasks. If the proposed total cost exceeds the funds available, the proposal is rejected.</p>
<p>6. All proposals become the property of the Transportation Research Board. Final disposition will be made according to the policies thereof, including the right to reject all proposals.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note</strong><br />1. Proposals submitted in response to this RFP must comply with the following special requirements:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The Research Approach section shall be no more than 30 pages, printed double-sided, in type no smaller than 12 point.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. The Credentials section shall be no more than 30 pages.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. The Exhibits section shall be no more than 30 pages.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Potential proposers should understand that the research project described herein is tentative. The final content of the program depends on the level of funding made available.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br><br>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br><br>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br><br>(End of provision)<br><br>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2<br><br>(a)  The Government reserves the right to award other than the low offeror for the best price that is advantageous to the Government's using Technical, Price and Past Performance.<br><br>(b)  The total evaluated price must be reasonable, and any additional expenses must be justified by a corresponding value for technical merit, or an expectation of greater quality of performance.<br><br>(c)  Evaluation Criteria.

Award will be made to the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable offeror with an acceptable record of past performance.<br><br>PART I:  TECHNICAL EVALUATION.<br><br>Technical evaluation will be based on the following:<br><br>(a)  The offeror's technical proposal and all submitted data  must be complete.  The proposal shall be clear, concise, and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation for substantiating that the services offered meet the requirements of the solicitation.  The proposal shall not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address that the services offered clearly meet the Government's requirements.  Offerors shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge, and will base its evaluation solely on the information presented in the offeror's proposal.<br><br>(b)  The following ratings will be used in evaluation offerors proposal:<br><br>Acceptable -The Compensation and Retention Plan will be evaluated to determine the adequacy of the offeror's capability to recruit and retain quality individual health care providers (HCPs).  The primary determinant will be the base salary paid to the individual HCP.  Offerors must propose a base salary which is at least commensurate with salaries paid for similar health care providers in the local area in order to be technically acceptable.  Plans will be evaluated as realistic in terms of its impact upon recruitment and retention.  A low, or no compensation plan, may be viewed as evidence of failure to comprehend the complexity of the contract requirements or appropriate compensation levels for geographic area where performance will take place.  Offerors which propose low base salaries, particularly below rates paid in the local area, will have the burden of establishing that their plans will result in the recruitment and retention of quality personnel and the uninterrupted performance of services throughout the life of the contract.<br><br>Unacceptable - An unacceptable rating will be assessed on any offeror that presents a proposal that demonstrates any of the following:<br><br>(1)  Fails to clearly and comprehensively address each of the factors.<br><br>(2)  Fails to provide sufficient detail for the Government to determine whether the proposal satisfactorily meets the minimum requirements of this solicitation in addressing the factors.<br><br>(3)  Fails to clearly demonstrate that the offeror fully understands and is technically capable to perform the requirements at its total proposed price.<br><br>Note:  To receive consideration for award, a rating of acceptable must be achieved in all technical factors.<br><br>PART II:  PRICE.    <br><br>Price will be evaluated separately from the technical and past performance factors and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonability in terms of:<br><br>A.  That the prices are consistent with and reflect the proposed staffing requirement.<br><br>B.  Offerors are cautioned that an unrealistically low price, or unbalanced pricing of line items, as proposed initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal, either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the required services, or he has made an imprudent offer.<br><br>C.  Compensation for health care providers (employee) shall not exceed $400,000 per year for personal services IAW Title 10 U.S.C. Section 1091 and DoD Instruction 6025.5.<br><br>D.  Given that FAR 52.217-8 provides that the Government may exercise the Option to Extend Services at the rates specified in the contract (i.e., the rates in effect when the Extension of Services option is exercised), for purposes of evaluating the Option to Extend Services, the Contracting Officer will consider the prices submitted for the base year and each option year, since those are the binding prices should the Option to Extend be exercised.<br><br>E.  All vendors' prices must be deemed to be fair and reasonable to qualify for award.<br><br>PART III:  PAST PERFORMANCE.<br><br>The offeror's performance will be rated in terms of performance risk.  A performance risk rating (Low, Moderate or High) will be assigned dependent upon the evaluator's assessment of the level of confidence in the offeror's performance record.  In ranking offerors assessed in the same performance risk category, an offeror with experience in performing services will be ranked as a low risk compared to an offer with no or hardly any experience in performing services.  The information which will be used for evaluation will be obtained from those presented in the Offeror's past performance documentation, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), (http://www.ppirs.gov/)), and any other Government sources.  The Government may reject a proposal if it is found that any information that has a negative impact on the offeror's past performance record has been deleted, misrepresented or withheld.<br><br>High Risk - Significant doubt exists that the offeror will satisfactorily perform the services on solicitation, based on preponderance of unsatisfactory performance records under the various factor evaluations, or offeror's record of unsuccessful past and current contracts performance in fulfilling requirements similar to the size and complexity of the service under solicitation.  Verification of past performance shows that offerors have consistently not met work schedules and other obligations, have defaulted on at least one contract within the past three years, or have chronically failed to meet contract terms.<br><br>Medium Risk - Some doubt exists based on instances of record of poor performance, especially in contracts similar to the size and complexity of the services under solicitation.

<p>COMDTINST 4200.14A - Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />.372.3695</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to address contractor questions below and revise Statement of Work section 5(B)(b), "6-Feet Chain Link Fence with Concrete Footings" to incorporate the response to contractor questions.
Question 1: We now have a brand new chain link fence panel. This panel system uses a metal stand, which does less damage to grass areas and tree roots than a concrete block, plus we can easily add sand bags or angle braces for additional support. Can this be accepted as an equivalent? 
Response to Question 1: Items offered as "equivalent" will be considered by the Government and may be accepted if it is determined to fulfill the technical requirements of the Government. Offeror's of equivalent items must provide sufficient detail (descriptive literature, photos, etc.) to decribe the item being offered for review and approval by the Government. The Government will accept use of the metal stand (in place of concrete footings) as a method to stand the fencing.

Question 2: Will there be a lay down area provided this year and any idea where that might be?
Response to Question 2: The lay down area will be between Survey Lodge and the Tidal Basin parking lot.

Previous Statement of Work Section 5B(b): Fencing shall be interlocked by clamping sections together or by interlocking pins and shall be installed through the use of concrete blocks as not to disturb the grounds/structures. 
Revised Statement of Work Section 5B(b): Fencing shall be interlocked by clamping sections together or by interlocking pins and shall be installed through the use of concrete blocks, or approved method, as not to disturb the grounds/structures.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Contractor Question:  We know from your description that the cartridge bodies are made of brass. What are the projectile bodies made of? Metals, plastics or composites? Are the surfaces of the projectile bare, painted or coated?
-	Government Answer:  The projectile is made of steel. The surface of the projectile where the sealant is applied is bare.
Contractor Question:  Are there drawings that indicate how a sealant is to be applied and any requirements that material must have?
-	Government Answer:  This notice is a market survey; therefore, we are just looking for general information on contractor capabilities at this time. If a solicitation is issued a drawing will be provided at that time.
Contractor Question:  What cure speed requirements do you have for the sealant material? Are they minutes or hours?
-	Government Answer:  The sealant shall cure in hours.
Contractor Question:  How is the sealant material applied? 
-	Government Answer:  The sealant is applied to the projectile crimp groove by spinning the projectile against a sponge that contains the sealant.
Contractor Question:  How does the projectile fit into the cartridge body? Is it threaded or a compression/press type fit?
-	Government Answer:  The projectile fits into the cartridge case by compression/press.  After the sealant is applied 360 degrees to the projectile crimp groove, the projectile is inserted into the cartridge case.  Then the cartridge case is crimped 360 degrees around the projectile crimp groove. 
Contractor Question:  What is the tolerance between where the projectile fits into the cartridge body (i.e. what is the gap fill requirement)?
-	Government Answer:  This notice is a market survey; therefore, we are just looking for general information on contractor capabilities at this time. If a solicitation is issued a drawing will be provided at that time which will contain the tolerance requirement.
Contractor Question:  Is the propellant component and the primer of the 20mm round corrosive? Are either reactive in any way? 
-	Government Answer:  The propellant and primer are not corrosive and reactive.  The propellant contains mostly nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin.  The primer contains mostly barium nitrate and lead styphnate.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue, on a sole source basis, a solicitation procure the "Pilot Evaluation of the Chronic Disease Self Management Program" (CDSMP) to the National Council on Aging (NCOA) using Medicare administrative data.
<p>This solicitation&nbsp;is issued in accordance with FAR Part 15. .</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The NCOA is currently conducting a survey based evaluation of the CDSMP using a proprietary sample of program participants. It is CMS's intent to provide additional funding to NCOA to both build a linkage between this propriety sample of participants and Medicare Administrative Claims data and to conduct an analysis of these data to determine the CDSMP's impact on administrative measures of beneficiary health outcomes, healthcare utilization, and costs. Further, the linking of these data sources will allow the NCOA to uniquely adjust for both survey and claims based measures of potential confounders in analyzing CDSMP's impact on Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The anticipated award date of the contract is expected to be by July 11, 2011.</p>

<DESC>PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT - MARKET SURVEY/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p>PROGRAM TITLE: FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION CONTRACT WEATHER OBSERVATION (CWO) SERVICES PROGRAM</p>
<p><br />This Market Survey/RFI is for information purposes only. This Market Survey/RFI is neither a Screening Information Request (SIR) nor release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) of any kind, and does not guarantee procurement of the underlying services. Further, the Federal Aviation Administration is neither seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals.</p>
<p>All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not provide reimbursement for any information provided or any other costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry to this market survey announcement. Therefore any costs associated with market survey submissions will be solely at the interested parties expense.</p>
<p><br />POINTS OF CONTACT:</p>
<p>Donald L. Richardson, Sr., Contracting Officer, AJA-464, (202) 385-8415</p>
<p>Address all written correspondence to the following:</p>
<p>Federal Aviation Administration<br />Attn: AJA-464, Donald L. Richardson, Sr.<br />600 Independence Ave., S.W., Room 4W850<br />Washington, D.C. 20591</p>
<p>PURPOSE OF ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
<p>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration's Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS), Section 3.2.1.3.12, industry is hereby informed that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement valued at over $100,000.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The FAA is responsible for aviation weather observation services at designated locations, primarily airports, throughout the United States including remote sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico. Since March 1995, the FAA has satisfied this responsibility through the use of the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), or the Aviation Weather Observing System (AWOS), FAA employees and contract weather observer personnel.</p>
<p>Presently, the Contract Weather Observation (CWO) program utilizes 15 contractors, predominantly small and very small businesses, which provide weather observation services at 148 contract sites in FAA-owned or FAA-leased locations.</p>
<p>The following summary represents the CWO locations aligned within the three (3) Service Areas. They will be further divided into groups.</p>
<p>- Eastern Service Area contains approximately 54 sites within the following states: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>- Central Service Area contains approximately 48 sites within the following states: Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>- Western Service Area contains approximately 24 sites within the following states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, and Hawaii.</p>
<p>Alaska Service Area contains approximately 22 sites within the state of Alaska.</p>
<p><br />Objective:</p>
<p>The objective of this Market Survey/RFI is to solicit feedback from sources capable of performing aviation weather observation services. It is the FAA's intent to inform industry of a planned competitive contract(s) (estimated at over $100 million dollars) that will provide for aviation weather observer personnel to augment the ASOS and AWOS at selected airports throughout the United States, including remote sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico. The small business community primarily provides the CWO Program its current weather observation services. The FAA is now seeking to identify potential small businesses that have the experience and qualifications necessary to perform the services required. No solicitation package is currently available. However, the applicable North American Industry Classification System Code for this requirement is 541990. This future contracting opportunity will be set-aside for competition among small businesses unless the FAA determines that no adequate competition or capable small business sources exists. The FAA encourages subcontracting and teaming arrangements by all participants.</p>
<p>The FAA seeks to identify small businesses and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals that possess the following knowledge and experience:</p>
<p>1. Knowledge of FAA and National Weather Service (NWS) Orders, directives and policy relating to CWO services.</p>
<p>2. Knowledge, familiarity or experience with ASOS or AWOS.</p>
<p>3. Knowledge and understanding of the National Airspace System (NAS).</p>
<p>4. Previous experience providing or managing aviation weather observation service at multiple locations.</p>
<p>5. Previous experience, knowledge or management capability for a small business to manage other small businesses and/or small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in a contractual arrangement that would include handling payroll and reports for multiple locations or subcontractors.</p>
<p>6. The ability to provide and manage an aviation weather observation-training program.</p>
<p><br />5/06/2011 Schedule:</p>
<p>The FAA encourages the participation of all interested parties, and request that interested firms provide a letter of interest and a detailed statement of their capabilities that addresses all of the above criteria not later than <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">June 28, 2011 at 5:00 p.m. EDT</span></em></strong>. In addition, it is requested that the letter of interest contain appropriate points of contact, a completed Business Form (see attached), and indicate whether teaming arrangements for this effort will be used. No extensions to this submission will be granted. The FAA request that any proprietary information shall be marked appropriately so that all responses to this Market Survey/RFI can be properly secured and protected.</p>
<p>The FAA will use the submissions solely to identify interested firms and to gain a better insight into the level of expertise that may be required to meet the FAA's needs and to assist in determining whether a competitive small business set-aside is an appropriate procurement method for this effort. In addition, the FAA may use any comments submitted in response to the Market Survey/RFI to develop an acquisition strategy and to establish key milestone dates for the future procurement. The information obtained will not be used to qualify firms for any future opportunities. The FAA does not intend to conduct written or oral discussions regarding the information received as a result of the Market Survey/RFI. The FAA will provide further details regarding this requirement and release a list of interested firms in a future public announcement.</p>

We would like to install an 800 amp breaker in the 77 204-XSB panel. 

2.  In the solicitation, two different wire sizes are called out, 350 kcmil and 500 kcmil.  Shouldnât the design phase identify the wire size required?

Typically this would be something that would be identified in the design phase, however, our maintenance staff has already done the research to determine this. 500 kcmil will be used. 

3.  Can you verify that the required control wiring for the generator currently comes as far as Bldg 204, Rm L169?  If so, in which panel does it terminate?

Yes. Control wiring currently exists in room L169 for the 204 generator. Control wire can be paralleled from any of the transfer switches in this room. 

4.  Can you clarify which panel the new breaker is to be added to in Bldg 204, Rm L169? Is it Panel 77 204-XSB or Panel EDP?

77 204-XSB

<DESC>1.      Does the government intend for this overall effort to provide support only to the Pharmaceutical Systems Project Management Office or is this effort intended to provide support to additional PMOs and other offices within USAMMDA and / or USAMMA? <br><br>Answer:  Currently, USAMMDA is supported though several disjointed service contracts.  This situation does not optimally leverage each contractor's capabilities across the activity and often leads to uneconomical management and pricing.  The intent is to gain greater control of USAMMDA requirements through a central manager, which will have visibility of all service support for better employment.  <br><br>Four other entities within USAMMDA would potentially require support (additionally, any USAMRMC element could potentially be added to this requirement at a later date via a modification).<br>2.      Reference Part B - Requirements 2.a. Government Acquisition Program Management Office support - does the government mean staff with DAU training (certified as PM Level 2 or 3) or does the government mean administrative office support?<br><br>Answer:  Requirement - Government Acquisition Program Management Office Support- Does not imply DAU certified personnel.  Requires personnel with sufficient experience to adequately perform support required in areas (i - v), without further training.  <br><br>3.      Reference Part B - Requirements 2.a Product Manager Technical and Administrative Support - Please define.  Does the government mean contractor staff with scientific expertise related to drug / vaccine product development (FDA requirements) or in the specific areas related to the basic research (pharmacology, biochemistry, microbiology etc)<br><br>Answer:   Government implies - provide technical and functional program management support to include lifecycle oversight for pharmaceutical products.<br>Requires personnel highly qualified and experience to provide technical expertise to program manager.    <br><br>4.      Reference Part B - Requirements 2.a  Information Technology support - does the government require help desk type support or does this refer to IT management related to establishing websites and monitoring those web sites? Please clarify<br><br>Answer:   Government implies - requires both IT (Help Desk) and IT Management support at the Division (Program Management Office) level. The IT support will deliver improved electronic tools (and required training packages) for our Integrated Product Teams; will be in support of identifying a commercial off the shelf (COTS) or modified COTS solution to replace the current MS Access based financial planning, execution & reporting tool that is utilized in life cycle program management; provide improved communication venues (such as international teleconference capabilities) for collaboration with overseas and US-based development partners; and provide Knowledge Management expertise in use of our electronic data management system. <br><br>5.      Reference Part B - Requirements 2.b   Foreign government support - How is this different that the support provided by the Internationals Affairs Office, Headquarters USAMRMC?<br><br>Answer:  Government implies - requirement is to support and assist the government in achieving necessary agreements for global access to products in accordance with FDA regulations and US State Department regulations.  <br><br>6.      Reference Part B - Requirements 2.c Medical Product Development Support - Please define the level of support provided under this option.  Does the government wish the successful contractor to offer the option of conducting pre-clinical as well as clinical trials?  Or does the government simply require staff with the technical capability to provide oversight and review of the results?  <br><br>Answer:   Government implies - both support to assist the Program Manager in the selection of product testing and manufacturing facilities for clinical/non-clinical studies and to task vendors to conduct pre-clinical studies and clinical studies (world-wide). <br><br>7.      Reference Part B - Requirements 2.c Medical Product Development Support - Regulatory support - How does this requirement differ from the support provided under the recently awarded RASS contract?<br><br>Answer:   Government implies support to the Program Management Office for the development and review of regulatory related documents for submission to FDA. <br><br>8.      In Part B, Requirements, section 2, subsection c., parts ii.-iv., please clarify the extent of the support to be provided.  In other words, does support indicate provision of services such as report review, auditing, and protocol development, or does support indicate the contractor will conduct the manufacturing, testing, nonclinical and clinical studies?  <br><br>Answer:  Government implies - Support provisioning of services such as conduct manufacture of drug product, perform required product testing, conduct non-clinical studies, conduct clinical studies (world-wide), report creation, reviews, and auditing of manufacturing and testing processes.  <br><br>

<DESC>06/08/2011 Amendment 8 Q&amp;A
<p>Q21. Will the attendance list be disseminated? My reason for asking is that the services that we offer could be complementary to those offered by another firm.<br />Q21. I know you did not intend to release a list of participants in last week's conference. Nor is there a public list of POCs you are using to distribute notes on the solicitation. I recognize and appreciate the OPSEC measures result from these restrictions. However, respectfully request you reconsider that decision to assist in improving competition and/or in teaming opportunities to meet the small business subcontracting participation you desire on this award. Maybe you could ask your industry POCs if they want their info released, and if so, just release it to those firms which have provided that permission<br />A21. After careful consideration of numerous issues and much internal discussion, the decision remains not to disclose interested vendors or vendor conference attendees. The Government greatly appreciates the interest in this acquisition.</p>
<p>Q22. Will the slides from yesterday's vendor conference be made available to the contractors?<br />A22. The classified slides from the vendor conference held on June 02 are available using the same procedures as the other classified documents under this Solicitation.</p>
<p>Q23. I noticed there is another solicitation for SCEO Administrative and Technical Support Services Solicitation RFI012588. Is there any relationship to Solicitation HHM402-11-R-0118?<br />Q23. The solicitation appears to be de-scoped from the RFI's numerous task areas to the current solicitation which focuses on technical support.<br />A23. A Request For Information posting does not commit the Government to a Solicitation. This Solicitation stands on its own. The Government sees little value in connecting this Solicitation to any RFI.</p>
<p>Q24. Who are the incumbent companies performing the technical support?<br />A24. See Q2 and A2.</p>
<p>Q25. Will the sub-factors for the evaluation criteria be weighted in the final version?<br />A25. The sub-factors have equal weight. The final Section M in the Solicitation has been corrected to say "All sub-factors are weighted equally."</p>
<p>Q26. In preparation for the RFP, have you identified how much time preparers will have to respond to the RFP? <br />A26. As posted on FedBizOpps on Friday, May 20: The deadline to submit proposals is 2 PM EST on Tuesday, July 12, 2011.</p>
<p>Q27. Can there be a clarification as to the distinction between having a SCIF and the contractor's ability to handle classified information?<br />A27. A Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) is an area accredited by an individual agency, and that accrediting authority is responsible for the protection of Sensitive Compartmented Information as well as any other classified information processed within the SCIF. For this Solicitation, the level of safeguarding needs to be determined by the Defense Security Service (DSS), as verified by a company's CAGE. DSS certification is clear and established; the agency accrediting a SCIF may or may not permit documents under this Solicitation, which means a SCIF is not a pass/fail factor.</p>
<p>Q28. This Solicitation has the NAICS of 541330 and mentions a small business set aside. That means a large business cannot compete, right?<br />A28. This Solicitation is a full and open competition acquisition. All businesses may compete. The NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) must be chosen for each posting on FedBizOpps. The size standard is set by the Small Business Administration for this NAICS but the size standard for this NAICS does not limit the competition for this acquisition; it further defines the meaning of the NAICS. See the Solicitation for proposal requirements for a large business.</p>

<AWARDEE>Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., 600 Maryland Avenue, SW
Suite 550, Washington, DC 20024-2512 US
<DESC>The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, Title XIII of Division A and Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. 111-5) was enacted on February 17, 2009 to improve health care quality, safety, and efficiency through the promotion of health information technology (HIT) and electronic health information exchange. The HITECH Act also amended several sections of the Social Security Act and in doing so established the availability of incentive payments to eligible professionals and eligible hospitals to promote the adoption and meaningful use of electronic health records (EHRs). Title IV, Division B of the HITECH Act establishes incentive payments under the Medicare and Medicaid programs for certain professionals and hospitals that meaningfully use Certified EHR Technology. CMS is charged with implementing the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Program and developing a portfolio of clinical quality measures that can be reported by Eligible Professionals (EPs) directly from their EHRs to CMS and the States.
<p>The CMS EHR Incentive Program includes three stages for meaningful use of certified EHRs. Stage 1 meaningful use criteria focus on electronically capturing health information in a coded format, using that information to track key clinical conditions, communicating that information for care coordination purposes, and initiating the reporting of clinical quality measures and public health information.</p>
<p>The CMS EHR Incentive Program includes 44 clinical quality measures for reporting by Eligible Professionals (EPs) for program years 2011 and 2012. CMS has approximately 40 additional measures that were electronically specified to be used in EHRs. The clinical quality measures developed specifically for use in EHRs or existing measures electronically specified under this Task Order will be added to the current EHR measure portfolio for potential inclusion in the CMS EHR Incentive Program beginning 2013. The final rule for the CMS EHR Incentive Program for 2013 and beyond is anticipated to be published June 2012 and will include the measures to be reported in future program years to CMS and the States.</p>
<p>Health care provider adoption and use of EHRs creates new opportunities to improve the quality of care for Americans by utilizing this rich source of clinical information. Electronic capture and real-time access to clinical patient data will promote the communication of care between health care providers to ensure care coordination and also provide patients with the information they need to actively participate in their own care. To this end, CMS is developing a portfolio of clinical quality measures that capitalize on the clinical data documented in EHRs for use in the CMS EHR Incentive Program.</p>
<p>The purpose of the ARRA HITECH EP Clinical Quality Measures Task Order under the Measure &amp; Instrument Development and Support (MIDS) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Umbrella Statement of Work (USOW) is to develop, electronically specify and maintain clinical quality measures that will be used for reporting by EPs using certified EHR systems. The clinical quality measures electronically specified or developed de novo (new measures using the EHR as the data source) have multiple end users, of those are two primary end users: Health Information Technology (HIT) vendors/programmers and health care providers.</p>

Justification Review Document

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Contracting Organization:  VA Black Hills Health Care System, Fort Meade, SD

2.  Description of Action:  A sole source contract is contemplated for acquisition of emergency roof repair 
services to address wind damage to several buildings at the Fort Meade Campus. On Saturday, April 30th, 2011, high winds of sustained speeds up to 45 to 50 mph and with gusts in excess of 80 mph occurred in the Northern Black Hills. Several buildings were damaged due to the high winds. 

3.  Description of Commodities:  Work consists of initial work to provide temporary tar paper weather protection, replacing entire shingled roofs where large sections of shingles have blown off, patching roofs where minor damage occurred, and repairing/replacing damaged flashings, and some siding. 

4.  Statutory Authority:  FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency. 

5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority: There are multiple buildings currently that are not water tight and will be subject to water damage from weather events. Water damage will increase repair costs and impact activities of essential government operations. This creates an unusual and compelling emergency to complete repairs ASAP. There is insufficient time to create plans/specifications prior to proceeding with work and insufficient time to get competitive pricing due to the needed expedited timeline. 
  
6. Sources Solicited:   Diamond Roofing is a local small business with capability to start immediately with repairs. They have the resources to address multiple buildings simultaneously and are in a position to proceed as soon as provided a notice to proceed. They have completed other roofing projects at the facility as a sub-contractor and have a proven record of responsiveness and competency. Diamond roofing is a roof shingling contractor with experienced staff that has the competency to initiate work with little technical direction. 

7.  Market Research Conducted:  The Central Contractors Registry and VetBiz were searched for available SDVOSB Roofing firms in the serviceable area and identified none.  There are SDVOSB General Construction Contractors, but they would ultimately sub-contract the work out to a roofing contractor, thus adding an unnecessary level of additional cost and time to the repair. Due to the urgent need to initiate emergency roof repairs in order to avoid water damage to the inside of the buildings, Diamond Roofing  was the only roofing contractor contacted that was available to start the work immediately. No further market research was conducted. 

8. Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:  Wind damages occurred throughout the area and  local roofers are busy addressing the damages, thus availability of roofing contractors able to address the VAâs needed work in the immediate future is limited. 

10.  Actions to remove Barriers to Competition: Blown off shingled roofs are being replaced with 120 mph rated roofing systems that should be less susceptible to wind damage thus decreasing the need for emergency roof repairs in the future. 

11.  Fair and Reasonable Price:  Pricing for previous work performed by this contractor has always been in line with Government estimates.  The government estimate to complete this work is $70,000
 
12.  Contracting Officer's Certification:  Based upon the information provided herein, I believe the justification for awarding this project design to Diamond Roofing on a sole-source basis is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and recommend we proceed as such.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  

REQUEST FOR OXYGEN DELIVERY FOR BOSTON VA HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR REMAINDER OF THE FISCAL YEAR. AN ADDITIONAL REQUEST HAS ALREADY BEEN SUBMITTED UNDER TRANSACTION # 523-11-2-7914-0164 FOR AN ANNUAL DELIVERY CONTRACT W/ OPTION YEARS.  THIS EMERGENCY TRANSACTION WILL BE PUT IN PLACE FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE OXYGEN FOR THE HOSPITAL UNTIL THE NEW CONTRACT IS ESTABLISHED.  OXYGEN IS A CRITICAL REQUIREMENT FOR DIRECT PATIENT CARE OF RESPIRATORY PATIENTS.  

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

Tanks of oxygen for all three campuses of the Boston VA healthcare system.  Approximately $13,000.00/month Includes e-     cylinders and h tanks.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

( X )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

This is the product to be utilized in conjunction with equipment already owned by the VA.  Air Gas East is the current vendor supplying oxygen to the Boston VA Medical Centers.  A new contract with option years is currently being devolved with an estimated start date of June 1, 2011.  This emergency transaction will be awarded to the incumbent Air Gas East for the following months while the new contract is being competed in order to ensure there is no disruption of supplies to the hospital, which would result in a direct patient care issue.  It was estimated that the PO would only be needed for the next three months but it was funded through 09/30/2011 in case of any unforeseen circumstances in the development of the new contract.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  
No other vendors were contacted at this point in time.  Air Gas East is the current vendor supplying oxygen to the Boston VA Medical Centers.  A new contract with option years is currently being devolved with an estimated start date of June 1, 2011.  This emergency transaction will be awarded to the incumbent Air Gas East for the following months while the new contract is being competed in order to ensure there is no disruption of supplies to the hospital, which would result in a direct patient care issue.  It was estimated that the PO would only be needed for the next three months but it was funded through 09/30/2011 in case of any unforeseen circumstances in the development of the new contract.


7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  
The anticipated dollar value of the proposed acquisition is $72,750.00.  The Contracting Officer determined that the anticipated price will be fair and reasonable based on the fact that Air Gas East is the current vendor supplying oxygen to the Boston VA Medical Centers.  A new contract with option years is currently being devolved with an estimated start date of June 1, 2011.  This emergency transaction will be awarded to the incumbent Air Gas East for the following months while the new contract is being competed in order to ensure there is no disruption of supplies to the hospital, which would result in a direct patient care issue.  It was estimated that the PO would only be needed for the next three months but it was funded through 09/30/2011 in case of any unforeseen circumstances in the development of the new contract.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
No Market research was conducted due to the extreme urgency of this request. Tanks on station are owned by the vendor referenced on the request.  Air Gas East is the current vendor supplying oxygen to the Boston VA Medical Centers.  A new contract with option years is currently being devolved with an estimated start date of June 1, 2011.  This emergency transaction will be awarded to the incumbent Air Gas East for the following months while the new contract is being competed in order to ensure there is no disruption of supplies to the hospital, which would result in a direct patient care issue.  It was estimated that the PO would only be needed for the next three months but it was funded through 09/30/2011 in case of any unforeseen circumstances in the development of the new contract.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section VI above
