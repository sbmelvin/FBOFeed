<DESC>Proposal Submission Place:  Mr. Kwadwa Agyepong, Ag. Chief Director, Ministry of Trade and Industry, P.O. Box M47 Ministries, Accra, Ghana, Telephone:  (233-21) 686-500, Fax:  (233-21) 664-115.
 Ghana:  Solar Salt Production Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study for development of commercial solar salt production for the country of Ghana.

Despite the abundance of raw salt--either in deposits or in contained bodies of salt water (ponds, lagoons, etc.)--throughout West Africa, the region imports most of its processed salt from Brazil and Argentina.  Ghana alone has the salt resources for several 350,000-ton/year facilities, yet has no commercial domestic refining capacity.  The total annual demand for salt in West Africa is 852,000 tons.  Sensing the opportunity to develop a salt export industry, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has worked with project developers to fast-track the commissioning of up to three facilities in Ghana.  One 350,000-ton facility would cover half the import demand of nearby Nigeria.  

Sege Salt Works, Digoltz, Ltd., and Ada Salt Works are current producers of solar salt on the Songhor Lagoon, just outside of Accra, Ghana.  They each intend to expand their current production to a commercial size operation of at least 300,000 tones per year.  The Feasibility Study will offer a blueprint that will allow the operators of Sege Salt Works, Digoltz, Ltd. and Ada Salt Works to obtain financing for commercial solar salt farming.

The objective of this study is to assist the three private sector companies develop commercial salt refining capabilities.  The study tasks are summarized as follows:  1) determine the adequacy of this sites for solar salt production and verify markets, 2) evaluate the proposed designs of each of the facilities and determine equipment requirements, 3) prepare an environment assessment for the projects, and 4) prepare draft feasibility report and final report.  It should be noted that each task contains a number of subtasks that will need to be completed to successfully complete the Feasibility Study.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $102,040 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 2:00 P.M., Monday, September 30, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>IT IS A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CONTRACTOR BE REGISTERED IN THE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION PRIOR TO AWARD OF THE CONTRACT.  The work includes furnishing all labor, materials, supervision, equipment, tools, permits, training, certifications, and licenses necessary to provide servicing of waste oil accumulation points and oil/water separators, transport and disposal of waste oil, and other waste oil management services at the Coastal Systems Station in Panama City, FL.  These services include, but are not limited to performing scheduled and on-call waste collection; field testing and classification; hazardous and non-hazardous oily waste; operation of oil/water separators and oil waste dump stations; servicing ships at pierside hotel stations to include maintaining the hotel stations and pierside utility boxes at dockside; and groundwater monitoring well inspection and bailing.  The resultant contract will be a combination firm fixed price and indefinite quantity service type contract.  The contract award will be for a period of twelve months with four additional option periods not to exceed a total of 60 months.  Contract award will be based on the evaluation of two factors:  (1)  the offeror's price and (2) the offeror's recent relevant past performance.  Price is considered relatively more important than past performance.  However, the selection decision will depend on the marginal differences among the competing offers, which will not be known until after all the offers have been received and compared with each other.  The offeror's price and past performance information will be used to evaluate which offer is the best overall value to the Government.   Price Evaluation:  The price competitiveness of each offer will be evaluated by comparing each offeror's prices for the solicitation.  Past Performance Evaluation:  The Navy will review information about the offeror's past performance within the last five years on work that is similar to this solicitation in size, scope, and complexity.  More recent and relevant experience may be viewed more favorably.  Past performance includes the degree by which the offeror has satisfied its customers by delivering quality work in a timely manner at a reasonable total cost.  It also includes the offeror's reputation for integrity, reasonable and cooperative conduct, and commitment to customer satisfaction.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all quotes at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any and all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest price; and to award a contract to the offeror submitting the quote determined to be the most advantageous to the Government.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE QUOTES RECEIVED.  THEREFORE, QUOTES SHOULD BE SUBMITTED ON THE MOST FAVORABLE TERMS FROM A PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE STANDPOINT WHICH THE OFFEROR CAN SUBMIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.  OFFERORS SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT THEY WILL BE CONTACTED OR AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO QUALIFY, DISCUSS, OR REVISE THE QUOTE.  The NAICCS Code is 562111 ($6M).  This Solicitation is unrestricted with 10% price evaluation preference for Hub-Zone Small Business Concerns.

<DESC>NA CONTACT GABOR BODA, SUPERVISORY GENERAL ENGINEER, 732-532-2425. This is a market survey to locate sources who can supply the commercially produced: university level family of audio language laboratory systems for a period of five years. This will be an IDI Q type contract to satisfy future requirements. Currently there are two levels of this system, both of which are made up of an Instructor Console and any number of Student Consoles. The system must be compatible with Defense Language Institute English Lang uage Center (DLIELC) specific hardware and software, including interactive CODECS, switching, routing, distribution and monitoring. Elements of the system must meet the requirements of DLIELC in form, fit and function to insure total compliance with DLIELC ’s Interactive Courseware Training Materials for CONUS/OCONUS users. Audio-Active: The Audio-Active Instructor control consists of audiocassette program recorders/players along with the required electronic and power supplies for distribution of audio, as w ell as controls for the student/instructor interactive functions. A TV/VHS kit is an option for audiovisual tapes, consisting of a VHS recorder player, console mounted small screen TV for the Instructor, and a pair of large screen TV's, on roll around cart s. The Audio-Active Student Console consists of an audio-active amplifier with a call button, volume control and a V.U. meter, and a headset/microphone combination unit. In Audio-Active operation, the instructor sends programs to individual students via li ve voice or prerecorded audiotapes. As the student responds to what he heard in one earphone, he hears his response in the other earphone. The instructor can record the response on one of the Instructor Console cassette tape recorders. The instructor can m onitor individuals, groups and/or the entire class. Students can initiate calls to the instructor at the Instructor Console. Audio-Video-Interactive: Operates as the Audio-Active but in addition, the Student Console contains a PC. The Instructor Console is  fully interactive with audio and videocassette recorders, video laserdisc players, and CD-ROM/MPEG devices. Student participation is via mouse, keyboard and integrally installed AUDIO-ACTIVE amplifier with 2-way communications to the instructor. The syste ms should have similar operating specifications and physical characteristics as the present systems that are now in use. The current source for this item is GEL SYSTEMS Inc., CAGE 98983. The government does not have any drawings/specifications for this ite m. Suppliers capable of furnishing this system must so indicate, by writing to Commander, USACECOM; ATTN: AMSEL-LC-SA-CCA (Gabor Boda); Building 1208; Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5000.

This acquisition will utilize the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334513, and the size standard is 500 employees.  The solicitation will be conducted using FAR Part 15 procedures and will be awarded to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements and will provide the best value to the government considering mission capability, past performance and price.  The government intends to award multiple firm-fixed price contracts to evaluate the current status and state of the art implementation of the existing Model 3500 Datachron Timing and Programming System (TPS) and develop a plan that includes identification of wiring and related issues that must be addressed to co-locate a Primary and Back-Up TPS at the Holloman High Speed Test Track, with a down-selection to one contract to implement the plan via design, fabrication, reconfiguration, and integration of the existing Model 3500 TPS into a system that will have primary and back-up capability and integration of the TPS into the existing Holloman High Speed Test Track cable infrastructure.  Period of performance of the basic effort is expected to be approximately four (4) months with the period of performance of the implementation dependent upon results of the initial study.  This will be a web-posted solicitation.  The solicitation will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or around 13 Aug 02.  The government will not distribute hard-copy solicitations, attachments, exhibits, or amendment documents.  Subsequent amendments to the solicitation, if any, will be promulgated via the Federal Business Opportunities website.  Prospective offerors are responsible for checking the referenced website early and periodically for the solicitation and any solicitation amendments.

The government is not responsible for any loss of Internet connectivity or for an offeror's inability to access the document posted on the referenced website.  Any questions pertaining to this solicitation should be addressed in writing by e-mail or fax to Ms. Barbara L. Minto, Contracting Officer at e-mail address barbara.minto@46tg.af.mil or fax 505-572-1396.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer identified above.

Chemical ElectroPhysics Co. is the only known manufacturer of a sensor that employs a proprietary method to deposit robust electrodes on a ceramic substrate, which is then mounted to the ceramic substrate in the barrel of an extruder where it has to withstand high temperatures and abrasion of filled polymer resins.  CEP is uniquely qualified to fulfill the Government's needs by providing the CEP Dielectric Slit Die and Proceptor ? Data Acquisition System Package.*****Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within ninety (90) days or less after receipt of purchase order (ARO).*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by August 13, 2002, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.*****

<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for risk analysis software.  The Virtual Airspace Modeling and Simulation (VAMS) Project is currently in the formulation phase and is planning to acquire mature, validated software to analyze risk (schedule, cost, and quality) trade-offs and alternatives, and/or recommendations to mitigate the risks and to optimize the program.  The software will provide schedule estimation, risk assessment and optimization/trade-off analysis based on extensive industry specific data.  To be valid, these models of team composition (experience and skill mix) and the subsequent risk assessment and optimization simulations must have a solid basis of recognized current data. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/ARC intends to purchase the item, SimVision Software from Vite Corporation of Mountain View, CA under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1).  It is critical that the simulation has the capability to examine alternative approaches and to predict risks based on probabilistic analysis of project execution.  The organizational simulation and analysis must predict risks to schedule, product quality and product costs, and test multiple alternatives to determine the best means of risk mitigation.  The simulation software also must have an industry specific database. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:30 p.m. local time on August 12, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH, has a requirement for the development and testing of a Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) Vaccine. The purpose of this RFP is to provide resources for the initial development of MVA vaccine candidates. It is the intent of the Government to provide contract support for the development and stockpiling of MVA vaccines through the issuance of sequential RFPs. This current RFP (NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-44) is intended to provide resources for the initial development of MVA vaccine candidates. It is anticipated that one (1) or more cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of three (3) years, beginning approximately January 31, 2003. This RFP also includes a Part B to the Statement of Work as an Option provision under FAR 17.2. RFP-NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-44 will be available electronically on or about August 15, 2002, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract, and will be posted on FedBizOpps. Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

In addition, the Government intends to issue a second RFP, entitled Production and Acquisition of MVA Vaccine, on or about June 2003. The main objectives of the second RFP will be to: a) execute a plan to manufacture, formulate, fill and finish, and test, assuming 30 X 106 doses of MVA in accordance with cGMP regulations; b) deliver to the Government up to 30 million doses of vaccine to constitute a stockpile for emergency use under IND, and to maintain the stockpile as needed; and c) provide a licensure plan to include the conduct of expanded human safety studies required for licensure and the conduct of pivotal animal protection studies. Participation in RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-44 will not be a pre-requisite for participation in the second RFP, Production and Acquisition of MVA Vaccine; the second RFP will be a full and open, competitive acquisition.

<DESC>U.S GOVERNMENT SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT, ATLANTA, GA.  As required by 41 U.S.C. 253(f), this serves to provide notice that the U.S. Government intends to negotiate a sole source procurement for a succeeding lease of approximately 45,624 Rentable Square Feet of office and related space at the Davidson Building, Koger Center, Atlanta, GA.  A new contract will be created to reflect a 10-year, 5-year firm term lease.  It would cost the Government approximately $685,000 to duplicate the facility.  This location houses the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDH) and is co-located with two other buildings at this office park.  These Divisions interact on programmatic issues on a daily basis.  The close proximity of these three buildings is essential in maintaining the integrity of this programmatic interaction.  Many of the Center's goals cross Divisional lines, therefore, co-location is critical.  These three buildings share facilities with one another.  The Office of the Director (OD) of this Center is located in one of the three buildings and he and his management team interact with all Divisions on a daily basis.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The work to be performed is a technical study and design analyses that will support the generation of a Dragon Warrior Functional Requirement Document and outline its System Segment Design Document.  In developing this study, it is the Navy's goal to reuse as much of the Tactical Control System (TCS) software (Block 3) as practical and to identify feasible changes to TCS for the optimum interface.  This study will identify any potential architectural changes to the TCS to control a Dragon Warrior Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) payloads, datalinks, and users on commercial personal computers.  The contractor will support the Navy by attempting to achieve a fully integrated and seamless TCS system that will be used by Dragon Warrior.  Successful completion of this effort requires intimate knowledge of the TCS core hardware and software, various UAV related systems and the relationship of UAVs within the air reconnaissance architecture.  Raytheon E-Systems, Inc. is the only known source that possesses the peculiar engineering data, knowledge of TCS design and operation requirements, capability, and expertise required to successfully provide these supplies and services in an accurate and timely manner.  The estimated period of performance is 30 Sep 02 to 31 Dec 02.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

Brooks AFB, TX 78235-5219

SUBJECT:  Solicitation AFCEE-02-0001, Amendment 02, Privatization of Military Family Housing (Little Rock AFB, AR)


The purpose of this amendment is to change the solicitation as indicated.  Offerors shall acknowledge all solicitation amendments as required by the Offeror?s Cover Page, Appendix S of the solicitation.  

If you have questions or concerns please contact Jones Lang LaSalle at http://www.jllpsc.com/


Amended Item:


The proposal due date is changed from 5 August 2002 to 14 August 2002
			



END OF AMENDMENT NUMBER TWO






Jones Lang LaSalle, acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), and the Air Education and Training Command, anticipates the release  of the Request for Proposals for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas on or about 26 June 2002.

Jones Lang LaSalle intends to employ a two-step RFP process, with an optional 3rd step.  In the first step, each prospective offeror (or offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources and a brief summary of its approach to the Little Rock AFB project.  Jones Lang LaSalle, with Air Force concurrence, will pre-qualify those offerors that satisfactorily demonstrate their financial and technical capability and understanding of the requirements of the Little Rock project.  In the second (optional) step of the RFP process, Jones Lang LaSalle, with Air Force concurrence, may invite the pre-qualified offerors to participate in a one-day interview and concept refinement presentation.  In the 3rd step, up to three qualified offerors will be invited to submit fully specified technical and financial proposals.  Jones Lang LaSalle will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Successful Offeror (SO) to the Air Force.

The Little Rock Project involves the complete renovation of 1,201 units and upgrade of 334 previously renovated units.  The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 1,535 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years.  The Successful Offeror shall also assume the existing financial obligation of the Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHPs).  The Air Force expects to contribute leased real property and improvements, and may subsidize the project's financing to the degree necessary to enter into an agreement with the successful private offeror.  The Successful Offeror (SO) will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the Little Rock family housing inventory.  Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the SO will be entitled to the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the SO.  This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  The Statement of Need is available at http://www.jllpsc.com.

<DESC>Little Rock AFB RFP (AFCEE-02-0001)
Clarifying Questions								29 July 2002

Q 1.  Is there any chance that the water source heat pump assignment will not be made a requirement?

A 1.  No, as described in section 1.3.2 Project Concept 


Q 2.  If the pumps are part of the project, what happens when new housing is proposed w/different mechanical systems?

A 2.  The Ground Source Heat Pumps are part of the project and it is the Offeror's responsibility to determine what mechanical systems to utilize in its new housing.


Q 3.  If the pumps are required to be taken on by the Developer, is the existing contract/warranties transferable to the Developer?

A 3.  Yes ? the warranties are transferable for the remainder of the warranty period.  Units were installed in Apr 1998 and at that time the warranty in effect was for one year from installation.  This warranty included all parts and labor.  An extended warranty was purchased for the seal refrigerant circuit parts on all heat pump units for a period of 60 months (the parts only include compressor, air/air and air/water heat exchangers, reversing valve body, and refrigerant metering device.)   This warranty will expire on or about Apr 2003.  A copy of the current ClimateMaster warranty data relating to the Ground Source heat Pumps is available for review in the Housing Privatization Office Document Room.


Q 4.  	Subject:		Page Limitations 
RFQ Reference:	Section 5.1

Do (1.) Table of Contents, (2.) Tabs/Section Dividers, and (3.) Letters of Interest count towards the page limitations? 

A 4.  No


Q 5.  	Subject:		Submittal Requirements
RFQ Reference:	Section 4.2.1

Are there any guidelines on the style and type of tabs/section dividers that can be used?

A 5.  No


Q 6.  	Subject:		Street Lighting
RFQ Reference:	Section 2.2.2

Who is responsible for street lighting, will the SO or the Government pay for street lighting, how will the charges be assessed, and will the charges be at the DoD or non-DoD rates?

A 6.  The street lighting is being conveyed to the SO; therefore the SO will be responsible for the street lighting.  Electricity usage within the housing communities is master metered.  All the houses within the communities are sub metered.  Street lighting within the housing area is within the master metered community.  This residual electricity usage will be billed at the Non-DoD rates.


Q 7.  	Subject:		Water and Wastewater
RFQ Reference:	Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4

Could the Government confirm that the Government pays for and provides water and wastewater services with no fees to the SO?

A 7.  The government will provide water and wastewater services and the SO shall pay the DoD rate for such as noted in Appendix M.  The SO shall be responsible for infrastructure maintenance as per section 2.2.


Q 8.  	Subject:		Permitting
RFQ Reference:	Section 3.4.2.3

Please identify the entities from which the SO obtains required permits?

A 8.  Permitting requirements will be dependent upon the developer?s proposal.


Q 9.  	Subject:		Municipal Services
RFQ Reference:	Section 3.5.8

The RFQ states that the Government reserves the right to be reimbursed for fire and police service costs incurred by the Government on behalf of the SO. In what instances will the Government charge the SO for municipal services and what costs?

A 9.  See amendment Number 1 to the Little Rock RFP concerning Municipal Services.




Q 10.  In the RFP it identifies criteria of experience at a threshold of $25MM. Is this determined as residential design and construction experience with residential projects including multifamily, stick built structures, or is this to be based solely on single family and duplex developments?

A 10.  The RFP provides sufficient and appropriate guidance concerning this subject.  No further information shall be provided.


Q 11.  Under Volume 1, Factor 10, page 64 of RFP - "Description of organizations for management of functional scope" - can you provide an explanation of what you want in this area?

A 11.  The descriptions and guidance provided in the RFP adequately address this question.



Jones Lang LaSalle, acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), and the Air Education and Training Command, anticipates the release  of the Request for Proposals for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas on or about 26 June 2002.

<DESC>This is the re-establishment/re-posting of the synopsis which first appeared on May 2, 2002 and was reposted on June 6, 2002 and again on July 28, 2002. The RFP files should be uploaded by July 31, 2002 and the projected proposal due date is Sept. 4, 2002.  Thank you for your patience on this matter.  Repeat of original synopsis:  The Department of Justice, Environmental and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) and the Tax Division, have a continuing requirement for a contractor to provide various nonpersonal administrative support services such as copy, file, and supply room operations, scanning and faxing services, interbuilding mail messenger services, and copy machine maintenance.  The contract is available for use by all DOJ components, but its focus is on the ENRD and Tax Divisions.  The contractor shall be responsible for providing and supervising sufficient qualified staff (est. at 45-65 positions), providing and maintaining equipment, vehicles, and supplies, in order to successfully perform these tasks for ENRD and Tax at fixed unit prices per month, fixed price per piece, and on a labor hour (t&m), ID/IQ basis.  The predominant place of performance is the Washington, DC metropolitan area, with some staffing to be provided in Denver, CO, and copy machine maintenance to be provided in other cities such as Sacramento and San Francisco, CA, Seattle, WA, and Anchorage, AK.  The anticipated period of performance is October 1, 2002 through September 30, 2003, with four additional option years available to extend the term of the contract through September 30, 2007.  The current contract (DOJ No. 97-C-0037) providing these services expires 09/30/2002 but may be extended if needed.  This RFP will be a "full and open" competition for a single contractor to provide the entirety of the requirements; accordingly any proposals to provide only parts of the requirements will not be considered.  No advance information or meetings regarding the RFP are available at this time - it is anticipated that the RFP will be uploaded to the EPS not later than June 5, 2002.  This contract is subject to the Service Contract Act of 1965 and large business offerors will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan.  However, this RFP requirement is not a set-aside of any type.

<CONTACT>TaLisa Spottswood, 703-602-3661
<DESC>NA The purpose of this modification is to post all questions and answers.  All other information remains the same.  Solicitations will still be due NLT 12 noon on 02 August 2002, to TaLisa M. Spottswood, 703-602-3659 fax, or talisa.spottswood@hqda.army.mil. QUESTION:  The requirement for a NSA Comsec Account. Will there be any requirement for storage or coding of the STU3's? ANSWER:  Yes there is a requirement for storage and coding of the STU III. QUESTION:  Will the 4th STU3 required for installation in the LSH be government furnished? ANSWER:  The 4th STU III will require installation in a Mid-size Sedan QUESTION:  We will also need exact make/model/years of the vehicles involved in the removal and installation process to verify any mounting hardware, cabling etc. requirements for materials. ANSWER:  The vehicles involved in the removal are 2000, and will be installed in 2003 vehicles. QUESTION:  Once the equipment is installed, the radios have to be maintained to make sure they're keeping the proper frequency, etc.  My question is whether or not that maintenance will be provided by the winner of the contract or by the government's radio  and/or maintenance shop?  Even if they come with a warranty, they have to be sent somewhere to be maintained.  That maintenance would be handled either by the contract winner or the government's own shop ANSWER:  The maintenance will not be provided by the winner of the contract or by the government's radio and/or maintenance shop.  It is covered under another contract (Computer Aided Dispatch System Maintenance Contract). QUESTION:  Contractor assumes subject equipment for installation to be GFE.  ANSWER:  The equipment will be removed from the old fleet and installed into the new fleet. QUESTION:  Are subject services to be performed on armored vehicles? ANSWER:  The list of vehicles is in the modification to the solicitation on fedbizopps QUESTION:  You have specifically mentioned a clearance with the NSA? In the past I have held a Secret clearance through DSS, if I have this re-instated will it suffice or must I obtain one from NSA? ANSWER:  The program office has stated that you would need an NSA clearance because only certain people with certain credentials are allowed to handle secured STU III phones. QUESTION:  Will the scheduling of the removals and installs be done by me or by yourself or an on-site fleet manager? ANSWER:  The COR or on-site fleet manager would schedule the removals and installations.    QUESTION:  Will the removal and installation process be performed concurrently, i.e. removal from old vehicle followed by re-install into waiting new vehicle or will it involve blocks of removals and later installs? ANSWER:  That has yet to be decided.  The new vehicles will come in on a rolling basis, starting in October.  This would have to be arranged with the COR or on-site fleet manager.  QUESTION:  Why is there such a long performance period, I figure 182 calendar days or 123 workdays minus holidays? Will there be a limited number of removals and installs in any given week or can I perform as many as I can every week and finish in two mont hs time? ANSWER:  The new vehicles will come in on a rolling basis, starting in October.  It is unknown, which vehicles will arrive which day, and in what quantity they will arrive on any given day.

<DESC>IT IS A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CONTRACTOR BE REGISTERED IN THE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION PRIOR TO AWARD OF THE CONTRACT.  The work includes furnishing all labor, materials, supervision, equipment, tools, permits, training, certifications, and licenses necessary to provide servicing of waste oil accumulation points and oil/water separators, transport and disposal of waste oil, and other waste oil management services at the Coastal Systems Station in Panama City, FL.  These services include, but are not limited to performing scheduled and on-call waste collection; field testing and classification; hazardous and non-hazardous oily waste; operation of oil/water separators and oil waste dump stations; servicing ships at pierside hotel stations to include maintaining the hotel stations and pierside utility boxes at dockside; and groundwater monitoring well inspection and bailing.  The resultant contract will be a combination firm fixed price and indefinite quantity service type contract.  The contract award will be for a period of twelve months with four additional option periods not to exceed a total of 60 months.  Contract award will be based on the evaluation of two factors:  (1)  the offeror's price and (2) the offeror's recent relevant past performance.  Price is considered relatively more important than past performance.  However, the selection decision will depend on the marginal differences among the competing offers, which will not be known until after all the offers have been received and compared with each other.  The offeror's price and past performance information will be used to evaluate which offer is the best overall value to the Government.   Price Evaluation:  The price competitiveness of each offer will be evaluated by comparing each offeror's prices for the solicitation.  Past Performance Evaluation:  The Navy will review information about the offeror's past performance within the last five years on work that is similar to this solicitation in size, scope, and complexity.  More recent and relevant experience may be viewed more favorably.  Past performance includes the degree by which the offeror has satisfied its customers by delivering quality work in a timely manner at a reasonable total cost.  It also includes the offeror's reputation for integrity, reasonable and cooperative conduct, and commitment to customer satisfaction.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all quotes at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any and all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest price; and to award a contract to the offeror submitting the quote determined to be the most advantageous to the Government.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE QUOTES RECEIVED.  THEREFORE, QUOTES SHOULD BE SUBMITTED ON THE MOST FAVORABLE TERMS FROM A PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE STANDPOINT WHICH THE OFFEROR CAN SUBMIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.  OFFERORS SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT THEY WILL BE CONTACTED OR AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO QUALIFY, DISCUSS, OR REVISE THE QUOTE.  The NAICCS Code is 562111 ($6M).  This Solicitation is unrestricted with 10% price evaluation preference for Hub-Zone Small Business Concerns.

Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted.  The contractor shall be responsible for operation and maintenance of Air Force facilities at Eareckson Air Station, Shemya Island, Alaska.  Duties include (partial list) airfield management, operations, and maintenance; on-station management; corrosion control; equipment and facilities repair; fire protection; power production; water treatment and distribution systems; heating systems; roads and grounds (incl. snow removal); fuels management; weather support; and visitor support services (lodging, food, etc.).  The Government will probably issue the solicitation in the early fall of 2003, with award in the February-March 2004 time frame and with performance to begin on 1 October 2004.  The current and previous contracts were solicited on an unrestricted basis, but the Government solicits capability statements and expressions of interest and intent from small businesses.  Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise in airfield management, please include information as to the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement.  Small businesses (including veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned,  HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women-owned, and other small businesses) are particularly invited to respond to express interest in submitting a proposal and to provide information as to their qualifications.  The current contract was acquired with SIC 8744, Facilities Support Management Services.  The corresponding NAICS is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The corresponding size standard is $23M.  The current contract's Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for industry comments.  The contracting officer invites comment from industry as to whether using a SOO would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer.  Under the SOO approach, the Government would issue a SOO as part of it solicitation. The SOO would broadly describe the top-level requirements allowing industry maximum flexibility to propose innovative and cost effective methods to meet those objectives.  The previous acquisition for this requirement was not accomplished under FAR Part 12 because of the complexity and type of contract terms and conditions.  However, responses to this synopsis will be used to assist the contracting officer to determine whether the upcoming acquisition can be accomplished under Part 12.  Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities, and resources to satisfactorily perform the mission as stated in the PWS.  Capability statements of up to 15 pages in length may be submitted to the contracting officer, Timothy Inman, 3CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Elmendorf AFB, AK  99506, and are requested by 24 September 2002.

<DESC>1.	The Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) Joint Program Office  intends to issue a production contract to procure the next generation Anti-Jam Antenna System.  The system will consist of a small antenna with four to seven elements referred to as a Small Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (SCRPA) and an electronics control unit referred to as a Digital Antenna Electronics (DAE).  
It is anticipated that an RFP will be released in 2Q FY03.  Source selection will be based on written proposals for the DAE and SCRPA and a test sample for the DAE.  The DAE test sample will be evaluated by the government beginning in 4Q FY03.  Contract award is projected for 2Q FY04 with deliveries 12 months after receipt of order.   It is anticipated that six DAE and four SCRPA First Articles will be procured initially; subsequently, there will be four one-year production options planned which will bring the total number of systems to approximately 869 DAEs and 624 SCRPAs.
The DAE shall incorporate advanced digital signal processing techniques to provide enhanced interference suppression in the Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 and L2 frequency bands.  The DAE shall be capable of modifying the quiescent antenna pattern of the CRPA or SCRPA to create nulls or null regions in the direction of spatially distributed interference sources within the GPS frequency bands.  It shall be capable of autonomously steering a single antenna beam with increased gain in a direction normal to the plane of the CRPA/SCRPA in the hemisphere above the CRPA/SCRPA under static conditions to aid in initial GPS receiver signal acquisition.  The DAE shall be compatible with the proposed GPS Modernization M-Code signal. 
The DAE shall be a drop-in replacement for the current GAS-1 AE with existing electrical and mechanical interfaces to CRPAs, GPS receivers, and Host Vehicles.    It shall be capable of operating with the seven element CRPA LRU as specified in CI-GAS-1/CRPA-300B as well as the four to seven element SCRPA being produced under this program.   It is desirable that it operates with other existing seven element CRPAs within the military inventory.  
The SCRPA shall be a seven-element antenna with a footprint of seven inches square and one and a half inches high (or less).  A potential variant is a four element SCRPA with a footprint of 4.68 inches square and 1.25 inches high, which is the size of the Fixed Reception Pattern antenna (FRPA).
Interested parties are invited to submit a Statement Of Capability (SOC).  The SOC shall not exceed ten pages.  Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration on each of the following qualifications: (1) Experience: An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed and any in-house research and development effort, (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientist, engineers, and technical personnel who may be assigned as a principal investigator and/or project officer, (3) Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration, (4) A statement regarding industry security clearance, and (5) Any other specific information that would enhance our evaluation.
The SOC is due 30 days from the date of this announcement. The government will use this SOC to determine if there is sufficient interest in the marketplace from qualified sources to attempt full and open competition. 
The Government does not intend to award any contract as a result of, or pay any costs associated with, submittal of information solicited herein.  The SOC and all related communications that contain proprietary information should be marked as such.  An Ombudsman, Mr William Orzech, at (310) 363-0588, has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman isnot to diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. 
See Note 26.

<DESC>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is in the process in determining industry interest and capabilities for an upcoming solicitation to be released in the near future.  You are requested to review the information below.  Those companies that have interest in this project are requested to send a letter of interest, outlining their capabilities, business size, HUB Zone applicablity, to the Contracting Offiver, Craig S. Segall, by COB 8/9/02.  Interested parties should respond to the following e-mai laddress:  CSSegall@atfhq.atf.treas.gov.  Three is no solicitation available at this point, nor is a draft solicitation available.  ATF contemplates awarding a contract by 12/1/02.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) is a law enforcement organization within the United States Department of the Treasury with a unique combination of responsibilities dedicated to reducing violent crime, collecting revenue, and protecting the public. A key component of ATF?s arsenal of crime fighting weapons is its Office of Laboratory Services that provides advisory and scientific forensic support services. These facilities located in Washington, D.C., Walnut Creek, California and Atlanta, Georgia provide unparalleled scientific expertise and technical support for criminal investigations conducted under ATF?s jurisdiction. 

The new Fire Research Laboratory (FRL) will conduct forensic research, case support, training and education for fire investigation and analysis for ATF Certified Fire Investigators (CFIs), prosecutors, and the fire investigation community at-large. The FRL will provide fire scientists, engineers, researchers and investigators with the capability to perform a wide range of standard and unique tests. These potential tests range from small-scale fire tests to full-scale testing of entire residential structures. The FRL will have several large test cells (rooms) where full-scale test fires will be conducted. This unique capability will provide ATF the versatility necessary to reconstruct and test key aspects of most of the fire scenarios encountered by fire investigators in the field. 

The FRL will qualitatively study fire phenomena with regard to fire origin, growth, and spread in order to support the investigation of fires to accurately determine their origin and cause. To accomplish this mission, the FRL requires technical support services to supervise and direct skilled tradesmen in the fabrication of structural models / test assemblies of various sizes and scales from commercial building materials and supplies to recreate the physical conditions of various fire scenarios for laboratory analysis and validation. These services will be performed at the new ATF National Laboratory and Fire Research Center located in Beltsville, Maryland.

OBJECTIVE/SCOPE OF WORK

The contractor shall provide technical support services Monday through Friday, excepting federal holidays, eight hours per day, 40 hours per week for all services necessary to facilitate preparation, fabrication, maintenance and fire testing of structural models / test assemblies and equipment under laboratory conditions at the FRL. In some instances, these support services may require part-time flexible work schedules on an as needed basis that will be specified by the Government. Technical support services shall include all activities necessary to provide and supervise a skilled workforce of competent tradesmen to conduct test cell and associated systems maintenance, test model fabrication, model pre-test preparation and wiring, post-test maintenance/clean-up, and equipment installation, maintenance, repair and calibration. The contractor?s workforce shall exhibit a broad knowledge of general construction and building design principles and practices; specifically to include, but not limited to carpentry, electrical systems, electronics (component and instrument repair/maintenance), sheet metal, plumbing, and welding. The Contractor shall alsosupply additional technical resources (skills, materials, or equipment) for situations that involve unique test scenarios, as required by the Government. 

The Contractor shall be responsible for providing the resources necessary to accomplish the following specific tasks:

?	Fabrication and construction of test articles of varying sizes, structural modifications to existing test articles, fabrication of test components, installation of wiring, carpeting, insulation, interior furnishings and other items as specified in laboratory test plans. 

?	On-site assembly of pre-fabricated test articles (e.g., modular homes) in accordance with manufacturer supplied design and construction documents. 

?	Installation and modification of test cell instruments to include temperature / measurement devices (such as thermocouples and heat flux transducers), smoke meters, pressure transducers, gas analyzers, smoke detectors, infrared detectors, video cameras, tubing, filters and associated wiring necessary to measure fire test conditions within the test cell. 

?	Installation, calibration, repair and replacement of instrumentation installed in the measurement hoods in each test cell. Maintenance and repair includes tasks such as, but not limited to, servicing, removing and replacing readily available and accessible defective components in accordance with equipment manufacturer?s recommended maintenance schedules and instructions supplied to the Contractor by the government. The instrumentation consists of ductwork assemblies equipped with gas sampling probes (analyzers) to record carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) concentrations.

?	Maintenance and/or replacement of associated measurement equipment such as thermocouples (with government furnished equipment such as a thermocouple welder) and heat flux transducers as required. Routine maintenance may include replacing components of the gas analyzers and heat flux transducers when the equipment fails to produce accurate readings.

?	Repair of items / contents, (or assisting FRL staff with the repair of items/contents) such as monitor nozzles, pressure transducers, thermocouples, heat flux transducers, or similar support equipment installed in test cells in the event that they are damaged as a result of fire tests. 

?	Post-test clean-up of test cells that includes the removal of burned materials / debris / residue, sweeping the test area, hosing the test area down with water, and removing the wastewater to substantially return the test cell to its pre-fire condition. 

?	An Inventory Management System (IMS) and an Approved Purchasing System (APS) capable of monitoring, ordering and tracking construction materials / building supplies.

<SUBJECT>Notice of intent to enter into transportation and processing agreements for oil and natural gas
<DESC>The U.S. Minerals Management Service, under its Royalty in Kind program, is chartered to sell the Government's royalty share of certain oil and natural gas assets produced on lands of the United States in a manner consistent with established industry practice. From time to time it is advantageous to transport the product to market centers or to process natural gas prior to offering it for sale. No funds appropriated by Congress are available for this purpose, but Public Law 106-291 permits the use of revenues under the Royalty in Kind program to pay for these services. This posting will serve as notice of the intent and methodology to enter into such agreements. When analysis shows that transportation or processing agreements would be advantageous to the Government, the Minerals Management Service will conduct market research to identify potential sources. When more than one potential source is identified the Minerals Management Service will seek competitive offers from capable sources. In many instances, only one source for the services will be available, e.g. when only one pipeline exists for transport, or when only one processing plant is within the transport stream. In those cases the Minerals Management Service will negotiate favorable prices and terms with the single source. Since the Royalty in Kind program is expected to embrace established commercial practices, the Minerals Management Service intends to use contract practice and formats common to the industry. No public announcements will be made for individual actions since it is expected that staff research and knowledge of the industry will identify all reasonably available sources. Comments or notices of interest may be directed to the Royalty in Kind Contracting Officer, Terry Grush at the above address or at terry.grush@mms.gov.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation is a Request for Proposal and the number is PC-02-R-002. This solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-08.
1. BACKGROUND: Sexual assault is a devastating event for a Peace Corps Volunteer (PCV)  to endure. In addition to physical injury, it is frequently associated with substantial psychological and social sequela that persists  long after the actual assault.  In 1999 alone there were 28 reported major sexual assaults among Volunteers.   Ten of the 28 were completed rapes.  Of these 10 rapes, 6 were ?acquaintance? rapes in which the assailant is known to the victim.  This is probably a minimum estimate because studies have found that acquaintance rape is under-reported to a greater extent than stranger rape.  The epidemiology of sexual assault among PCVs is similar to that found on college campuses where more than 80% of rapes are committed by a known assailant.  Although overall the number of assaults in all  three regions is showing a downward trend,  the incidence of sexual assault is distributed unequally with most occurring in the Inter-America / Pacific Region.  The problem continues to be prevalent and threatening to all Volunteers, especially females. 
Final Product:  The video will be used for the training and education of Peace Corps Volunteers and Trainees.  The broad goal of the video is to stimulate group discussion related to maintaining personal safety and security while serving in a foreign country.  
The 20 minute video should feature 4 interviews.  Three with survivors (self-selected Returned Peace Corps Volunteers) narrating their experiences and advice in response to an off screen therapist interviewer.  The fourth interview will be with a key Peace Corps staff member who has participated in the care of a sexual assault victim in a foreign country with the goal of offering insights on Peace Corps? management strategy and support for the Volunteer.  The video will be punctuated with background roll and voice narration of Peace Corps sexual assault  statistics and information for the audience.
2. SCOPE OF WORK: The Contractor will write the script with the concurrence of the Office of Medical Services (OMS) lead staff person on the project.  The Contractor will produce, direct and videotape on location (domestic).  The Contractor will edit the final version.  The Contractor shall write the script based on the guidance of OMS incorporating all objectives and goals in the product.  The training video will use dramatization, interview and other creative approaches to illustrate the points. 
The Peace Corps will provide meeting space during consultations on the project.  Access to the telephone, copy machine and fax will also be provided.
3. PROGRAM CONCEPTS AND TARGET AUDIENCE:
Title: TBA
Format:The program will be shot and mastered on Betacam SP.  Peace Corps is responsible for duplication and distributing VHS dubs and training manual to in-country training staff. Length: Approximately 20 minutes.
Audience: The video is intended for all Peace Corps Trainees and Volunteers.  This group includes both sexes, varied ages, ethnic and educational backgrounds, and levels of work experience.
Use: The video will be used primarily during Pre-Service Training.  It will educate Trainees on the risk of sexual assault, and provide them with strategies to prevent sexual assault.  The discussion of sexual assault should emphasize, but not be limited to rape.  

Objectives: The video will inform Peace Corps Trainees and Volunteers about the known risk of sexual assault using statistics and data from the Office of Medical Services,  ?Sexual Assault? study.  Through interviews, the video will highlight these risks, promote strategies and best practices to prevent an assault,  and explain the Peace Corps system response should an assault occur. 
The primary focus of  the video is to;
?increase the awareness of sexual assault and rape
?provide information about risk factors for sexual assault
?communicate strategies for prevention.  
The secondary focus is to; 
?inform Trainees and Volunteers about Peace Corps' support for victims of sexual
assault, both at post and in Washington. 
The tone of the video will be serious but not defeating.   The video will leave the viewer with a sense that there are real risks of sexual assault, and that there are important actions one can take to reduce the risk of becoming a victim.  The viewer will recognize that the cross-cultural aspects of Peace Corps service create risks of assault that may not have existed in the U.S.   The viewer will also recognize that Peace Corps supports the victim of a assault in an effective, compassionate manner.  The video should include interviews with Volunteers who have been assaulted.  This technique is very effective in capturing the attention of Trainees and personalizing for them the risks of sexual assault.    
Goals:The broad goal of the video is to reduce the incidence of risk- taking behavior and ultimately sexual assault among Peace Corps Volunteers.
1.Provide Trainees with information on the incidence of sexual assault, and the risk
factors for sexual assault among Peace Corps Volunteers. 
2.Increase the awareness of risk and risk behaviors, and make these risks real through
the stories and experiences of other Volunteers or RPCVs.
3.Illustrate the importance of risk reduction and self-protection.
4.Address cross-cultural issues and perceptions as they pertain to sexual assault.  
5.Give Trainees and Volunteers strategies for minimizing their risk
6.Introduce peer and staff support systems that can help Trainees and Volunteers stay
safe.  
7.Describe Peace Corps' support system in response a sexual assault.

<DESC>&#65279; This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with
the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with
additional information included in this notice. The announcement constitutes the only
solicitation; bids are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This
solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) #0033752, the provisions and
clauses incorporated are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2000-07.
This solicitation is under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a Small Business -
Small Purchase Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is
335129, and the Business Size Standard is 500 employees. This will be a Firm-Fixed price
contract for seventy (70) forensic alternate light source (ALS) units with the following minimum
specifications: Design /Construction and Weight: The equipment shall be portable, compact and
substantial enough to sustain the rigors of transport in a vehicle as well as aboard commercial
aircraft.  Lightweight equipment less than  thirty-five (35) pounds, self-contained in a durable
sturdy carrying case with heavy duty lockable closures is required. There shall be one or more
carrying handles which fold flat or into a recess.   The equipment shall be shipped as baggage in
the shipping baggage department or as carry-on luggage in the overhead compartment as
necessary.  The ability to mount the equipment on a tripod is not required but desired. External
Fixtures: External fixtures to include latches, handle(s), controls, fittings, etc. shall be substantial
enough to sustain the rigors of transport in a vehicle as well as encounters during shipping in
commercial transport.  Internal design/construction shall be secure and not easily disconnected or
dislodged to allow malfunction.  Any color type product is acceptable, except the product shall
not be highly reflective or brightly colored.  Carry-On and Baggage Shipment: The carrying case
shall be capable of being shipped as a carry-on in the overhead compartment, and as baggage in
the baggage department of an aircraft, etc., and shall contain the ALS and all the accessories
necessary for operation of the equipment.  A sturdy, durable exterior carrying case is required to
withstand the rigors of transport.  The maximum exterior dimensions of this configuration are set
forth below under Dimensions and Portability.  The carrying case containing the ALS will be
subjected to an impact test wherein it will be dropped from a loading deck onto an asphalt
surface (approximately thirty-two (32) inches high), followed by a basic functionality test of the
ALS.  Wavelengths:  The light source must employ multiple user selectable (tunable) visible
wavelengths, at least one broad bandwidth and several narrow bandwidths, controlled by a
durable internally mounted filter system (rather than separate user changeable filters needed to
produce each individual wavelength).  The wavelength in use must be easily determined by an
indicator system, such as a digital readout. Lamp:  The light source (lamp) must be a high
intensity (350 watts or greater) light with an extended life [fifty (50) hours minimum] capable
of producing light in the visible and ultra-violet ranges.  Specifically, wavelengths required
will include:  ultra-violet capability (300 to 400 nm) and several (4 or 5) visible wavelengths
(400 to 600 nm).  The lamp(s) must be capable of being changed with minimum effort
requiring a minimal number of tools not limited to or specific to the unit/manufacturer (e.g.
common screwdriver(s), wrench(es), plier(s), etc.).  At least two lamps must be supplied with
the unit: the operational lamp in the unit and a single extra replacement lamp with storage of
the replacement lamp within the carrying case preferred; Light Transmission:   The light
transmission shall be via a flexible cable (liquid and/or fiber optic light guide) at least two (2)
meters in length and substantial enough to withstand normal rigors of crime scene use (being
accidentally stepped on, etc.).  The cable/light guide must be capable of supporting the use of
white light for extended periods of time and must be storable within the carrying case of the
unit.  A single cable for use with all supplied wavelengths is desired, however, if separate
cables/light guides are necessary for visible and ultra violet, respectively, both must meet the
above requirements of size, sturdiness and storability within the shipping/carrying case.  The
unit must be supplied with a power cord of reasonable length (3 meters minimum). A power
converter will be required for overseas use and may be separate or built in (preferred).  If
separate, it must fit within the carrying case. Dimensions and Portability: The outside
dimensions of the carrying case (containing the ALS) shall not exceed, 20 inches long by 12
inches wide by 12 inches high with an aggregate of not more than 44 inches and no one
dimension exceeding 20 inches to include handles, latches and fixtures (such as controls, fittings
and indicator lights/devices) attached and/or integral to the unit.  The light transmission cable
shall be a minimum of two (2) meters in length.  This cable shall be storable within the carrying
case of the product.  The power cord must not be less than three (3) meters in length.  If
detachable, it must be storable within the carrying case.  If the power cord is an integral part of
the unit, it must be securable to prevent damage.  Note:  Transport of the carrying case and the
ALS may often be by shipping in packing crates/cases, separately on commercial air travel or
carried in a truck/crime scene vehicle which may or may not be well padded.  The product shall
have ease of handling and carrying for extended periods of time. Ease of Use:  The product must
be simple to operate, the light source easily changed (not requiring tools or extensive
disassembly) and simple to calibrate if calibration is necessary before each use.  The light
source/cable must be capable of supporting the use of white light for extended periods of time.
The ALS equipment will be used primarily for crime scene use and not as a stationary unit in an
evidence room or laboratory.  Accordingly a compact, easily handled ALS is desired.  The ALS
shall be ?user-friendly? and simple to operate with instructions that allow a full range of use
with a reasonable amount of study with little or no requirement for calibration before use.  The
ALS shall have an easily understood control panel with an easily read wavelength indicator; 
 Training on the offered equipment must be provided by the contractor. Sample units will be
accepted from offerors. The following FAR clauses are incorporated by reference and apply to
this acquisition: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items. (OCT 2000); 52.212-4
