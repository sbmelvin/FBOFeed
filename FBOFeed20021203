<DESC>Overview

This is a Request for Information (RFI) in support of the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) Information Technology (IT) competitive sourcing study being conducted under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 and Supplemental Handbook (hereinafter referred to collectively as OMB Circular A-76). 

The DoDEA IT activity encompasses four regions:  DoDEA Headquarters located in Arlington, VA (hereinafter DoDEA HQ), Department of Defense Elementary and Secondary Schools (regional headquarters located in Atlanta, GA and schools located throughout the southeastern United States as well as New York, Puerto Rico and Guam) (hereinafter DDESS), Department of Defense Dependent Schools-Europe (DoDDS-Europe) (regional headquarters located in Wiesbaden, Germany and K-12 schools located throughout Europe), Department of Defense Dependent Schools-Pacific (DoDDS-Pacific) (regional headquarters located in Okinawa, Japan and K-12 schools located in Japan and Korea) (hereinafter collectively referred to as regions).  The regions require IT services and Administrative Technology (AT) support services at both educational and administration locations worldwide.

The type of services that will be required of the successful Service Provider (SP) include: 

?	Technical support and advice for all worldwide DoDEA schools, district offices, area offices, headquarters offices and related facility administrative and data processing systems
?	Perform DoDEA network installation, administration, upgrading, maintenance and troubleshooting on Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), Campus Area Network (CAN) and Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
?	Perform workstation installation, administration, maintenance, upgrading and troubleshooting
?	Provide direction and advice to administrative and educational staff at DoDEA sites
?	Serve as network administrator at DoDEA sites
?	Assist in planning for future development of worldwide DoDEA schools and facilities
?	Ensure coordination with all other DoDEA IT support personnel.

 

Specific request for information

DoDEA requests that industry carefully review the draft PWS and offer comments.  Comments that do not include a reference to the applicable portion of the draft PWS may not be considered.  In preparing the Performance Work Statement and other solicitation documentation for the A-76 study, the government is requesting input from all interested parties in the following areas:

Scope of the study

The current study encompasses work wide performance of IT and AT services.  They government is requesting input from all interested parties on the benefits and/or risks associated with an approach that contemplates both an option to perform a signgle provider cost comparison for the entire requirement as well as an option to conduct four separate cost comparisons for DoDEA HQ, DoDDS-Europe, Dodds-Pacific and DDESS.  Please provide comments on the use of the following process:

To accommodate the complex nature of this study and to afford a competitive opportunity to all commercial entities to include small businesses, the function under study has been divided into four regional requirements (DoDEA HQ, DoDDS-Europe, DoDDS-Pacific, DDESS).  However, because the intent of performing a commercial activity study is to gain the maximum attainable cost and performance efficiencies for the function under study, the government may also consider a single service provider for the entire IT function.  For these reasons the Government is considering the following two approaches to this study.

The first approach requires that the Government Management Plan (GMP) team prepare a management plan and an In-House Cost Estimate (IHCE) for the Most Efficient Organization (MEO) that supports the primary approach of a separate service providers a for each of the four regions.  Secondly, the GMP team will prepare a management plan and an IHCE for an alternative single service provider (one service provider for all regions performing under a single contract).  All management plans (for the regional approach and the single service provider consolidated approach) will be sealed by the contracting officer.

Industry offers will be solicited to support each of the regional requirements.  In addition, industry will be encouraged to submit alternate proposals supporting a single provider approach.  The following statement (or something substantially similar) will be included in the solicitation:

 ?The government intends to either select four individual and independent offers, one for each region, or select a single alternate offer for a consolidated activity, depending upon which scenario offers the best value to the Government cost and performance factors.  Should four independent offers be selected, there will be four independent cost comparisons conducted to evaluate if government MEO performance or industry performance is most advantageous in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 guidelines.  Individual contract awards by region will be made if the industry offers are determined to be most advantageous.?  

If selection of individual offers for each region be determined to offer the best value approach after industry competition, the GMP for each region will be opened and compared to each of the selected industry offers.  If the single consolidated alternative is determined to offer the best value to the government under industry competition, the GMP for a single consolidated function will be opened and compared to the industry offer in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 instructions.

 
Industry days 

The government is contemplating hosting ?industry days? to obtain input from all interested parties as well as to provide further information and insight into the requirements under study.  The government anticipates holding from one to four industry days.  It is anticipated that there will be an industry day held in each of the four regions under study.  Comments on this plan are welcome.

Small business considerations

What could the government do or include in this study/procurement that would provide incentives for small business participation (e.g. contract type, award incentives, performance incentives, or some other type of incentive)? 

Contract types

Understanding that this is an international effort being studied under OMB Circular A-76, what type of contract would you support as being the most appropriate for this effort (i.e. Cost Plus, Fixed Price, Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery, or Hybrid)?

If you believe a hybrid type of contract is most appropriate, please give an example of how you would recommend structuring the contract type.

Transition period

How should the transition period be considered?  Should the government mandate a timeframe for the transition or should offerors be allowed to propose individual transitions?

Should transition be considered part of the selection criteria?

Any personnel appearing to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs or using abusive language shall be replaced with qualified personnel for completion of services being performed.

b.  Pre-move Survey.  The contractor shall determine the nature of personal property offered for shipment either by physical inspection or telephone survey with the owner.  The ordering officer may waive this requirement if a survey is not desired by the owner or if the ordering officer deems it unnecessary or impractical.

(1)	A physical inspection shall be accomplished for all shipments which 
are being picked up from a residence with an estimated net weight of 3,200 pounds or more reflected on the DD Form 1299, Application for Shipment and/or Storage of Personal Property.  For shipments of lesser weight, a telephone premove survey shall be made.

(2)	The physical premove survey shall be conducted at a time and date, 
which is mutually agreed upon between the contractor and the owner but not later than the day prior to the scheduled pack, or pickup date.

c.  Weighing.

(1)	The gross, tare, and net weight of all shipments shall be determined
through use of the contractor's warehouse platform scales, Government scales, or public truck scales.  Each scale used must be properly certified by a state inspector of weights and measures in accordance with the regulations of the state or district having legal jurisdiction over the scales.  Personnel designated to operate scales shall be licensed or otherwise qualified as weigh masters if required by the applicable state, commonwealth, or district.

(2)	When scales are not available or their use is not practical, the 
application of a constructive weight or seven (7) pounds per cubic foot will be used provided prior written approval is obtained from the ordering officer.  

(3)	When available and within a reasonable distance from the pickup or 
delivery location, the ordering officer will require the use of Government scales.  

(4)	Except as otherwise provided herein, the weight of each shipment shall
be obtained by determining the difference between the tare weight of the vehicle on which the shipment is to be loaded prior to the loading and the weight of the vehicle with the shipment loaded.

(5)	At the time of the tare and gross weighing, the vehicle shall have 
installed or loaded thereon all pads, dollies, hand trucks, ramps and other equipment required for the transportation of such shipments.  No packing or crating materials or supplies shall be loaded on the vehicle at the time of the tare weighing.  Neither the driver nor any other persons shall be on the vehicle at the time of either the tare or the gross weighing.

(6)	The fuel tanks on the vehicle shall be full at the time of each weighing 
or, in the alternative, no fuel may be added between the two weighings when the tare weighing is the first weighing performed.

(7)	The trailer of a tractor-trailer vehicle combination shall be detached 
from the tractor and the trailer weighed separately at each weighing providing the length of the scale platform is adequate to accommodate and support the entire trailer at one time.

(8)	When professional books, papers, and equipment (PBP&E) are 
included as part of the shipment, including those packed by owner, the weight of each item individually described on the inventory shall be entered on the same line of the inventory next to the description.  The total weight of such articles shall be annotated separately on the inventory and packing list.  The PBP&E weight will be obtained using bathroom or platform type scales.  If it is not possible or practical for the contractor to weigh the items at the time of packing and pickup, a constructive weight of 40 pounds per cubic foot will be used for PBP&E.

(9)	The contractor shall invoice for the net weight of all shipments.  

(10) The contractor shall submit weight tickets, reflecting gross, tare and
net weight, in duplicate, properly certified in accordance with ICC, state, commonwealth or district regulations to the ordering officer with applicable documentation.  

(11) The weight tickets shall contain the name and address of the 
weighing station, the date, name of contractor, van or trailer number, name of property owner, applicable call number assigned by the ordering officer, and signature of the weighmaster.

(12) Billing Procedures.  Shipments are payable on the basis of a 500-
pound minimum weight.

Such documents include, but are not limited to: (1)  Record of Categorical Exclusions (RCE), Environmental Assessments (EAs) and Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) in conformance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality that implement NEPA procedures, 40 C.F.R. Parts 1500-1508; (2) Documents required for consistency determination under the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA); (3) Documents for consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act Regulations (PL 101-601) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966; (4) Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans (INRMP) as required by the Sikes Act Improvement Amendments of 1997 and associated NEPA documentation in accordance with Memorandum from the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Installation and Environment) of 12 Aug 98. Technical services may include preliminary site assessment studies (including topographic, geotechnical, hazardous materials, and infrastructure) associated with the  proposed action, civil engineering services, feasibility assessments, and supporting studies on physical, biological, electromagnetic, radio frequency interference, traffic, economic, social and other components of the environment which may be affected by the proposed action. Other technical services may include graphics, preparation of presentation and briefing materials (in electronic format and hard copies), and coordination with government agencies. The contract scope may require evaluation of and definition  of asbestos materials, toxic waste disposition and/or pollution control works. If asbestos or hazardous materials exist, the A-E contractor may be required to identify, evaluate and recommend alternative methods for disposal in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. Firms must be prepared to accept the aforementioned as a part of their contract responsibility.  Project assignments may include projects for governmental agencies other than the U.S. Navy, such as the U.S. Coast Guard or the U.S. Marine Corps, for which PACNAVFACENGCOM may be tasked to provide environmental documents.  Many military areas of work anticipated under this contract will not allow the entry of aliens.  The field crew of the A-E shall be composed of U.S. citizens who can qualify for access to military areas after appropriate security checks are made.  The A-E shall abide by prevailing security requirements during visits to such military property and shall obtain the required permits and passes in a timely manner.  The nature of specific work assignments may require the A-E to obtain a secret security clearance.  The Government utilizes the following software suite:  Microsoft WINDOWS NT 4.0/5.0 WORKSTATION, Microsoft OFFICE 2000 PROFESSIONAL (WORD 2000, POWERPOINT 2000, EXCEL 2000, ACCESS 2000), and Internet Explorer 5.5.  In preparation of documents and correspondence, the A-E shall ensure compatibility with the Government?s software.  The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type where the work will be required on an "as needed" basis during the life of the contract provided the Government and contractor agree on the amount. Each project contract will be a firm fixed-price A-E Task Order. The Government will determine the task order amount by using rates negotiated and negotiate the effort required to perform the particular project. The contract shall not exceed twelve months or $1,250,000 total fee, whichever comes first.  The Government guarantees a minimum amount of $25,000 for the contract. Should an impasse on price occur over the initial and subsequent projects, the Government  will apply the dollar value of the Government estimate for that project or projects towards the minimum guarantee. The Government reserves the option to extend the contract for an additional three (3) years for a total of four (4) years, with a maximum fee of $1,250,000 per year. There will be no future synopsis in the event the options included in the contract is exercised. Estimated date of contract award is on or about May 2003. The selected A-E may be required to participate in a pre-fee meeting within seven days of notification and to provide a fee proposal within ten days afterwards. Proposals may be subject to an advisory audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. The following selection evaluation criteria, in relative order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of A-E firms: (1) Professional qualifications of the firm and staff proposed for preparing environmental impact documents in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality that implement NEPA procedures, 40 C.F.R.

IN BLOCK 10 OF THE SF 255 AND ANY ADDENDUM, STATE WHY YOUR FIRM IS SPECIALLY QUALIFIED BASED ON EACH OF THE ABOVE EVALUATION CRITERIA. FOR SELECTION CRITERIA (2), PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION FOR ONLY THE STAFF PROPOSED FOR THIS WORK USING THESE COLUMN HEADINGS: "NAME", "RELATED PROJECTS WORKED ON", "YEAR", "FIRM" AND "TECHNICAL ROLE".

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research related to basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines and novel therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and improvements in public health.  As a part of the research program to improve defense against bioterrorism and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases, the NIAID seeks to establish an Administrative Center in support of the NIAID Proteomics Research Program, being solicited under a separate RFP (see RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-38).  The Proteomics Research Program shall focus on early stage basic research for target discovery and identification and early validation studies.  The subject solicitation is being issued as a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  See Government-wide Numbered Note 1.  As assistance to the Proteomics Research Program, the Administrative Center will: 1) Design, develop, and maintain a publicly accessible website that contains the data and technology protocols generated by each Proteomics Research site, as well as a catalog of reagents and products developed by the sites and available for public distribution; 2) Monitor and facilitate the deposition of reagents and protein targets generated by the Proteomics Research sites.  It is anticipated that the Proteomics sites will deposit their reagents/products to a centralized repository such as the Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research Resource, a new program that will be supported by a separate NIAID contract for distribution to the broader research community; 3) In conjunction with the Project Officer, establish a Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) composed of leading scientists knowledgeable in a broad range of proteomics and bioinformatic research areas.  The committee members shall also include individuals with expertise in microbiology, immunology (both innate and adaptive immunity), and infectious diseases.  The committee shall provide advice to the NIAID on the operations and future directions of the Proteomics Centers program based on the state of proteomic technological and research advances, including those contributed by the Proteomics Centers; and 4) Organize programmatic meetings and other related activities involving all of the Proteomics Research Program sites.  It is anticipated that one (1) cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded, with a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately September 2003.  RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-45 will be available electronically on or about December 13, 2002, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>NIAID is establishing a Broad Agency Agreement (BAA) to solicit proposals to address the Institute's need for research programs focused on the discovery of targets for potential candidates for the next generation of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics against microorganisms considered agents of bioterrorism or responsible for emerging and/or re-emerging diseases using proteomic technologies.  The research programs shall be focused on NIAID category A-C pathogens and microorganisms responsible for emerging and/or re-emerging diseases found at NIAID web site http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/bioterrorism/bandc_priority.htm.  The primary goal of these programs is to characterize the pathogen and/or host cell proteome, identifying proteins associated with the biology of the microbes, mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis, innate and adaptive immune responses to infectious agents, and/or non-immune mediated host responses that contribute to microbial pathogenesis.  It is anticipated that the research programs will discover targets for potential candidates for the next generation of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics using existing proteomics technologies, augmentation of existing technologies, and/or the creation of novel proteomics approaches and performing early stage validation of these targets.  It is anticipated that five (5) to ten (10) cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded, each with a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately September 2003.

<SUBJECT>B -- B: Bulgaria: Unified Revenue Agency (URA) Information Technology System Technical Assistance
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-0270053A
<RESPDATE>010603
<ARCHDATE>01212003
<CONTACT>Evangela  Kunene, Procument Data Manager, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email ekunene@tda.gov
<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place:  Ms. Maria Murgina, Deputy General Tax Director, General Tax Directorate, Ministry of Finance, 52 Kniaz Dondulkov Blvd., 1504 Sofia, Bulgaria, Ph: 359-2-9859-3005, Fax: 359-2-987-1995.  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Technical Assistance project on the development of information technology (IT) components of a Unified Revenue Agency (URA) for the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in Bulgaria. 

Currently, the collection of tax contributions in Bulgaria is left to voluntary compliance by taxpayers. In 2000, enforcement functions of the Tax Administration Unit under the MOF were reduced to the collections of short-term public arrears only, and the collection of long-term arrears were transferred to the Agency for Public Collections. Since this Agency is still taking shape, the arrears collections have been going down. Another problem in the Bulgarian tax administration is that enterprises and self-employed individuals must submit separate reports to the Tax Administration, National Social Security Institute (NSSI), and several other government agencies. This system is not automated, which creates cumbersome and time-consuming duplication of data entry and a waste of resources. In addition, enterprises are not required by law to declare either wages paid or the tax contributions paid on behalf of each employee. This creates significant potential for fraud in the system. 

For several years, international donors have been helping the government improve its tax administration system, and the proposed URA is the ultimate result of these efforts. The URA is being designed to improve the quality of services to taxpayers and the enforcement of tax legislation. This will create a single point of payment for taxpayers, and will link the disbursements of social security benefits with tax payments. 

The World Bank supports the establishment of the URA, has started preparing a loan of about $45 million to support its development and has provided grant funding to develop Information Systems Architecture for the URA. Deloitte & Touche (D&T) was hired to develop this Architecture, which was completed in February 2002.  The report analyzed several options for the development of the URA.   

The report recommends several Quick Wins?steps that could be taken quickly and cheaply and would bring rapid benefits. This proposed USTDA assistance assumes that the government will take these steps itself without the help of external consultants. 

In addition, to the Quick Wins, the D&T study has recommended Strategic Projects, which are defined as large-scale initiatives that would solve critical IT issues. These projects are classified into three categories: 1) Application and Data Projects?to deal with the procurement and implementation of an integrated tax management software; 2) Technology Projects?to work on improvements in the NSSI?s existing technology infrastructure; and 3) Information Systems (IS) Organization Projects?which deal with the organizational and security issues involved with the establishment of the URA. 

The MOF has already started to address several action items of the above three categories using its own staff, as well as with World Bank and government resources. One local firm has been hired to develop an organizational and operational manual, and the NSSI staff has begun to fully develop the Technology Projects category. Two key items are left uncovered?the identification and procurement of the tax management software, and the development of the IS security concept and its requirements. At this time, neither the MOF nor the World Bank has the funding or skills to undertake these two areas, and therefore both have welcomed USTDA?s assistance.  The proposed Technical Assistance with these two areas will help the MOF accelerate the implementation of the URA and the World Bank loan.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $169,752 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., January 6, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor(s) shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The Contractor(s) proposals and plans may become a part of the contract upon the decision to award.  Past Performance information from potential offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  No offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.  Utility System being privatized are described as follows:  

INSTALLATION AND UTILITY SYSTEMS DESCRIPTIONS: 
 
Electrical Distribution System: Fort Gordon owns an electric distribution system consisting of: approximately 66 circuit miles of 12.47/4.16 kV overhead power distribution lines; approximately 15.7 circuit miles of 12.47/4.16 kV underground distribution lines; approximately 34 circuit miles of overhead/ underground street lighting circuits; and portions of two power distribution substations.  The Main Substation has two each Georgia Power Company (GPC) owned 20 MVA transformers (115/12.47 kV).  The Army owns the low-side equipment that includes one 1200 amp, 12.47 kV circuit breaker and one 12.5 MVA transformer (12.47/4.16 kV). The Army has two bus voltage levels in the Main Substation; i.e., 12.47 kV and 4.16 kV. On the 4.16 kV side there are five 600-amp circuit breakers and on the 12.47 kV side there are fourteen 1200 amp circuit breakers.  The Hospital Substation has one GPC owned 5 MVA transformer (115/12.47 kV).  The Army owns the low side equipment that includes a 1,000-kVA regulator and three 1200 amp circuit breakers.  Fort Gordon currently purchases electrical power from the Georgia Power Company (GPC).  The electric system at Ft. Gordon receives 115 kV primary input at two jointly owned and operated substations that provide electrical power to the entire military facility. GPC provides single 115 kV transmission feeders to each of the substations and GPC owns the high side transformers and protection equipment in each substation. GPC metering equipment is also installed at each location.  Ft. Gordon has installed a lineup of nine 1.5 MW diesel generators near the Main Substation. The generators produce approximately 13.5 MW of power for peak load service. A bus modification was made at the Main Substation to accommodate the peak generation input. The diesel generators require manual start up and manual switching to tie into the Main Substation bus. These diesel generator facilities are not included in this inventory.  The line of demarcation is the connection at the three transformers at the 13.5 MW generator site.  The electric distribution system at Fort Gordon was initially constructed in the 1941 - 42 period. The distribution system has been revised from time to time to accommodate load requirements. The present electrical network consists of both overhead and underground circuits. The overhead circuits are installed on single wood poles with conventional type insulators installed on upswept pins or on wood cross-arms. Pole mounted distribution transformers are installed near individual load centers. The average age of overhead facilities is about 30 years. The underground portion of the electrical network consists of both duct bank installations and direct buried power cables. Pad mounted distribution transformers are installed near load centers. The average age of the underground portion system is about 25 years.  The electrical distribution system at the Fort Gordon recreation area is a 13,800/7,980-volt, 3 phase, 4 wire, wye, grounded system and includes distribution to sewage lift station. Fort Gordon currently purchases electrical power from the Georgia Power Company (GPC) for the recreation area.

This requirement is unrestricted.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered. Interested sources should contact Sherry Anderson at (703) 767-8127 to be added to our bidder mailing list (via e-mail, see below.)  A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance on the Internet at the below listed link URL.  The solicitation will be available on or about August 15, 2001.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a follow-on announcement to three synopses that MARAD issued in June, August, and September, and November 2002,   regarding an A-76 cost comparison study of MARAD's NDRF sites at Suisun Bay near Benicia, Calif., James River near Ft. Eustis, Va; and the Neches River, near Beaumont, Texas.   

The A-76 study will review the operations at the NDRF sites to determine the least costly and most efficient method of operation.  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, "Performance of Commercial Activities", sets forth the general policy of the Government to achieve economy and enhance productivity.  The circular requires Federal agencies to review their commercial activities to determine whether it would be more economical to continue operating them in-house (i.e., with Government employees) or under contract with commercial sources.  The review will be conducted in accordance with Circular A-76 and the revised supplemental handbook.  

This synopsis serves to announce that the MARAD Internet web site now links to the MARAD Reserve Fleet Tech Library.  The link will direct the user to the technical library, which will include, among other documents,  the updated Performance Work Statement, technical exhibits, workload data, layouts of the sites, and Government-furnished property lists.  The site for the manual is:

<DESC>The following questions have been asked by prospective contractors.  Provided are answers to these questions. 1.  Can you send me a spec. sheet on your requirements for molds, such as min. or max. size of eye bolts, do you require cbored water lines? Etc.etc.  We do not have a general spec. sheet for the molds, but all prospective bidders are welcome to visit our shop and see our equipment and how we do things.  General specifications of the molding machine are included in the work statement.  We do not use eyebolts on any of our molds, but if a vendor wants to tap holes for eyebolts for their own handling use, that is not a problem.  As for water lines, we do not require a counterbore. 2.  Is 3D data available for us to build the tools with? 3D data in the form of Solid Edge Version 12 models will be made available to the vendor.  Models will be of the finished p art, with nominal dimensions and no drafted surfaces. 3.  Do you require sign off on all prelim. prints before starting?       No formal signoff process is required. 4.  What type of steels do you want us to use for inserts? base? etc. The work statement requires P-20 for all mold components, but any cores or inserts that need to be hardened should be made of either H-13 or S-7 steel. 5.  Water line dia. min or max?       All water line fittings must be  NPT.   6.  Do you require full 3d prints or detailed prints?    No prints are required. 7.  Gate size, dia, and type.  Or do you require a hot runner system? Hot runners are not required since we are a prototype shop and do only limited production molding.  Gate size and type are part of the mold design, and shall be determined by the vendor, based partially on the resin specified in the work stat ement.

Answer:  Voltages available are: 115V/Single Phase; 208V/3-Phase; 480V/3-Phase.  Breaker rating: 200 amp.
Question 2:  The answer to question 6 states that shielding is required for the equipment, but you do have a shielded room, do you want an additional room for this equipment, or can it be demonstrated in the current room?
Answer:  The X-Ray source, test article, any necessary manipulators, and digital detectors could be in the test bay.  The computer/operator could be located in the shielded control room.  Conduit would be made available to link the two locations.
NOTE:  Response date has not changed.

The purpose of this amendment is threefold: (1) to extend the due date for quotes from 12/4/02 to 12/18/02; (2) to change the sentence near the end of the advertisement from 'This procurement is not set-aside for small business' to 'This procurement is set-aside for small business;' and, (3) to provide a Statement of Work.

BACKGROUND   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disability (NCBDDD) in April 2001, in response to the passage of the Childrens Health Act by the U.S. Congress.  The mission of NCBDDD is to prevent the birth defects and developmental disabilities that we know how to prevent, find causes and develop prevention strategies for those we do not know how to prevent, and to improve the health and wellness of people living with a disability.  NCBDDDs leadership is presently in the process of identifying new programs, preparing important public health messages and recommendations, and selecting persons to manage the day-to-day operations of its two divisions and 10 teams.  Of particular importance is the preparation of written material and oral presentations to explain the activities underway in the Center, past accomplishments and future plans for those activities, and to describe and justify new Center programs.  Assistance is needed to enable these planning and evaluation activities to take place.  Specifically, the following type of help is needed: 1) Educate the general public, health care professionals, and policy makers on issues related to the new Center; 2) Provide advice, participate in the development of, and prepare formal documents on programmatic vision, goals, and plans; and, 3) Help determine how well Center programs are achieving the desired goals and document the results of this evaluation.  II.  PURPOSE   NCBDDD is developing its core capacity to effectively and efficiently describe Center programs and goals and to evaluate how well those goals are achieved.  This requires resource support beyond current capacity.  It also requires the unique skills related to this task order.  The objectives of this task order are to: 1) Develop goals, objectives, and operational and strategic plans for carrying out the mission; 2) Communicate scientific/programmatic goals, objectives, accomplishments, and concerns; 3) Lead preparation of periodic reports and reviews of activities and organizations; and, 4) Lead activities to showcase achievements of current programs and research.

The vendor shall perform the following:  Activity 1) Facilitate the development and presentation of 1-year programmatic and research plans for all NCBDDD organizational units and prepare briefing book outlining such plans for NCBDDD senior management.  Due date: December 30, 2002 for FY03 and November 28, 2003 for FY04; Activity 2) Communicate scientific/programmatic goals, objectives, accomplishments, and concerns to many different groups utilizing many methods (writing speeches, developing Powerpoint presentations, brochures, exhibits, etc.)  Due date: As requested by project officer; Activity 3) Lead preparation of periodic reports and reviews of activities and organizations, including several required reports to Congress.  Due date: Draft reports to project officer as negotiated, with final reports due by November 28, 2003; and, Activity 4) Lead efforts to establish interactive information dissemination and communication network of NCBDDD partners, keeping partners abreast of NCBDDD research results and programmatic achievements, and providing a forum for discussion of mission-related topics.

X.  MINIMUM VENDOR QUALIFICATIONS   1) Vendor shall demonstrate knowledge of NCBDDD, Planning and Evaluation Programs.  While not ABSOLUTELY essential, experience with the issues of birth defects, developmental disabilities, disability and health is an extremely important criteria for assessing possible vendors for this project.  Much of the work will be conducted on an as-needed basis with short turn around times, making a background in the issues very important.  In addition, issues of disability require a great deal of sensitivity in regard to language, in particular related to characterization of health and ability, and developing this sensitivity often requires a significant learning curve.  2) Vendor shall demonstrate ability to work with diverse constituencies, including people with disabilities and organizations that represent people with disabilities.  3) Vendor shall demonstrate flexibility regarding project scheduling in order to facilitate response to emerging and urgent communication requirements.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is interested in partnering through a Space Act Agreement, on a no-cost basis, with a commercial firm that has experience in the replacement of engines and related accessories on aircraft.  The intent is to produce the non-recurring engineering data package and first article prototype of a re-engined HU-25 aircraft such that the modified aircraft can be certified for flight by NASA in the Public Use category.  NASA LaRC will loan an HU-25 (United States Coast Guard version of the Dassault Falcon 20 aircraft) to the commercial partner for them to replace the currently certified engines with different engines acceptable to NASA LaRC, the engines to be provided by the commercial partner, that can be certified for use on the HU-25.  NASA will work with the commercial partner to certify the modified aircraft in the Public Use category.  If all goals are met the following results are expected:  The commercial partner will provide the Government, at no cost to the Government, a Government use data package for the replacement of the engines on the HU-25 with the agreed upon engines.   The loaned HU-25 will be returned to its original condition and returned to NASA LaRC or, if NASA LaRC and the partner can arrive at an acceptable agreement, NASA LaRC may purchase by separate instrument the modifications and have the aircraft returned with the modifications.    The commercial partner will own a proprietary data package that they may sell to non-federal Government users of the Dassault Falcon 20 for replacement of engines.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEE TO COMMERCIALIZE COARSE WAVE DIVISION MULTIPLEXING TECHNOLOGY
<DESC>Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), seeks a licensee to commercialize coarse wave division multiplexing technology using photonic devices.

LLNL has developed technology to permit the construction of an optical networking system which uses parallel optical interconnections using multimode fiber ribbon cable and lowcost M.T. connector compatible elements to broadcast information using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) with a coarse frequency spacing.  This technology involves both individual technologies necessary to make the system work and several system level designs.

LLNL has developed components for use in low cost parallel optical interconnect systems using multi-mode fibers to broadcast WDM channels.  For cost reasons, LLNL?s technologies use multiple frequencies with a wide frequency spacing of 10 nm, so called CWDM or  Coarse Wave Division Multiplexing.

LLNL also has developed the following technology to implement photonic LAN systems.  These technologies include the following:

?	Transmit module designs ? LLNL has developed a byte wide multi-wavelength transmission module which emits on multiple wavelength channels across multiple fibers.  This module uses VCSEL technology (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers).

?	Low loss and small footprint add/drop multiplexers. ? A low-loss routing fabric requires sophisticated add/drop multiplexers.  LLNL has developed such multiplexers using thin film interference filters.

?	CWDM Wavelength Router ? This uses a diffraction grating and broad-band add/drop filters to achieve wavelength reuse.  This design enables a bit-parallel wavelength router by using multiple sets of inputs and outputs.

 
LLNL?s individual technologies are useful for a number of different data transmission topologies.  A system designer can tailor the following types of systems using the system technology described above:

?	High throughput, multi-bit parallel point to point transmission.

?	High throughput, multi-bit parallel transmission with multiple destinations.  (Here, independent channels on different optical wavelengths are simultaneously broadcast to a number of nodes via a star coupler.)

?	A non-blocking crossbar interconnect with source routing.  This system offers wide-bandwidth, single-hop communications for all of the nodes on the network.  Each wavelength provides an independent, concurrent logical bus channel.  With sufficient wavelengths, the system provides a non-blocking crossbar interconnect.  LLNL refers to this system design as the Lambdabus.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's coarse wave division multiplexing technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO00003-03

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's photonic devices and its coarse wave division multiplexing technology.

<SUBJECT>A -- Industry Day for Broad Area Maritime Surveillance UAV Program
<DESC>The Navy Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV) Program Office (PMA263) of the Program Executive Office for Strike Weapons and Unmanned Aviation (PEO (W) is hosting an Industry Day on TUESDAY, 17 DECEMBER 2002, 0900-1630, at the MITRE Corporation facility, MITRE 1 Building, located at 7515 Colshire Drive, McLean, VA 22102 .  The purpose of Industry Day is to provide industry the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) UAV program vision, its acquisition strategy development status, and to obtain industry feedback related to programmatic issues, risks, and schedule.  The Program Office will present various briefings addressing the BAMS UAV Program plan and concepts, its desired warfighting capabilities, and any related program support activities.  The BAMS UAV will provide persistent unmanned, long dwell Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) capability to the warfighter.  Examples of BAMS UAV missions include: ISR queuing, strike support, SIGINT, and communications relay.  It will act as an information collection hub and operate independently or in direct collaboration with other manned, unmanned, and space-based platforms.  Notionally, the Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance (MPR) Force Community will support the BAMS UAV, however BAMS UAV will additionally provide ISR capabilities to the intelligence, surface warfare, amphibious and carrier strike communities.  Additional information related to the BAMS UAV Program, including the proposed industry day agenda and map, can be found at the PMA 263 web site http://uav.navair.navy.mil.

Due to space limitations, attendance to Industry Day is restricted to 2 representatives per company.  Private, one-on-one sessions for mutual exchange of information will be conducted with all interested parties.  Companies requesting private discussions will be limited to one hour per company.  We plan to hold these meetings between 13 - 24 January 2003.  The Navy encourages innovative acquisition strategy approaches to include spiral development, evolutionary acquisition, combined testing, and teaming or partnering with industry or Government.

<SUBJECT>--LAUNDRY SERVICES
<DESC>NA Fort Eustis VA Directorate of Logistics is looking for sources to provide laundry services.  These services would be in the form of bundled laundry bags containing a combination of personal and military (battle dress uniforms known hereafter as BDUs) cloth ing.  We are estimating about 500 bundles per week (the cost will drive this number) with each bundle containing 10 items (including the bag) hollding the items.  Bundles would consist of varying pieces depending on the individuals needs but would probably  contain five personal clothing items and four BDU items.  The BDU (trousers/shirts) items would need to be washed/dried/pressed and starched and then hung on hangers.   The personal clothings items (could be anything from socks and underwear to jeans or d ress shirts)would be washed/dried/folded and placed back in the bag.  All items would be premarked with the individuals names or other identifying information..  Bundles would be picked up from and returned to one central location on the installation.  Wor kload could be staggered so as not to receive all 50 bundles on the same day (unless desired).  Interested sources would have to be able to provide a two day (pick up on Monday return on Wednesday, etc.) turn around to the central location.  It is also pos sible for entire workload to be picked up on Friday and returned on Monday if any potential sources may be interested in that option.  Other terms and conditions may be negotiated with interested parties. The installation desires to start this service in f irst quarter of calander year 03. Interested parties may email me at:  wilsont@eustis.army.mil or call Tom Wilson at (757)878-3804 x2229 for questions. We would like inquiries by 17 Dec 02.
