This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.  
AWARD WILL NOT BE WITHHELD AWAITING QUALIFICATION.  For qualification information/source approval requests contact OC-ALC/BC, 3001 Staff Drive, Ste #1AC85A, Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3009.

<DESC>IAW FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) the 409th CSB - TCC intends to award a single source purchase order to Optimal Technologies International LLC (SDVOSB). The required items are 24 SATA Hard Drives for expansion of existing SUN servers and construction of a COOP (Backup) site at Wiesbaden. The Software sets are required for data replication between production and COOP SANs and to enable data flow between Brocade fiber switched located at the production site and the COOP site. The existing Production Server site at Panzer was installed and configured by contractor in question. The configuration of the COOP site must exactly mirror that of the production site, therefore commissioning an alternate contractor with the configuration is not possible. Also, acquisition of the required software from an alternate source would lead to warranty issues.

<p>Based upon market research, the Government is using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. Interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings related to the procurement described are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. The final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, past performance, and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. In accordance with 10 U. S. C. 2304 (c) (1), other than full and open competition applies.</p>
<p>Conditions for evaluation and acceptance of offers for part numbered items cited in the acquisition identification description (AID): This agency has no data available for evaluating the acceptability of alternate products offered. In addition, to the data required in subparagraph (c) (2) of clause L17C01 (52.217-9002), the offeror must furnish drawings and other data covering the design, materials, etc., of the exact product cited in the AID, sufficient to establish that the offeror's product is equal to the product cited in the AID.</p>

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.

<a href="mailto:kim.adams@nasa.gov">Kimberly J Adams</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has a requirement for Space Launch System(SLS) Core Stage Engines.  The SLS consists of Space Shuttle Program (SSP)-derived andAres components that use existing United States propulsion systems, including liquid fuelengines, cryogenic stages, and solid rocket motor engines.  Specific to the core engine,the system will utilize existing RS-25d (SSME) engines for the core lift capabilities. The RS25-d effort is for the acquisition of storage, adaptation, and reacceptance ofexisting RS-25d Core Stage Engines required for four or five early missions of the SLS(depending upon final manifest needs), which includes moving and storing the residualinventory of fifteen flight engines, two development engines, and associated groundsupport equipment.  The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-267, October 11, 2010) directed the Agencyto develop, as rapidly as possible, replacement vehicles capable of providing both humanand cargo launch capability to destinations beyond low-Earth orbit.  In developing theSLS, the Act directed the Administrator to utilize to the extent practicable existingcontracts, investments, workforce, industrial base, and capabilities from the SSP, Orion,and Ares I projects.  This includes SSP-derived components and Ares components that drawextensively on SSP heritage propulsion systems, including liquid fuel engines, cryogenicstages, and solid rocket motors.  As a result, the Agency will initiate the developmentof the SLS with SSP and Ares derived assets.NASA/MSFC intends to negotiate only with Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) for the SLSCore Stage Engines.  This decision is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, only one responsiblesource and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, whichimplements the authority for 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Competition is impractical for thefollowing reasons: 1)	The Government estimate for the time required for the replacement of the RS-25dCore Stage engines is nine years for development (includes two years to obtain andtransfer the necessary property plus six to seven years for development and fabrication)plus one year for stage and vehicle integration.  Therefore, the schedule for an initialSLS launch would slip from 2017 to no earlier than 2021.  This schedule does meet the2010 Authorization Act intent or the Government schedule for a first launch in 2017.  Thechoice of the RS-25d and its associated performance is also tightly coupled with the tankdiameters and other design characteristics of the SLS Core Stage.  A set of approved andtested engines must be delivered for integration into the Core Stage by the summer of2016 to meet the current SLS manifest.	Thus, no other engine besides the RS-25d canfulfill the SLS architecture requirements while meeting the SLS manifest.  The unique andcritical history, capabilities, and infrastructure make PWR the only contractor with thecapability to implement the use of the existing RS-25d engines as the SLS Core StageEngine.  Any other option besides PWR would involve unacceptable schedule delays, as wellas significantly increased technical risk.2)	PWR designed, developed, and matured the RS-25d engine as the SSME, a processthat began nearly forty years ago, and PWR has been the only responsible source for thedesign, development, repair, refurbishment, testing and flight operations of the RS-25for the life of the SSP.  PWR possesses the sole capability to investigate, resolve, andimplement corrective measures for RS-25d development, production, test, and flightoperations and is the only entity with the historical corporate experience and knowledgeto meet the SLS program needs.	PWRs direct support of the SSP since the 1970s, whichprovided in-depth experience with and exposure to the requirements and processes requiredfor crewed launch vehicles in general and the RS-25d in particular makes it uniquelyqualified to support the December 2017 launch date and other early missions.3)	The experienced PWR staff has demonstrated capabilities for performing complexassemblies of the RS-25d turbomachinery, valves, combustion devices, and the overallengine.  The manifestation of these capabilities is exemplified by PWRs demonstratedexperience of developing new hardware designs for RS-25 components and incorporatingthese new designs into the engine and an active flight program.  It is this criticalknowledge and skill that makes PWR solely capable for performing the work envisioned inSLS for the RS-25d engines.  For another contractor to obtain and relocate these criticalskills, staff capabilities, and historical knowledge base would inherently involve somelevel of capability loss.  This determination is  based upon experience with changing SSPcontractors or contract performance locations and limited capture rates of incumbentpersonnel.  Such a loss would result in cost and schedule impacts and an increase inperformance risks of meeting the December 2017 launch date.4)	 PWRs place of performance continues to be at the contractors facilities inCanoga Park, CA; Desoto, CA; and West Palm Beach, FL.  All engine testing is performed atthe Stennis Space Center (SSC) located near Bay St. Louis, MS.	PWR possesses multiplefacilities capable of turbopump, valve, and engine assembly.  These facilities uniquelyincorporate resources such as cryogenics and furnace operations within 100,000-classclean rooms in which complex assemblies are performed.	The Government has a substantialinvestment in large scale liquid rocket engine production equipment and facilities at themultiple PWR sites, as well as investments in specialized infrastructure and equipment atGovernment owned sites as required to support the development and utilization of theengines.  Duplication of this infrastructure, facilities, special test equipment, groundsupport equipment, transportation and handling equipment, special or unique toolingand/or complex assets under the auspices of a different contractor is cost prohibitive. Transfer of this infrastructure and equipment to another contractor would likely requirepurchasing all that is not currently Government owned; disassembly, transport,reassembly, calibration and, potentially, additional capital investment at anothercontractors site; and training of new personnel to operate the facilities,infrastructure, and equipment.	All of this activity represents cost and schedule impactsrelative to engaging PWR for the RS-25d endeavor.  If the existing inventory of RS-25dengines were not used for this effort, they would be dispositioned and would not beavailable for use by SLS.  This means they would no longer be available for flight ortest for SLS.  If these engines are not utilized, NASA would be duplicating this uniquecapability at a significant taxpayer expense.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>NASA /Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has a requirement for large cryogenicStages (Core Stage and Upper Stage) that are part of the Space Launch System (SLS) thatwill be capable of lifting 70 to 130 metric tons payload to a Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Thiseffort is for the Design, Development, Test, and Evaluation (DDT&E), including the Stagehardware, the activities, and the operations required for early missions of the SLS. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-267, October 11, 2010) directed the Agencyto develop, as rapidly as possible, replacement vehicles capable of providing both humanand cargo launch capability to destinations beyond low-Earth orbit. In developing theSLS, the Act directed the Administrator to utilize to the extent practicable existingcontracts, investments, workforce, industrial base, and capabilities from the SpaceShuttle Program (SSP), Orion, and Ares I projects. This includes SSP-derived componentsand Ares components that draw extensively on SSP heritage propulsion systems, includingliquid fuel engines, cryogenic stages, and solid rocket motors. As a result, the Agencywill initiate the development of the SLS with SSP and Ares derived assets. To meet this objective NASA has selected a launch vehicle architecture that includes alarge cryogenic (LOX/LH2) Core Stage, an Upper Stage when needed for higher performancemissions, high thrust Boosters (initially, using those developed for the Ares I vehicle)for liftoff thrust, using either 3, 4, or 5 RS-25 engines on Core Stage, and using 1, 2,or 3 J-2X engines on Upper Stage. While the launch vehicle configuration will changebased upon mission needs for lift performance, the basic design of the Stages will be thesame for all missions, with the only change being how many engines will be mounted in theMain Propulsion System of the Core Stage (or Upper Stage) for a given mission. The Stageswill share common attributes, such as outer diameter, material, subsystem components, andtooling between the stages to ensure an affordable design and capitalize upon synergiesin those designs. This approach meets budget and schedule constraints targeting a firstflight in December 2017. The payload will be the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV);therefore, the SLS launch vehicle will be designed as human-rated for the first and allsubsequent flights. Since the first launch uses existing assets (including assets alreadyfar along in development) for the remaining major SLS elements, the Core Stage definesthe critical path to first launch as the only element requiring a full development cycle.The Core Stage delivery date is required in late 2016 to support a December 2017 flightdate. The Ares I Upper Stage Production Contract is the only means to meet SLS milestoneschedules and avoid substantial duplication of cost. The Ares I Upper Stage has the samefunctionality as the SLS Core and Upper Stage elements, and much of the Ares I DDT&Eespecially at the component level is applicable to SLS requirements. If the Stages were competed, the critical path to first launch would be delayed 18 months(no earlier than June 2019) due to the competitive acquisition duration along with alonger development cycle from authority to proceed (ATP) to preliminary design review(PDR). The longer duration to PDR results from the need to define and decompose elementrequirements, determine subsystem architectures, decompose and define componentrequirements, bring component vendors on board and/or finalize vendor contracts, anddevelop a preliminary design sufficient to commit to long lead procurements. It is vitalto the overall critical path schedule to keep the duration to PDR as short as possible toallow long lead procurements and tooling fabrication to begin and end at the right times.This cumulative delay in an open competition scenario leads to a launch slip of 18months, resulting in significant increase in cost to first flight. Conversely, by utilizing The Boeing Company (Boeing), ATP can be accelerated, as well asthe time between ATP and PDR shortened, as a result of the similarities and progress sofar on the Ares I Upper Stage. By utilizing the Ares I Upper Stage contract, costduplication would be avoided by using Ares I Upper Stage existing component designs aswell as using the existing vendor suite and capitalizing on work in the subsystems thatwould be needed for the SLS Core Stage. A portion of the manufacturing development for a large cryogenic stage that Boeing hasundertaken on Ares I would be utilized for additional cost duplication avoidance. Much ofthe Ares I Upper Stage hardware and processes (production tooling, welding techniquedevelopment and validation, Thermal Protection System (TPS) application, manufacturing,and product breakdown structure development) are already in place and are applicable tothe larger diameter SLS vehicle. Many cryogenic stage components developed for the Ares IUpper Stage have been matured to the detailed design phase and can be used on SLS eitheras-is or with slight modification. In addition, significant effort has been undertaken toestablish an Ares I Upper Stage supply chain that can be utilized for the SLS MainPropulsion System (MPS), which is on the Core Stage critical path. Given manufacturingdevelopment work completed so far and the fact that Boeing has established a supply chainunder the Ares I Upper Stage contract, especially for the MPS development, there will becost avoidance on SLS by eliminating cost duplication that would be incurred should thiscontract be competed. As a result, the SLS Program Office intends to modify the existing Ares I Upper Stagecontract with Boeing. NASA will establish a new baseline to meet the explorationmissions, consisting of an SLS Core and Upper Stage that will include common designfeatures and be produced with common tooling, procedures, and techniques to obtain Coreand Upper Stage synergies. The anticipated period of performance is from the date of contract modification throughDecember 31, 2021. The statutory authority permitting other than full and opencompetition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsiblesource and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Competing theSLS Core and Upper Stages would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agencysrequirements and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expectedto be recovered through competition. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, whichshall be considered by the Agency. Organizations may submit their capabilities andqualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact notlater than 4:00 p.m. local time on October 13, 2011.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for the purchase of two (2) New TruHeat MF-5030 30kWWSolid State AC Generators.  Description as follows:480VAC, 100 Amps Main, 5-20kHz (Turnable), Free Running Oscillator, Water Cooled, 25 PinAnalog User, 37 Pin 24Volt Digital User, RS-232, RS-485 Digital Interface.  These generators will include Oscillator circuit and 5 Meter Power Cable.  Configuration: 30kW, 5-15 kHz, 600V,Capacitor 4x6uF, 3 x 480VAC, 50/60Hz, 36kVA and 5M Cable, and stand alone version for table top operation.  NASA/GRC intends to purchase these generators from HUTTINGER ELECTRONIC, INC., 4000Burton Dr., Santa Clara, CA 95054.Our present induction heating system is a highly integrated part of a larger system usedfor growing silicon carbide crystals by chemical vapor deposition. The system waspurchased by this vendor many years ago. The RF generator which is just one component ofthe induction heating system suffered a catastrophic failure.  Due to its age some of therequired replacement parts are no longer stocked or manufactured. Exact replacement isnot possible as this particular model of generator is no longer manufactured. Thereplacement induction heating system will require two RF generators along with remotetank circuits and all cables and control interfaces. Integration of the new induction heating system with the control and safety systems willmost easily be completed by using the same manufacturer of the original induction heatingsystem as all the control and safety systems have stayed the same. Our research has shown that selection of another make of induction heating system wouldrequire NASA to be completely responsible for integration of the replacement inductionheating system with the rest of the chemical vapor deposition system. This would includedeveloping an integration strategy with all of the existing safety systems and thenimplementing that strategy. NASA would also need to develop and implement a means tointegrate the controls systems with the existing controls systems. This would make thecurrent control software unusable and NASA would be forced to devote considerableresources to design, develop, and implement it own software programs for operation of thechemical vapor deposition system. With this level modification the original manufacturer(Aixtron Inc.) of the chemical vapor deposition system would no longer provide supportfor this equipment. Overall, this would not be cost effective to the Government.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the SimplifiedAcquisiiton Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13.  The Sole Source is under the authority of FAR reference 13.106-1(b)1. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon September 29, 2011  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southwest (NAVFACSW) intends to award a contract to one source (Southern California Gas Co.) under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2913, which allows the Navy to enter into agreements with gas or electric utility companies to design and implement cost-effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facilities alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy savings devices and technologies by the utility companies) to address the requirement and circumstances of the installation.  

NOTE:  The solicitation will not be made available on this website.

This notice is provided for information purposes only therefore FAR 5.203 does not apply.
  This opportunity is available only to the utility contractor servicing San Nicolas Island under a Utilities Energy Service Contract (UESC) N62473-09-G-5012, Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), for the installation, replacement, renovation, repair, operation and maintenance of energy conservation measures and consuming equipment.  Services shall include, but not be limited to, upgrades to Facilities Management Systems (FMS), installation of energy management systems and direct digital controls, implementation of energy conservation measures, and limited Operation and Maintenance (O&M) services for any energy savings devices and technologies installed under any Delivery Order awarded under this BOA at various navy facilities within the service territory of Southern California Gas Co.

Project Description:

The proposed procurement is to install two wind turbines, Project Numbers P0884 and P0885 (Options), for the WIND TURBINE GENERATION PROJECT ON SAN NICOLAS ISLAND.
  This project is funded to install WTG#4 and WTG#5, Options to Phases I & II that were not exercised, as part of a multiphased dding two 100-kW Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) on San Nicolas Island.  The WTGs will offset the costs of the JP-5 fuel that is transported by barge to San Nicolas Island to fuel the existing diesel power plant.  This project is the still part of Phase I & II of a multiphased construction project to install a total of nine 100-kW WTGs and an energy storage system on San Nicolas Island.   Specific incentives being offered by Southern California Gas Co. for implementation of this project are engineering services to perform a feasibility study and engineering design for the installation of supplemental heating devices on select facilities on SNI that could take advantage of excess energy produced from the WTG's during low system demand periods.
  This effort will build upon the Southern California Gas Co.'s Facility Load Shedding Program Audit performed during the Phase I design.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development in India (USAID/India) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for their new sustainable landscapes/forestry program titled Partnership for Land Use Science (FOREST-PLUS).  The solicitation may be released towards the latter half of October 2011.During a five year performance period, the contract will help accelerate Indias transition to a low emissions economy by taking REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) actions to scale.  This will be achieved by working on two components- design of tools and methodologies and their deployment at scale. Working in close collaboration with the Government of Indias Ministry of Environment and Forests, local governments and the local communities, the Forest-PLUS contract will create an enabling environment and strengthen capacity for REDD+ implementation in India.  The contract will assist in - developing  and deploying scientific tools and  methods  for  improved ecosystem management and carbon sequestration, forest carbon inventory and reference baselines; designing modalities/ programs for providing better  incentives to forest-dependent communities for promoting REDD+ activities ; addressing sectorial barriers; and enhancing human and institutional capacity. The award of the contract shall be made subject to the availability of funds. This notice does not obligate USAID to award a contract nor does it commit the U.S. Government to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of proposals.Any questions regarding this notice should be directed in writing to Arun Sehgal, Acquisition Specialist, USAID/INDIA at indiarco@usaid.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The BQM-167A utilizes multiple pieces of drone-unique, peculiar support equipment and test equipment, and any candidate subscale target must be compatible with this existing equipment. The candidate subscale target shall be interoperable with the existing Air Force drone facility and range systems at Tyndall AFB, FL. The candidate subscale target shall not require major modifications to existing drone facilities, range, and support equipment nor require additional manpower unless the Air Force can realize a net cost benefit. Potential offerors shall have the capability to provide depot-level supply, repair and maintenance support as well as Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) manuals (in accordance with (IAW) TMCR 86-01) and O&amp;M training for the target system.

<p><br />The Government anticipates contract award not later than (NLT) Mar 2014. The offeror must deliver subscale targets at a rate of approximately four (4) targets per month beginning in May 2015 in order to maintain an adequate inventory of subscale targets to support Air Force operational requirements. After contract award, the Government may require the contractor to conduct a minimum of two successful qualification flight tests prior to executing a decision to procure the first lot. A First Article Acceptance Testing (FAAT) may be conducted on the initial production articles prior to Government acceptance of the first lot of targets. In addition, the base contract and options for each lot may include the following provisions: (1) Procurement of a variable quantity ranging from twenty four (24) to seventy two (72) targets, with a best-estimated- quantity (BEQ) of forty (40) targets per lot; (2) Depot-level logistic support; (3) Extended Warranty; (4) On-site technical representative at Tyndall AFB, FL and/or other designated AF range; (5) Spares provisioning; and (6) Sustaining Engineering. A total of five (5) production lots are currently projected for this contract. Lastly, the Air Force does not have any development funds for this acquisition, only production funds. Therefore, potential offerors must be able to comply with performance and schedule requirements without requiring any developmental effort.<br /><br />Potential offerors who have a candidate subscale target that can meet the performance and schedule requirements outlined above are invited to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC). The SOC shall include tailored, independent test reports that document the assertion that the candidate system has demonstrated it is capable of meeting all performance requirements identified above. In addition, the offeror shall provide a manufacturing plan that demonstrates its capability to meet the required delivery schedule and production rate. Firms responding to this synopsis should also state whether or not they are a small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBzone certified, woman-owned, service-disabled veteran owned, veteran owned, or minority-owned concern as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-1. The Government will base its decision as to whether this acquisition shall be full and open competition, small business set-aside, or sole source on responses to this synopsis and other market research. Offerors shall limit the SOC to 25 pages, including attachments.<br /><br />The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition shall be 336411 with a size standard of 1500 employees. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an invitation for bid (IFB) or request for proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. As directed by the Foreign Disclosure Office, Eglin AFB, FL, no foreign participation shall be allowed for this acquisition. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to appropriate Government personnel. When required, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. <br /><br />The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the contracting POC identified below. The Ombudsman is Brigadier General David A. Harris, AAC/CV, located at 101 West D Ave., Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542. He may be contacted via email at david.harris@eglin.af.mil or phone number (850) 882-5422.

(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law.

<DESC>Contract No. R11PX30403
Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition - Sole Source
Introduction:  As required by FAR 13.501(a)(i) and  RAR WBR 1413.501 this Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOTFOC) is prepared to document the facts and rationale justifying the authority cited in Paragraph 4 to negotiate with a sole offeror for the above requirement.  This JOTFOC follows the format and contains all the information required under FAR 6.303-2.
1.  Identification of Agency, Contracting Activity and Document.   
Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Regional Office, Justification for other than Full and Open Competition for the purchase of Hitachi Breaker Spare Parts. 
2.  Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved.  
The purchase of Hitachi spare parts from Hitachi's only authorized distributor HVB AE Power System Inc. (HVB.)
3.  Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet Agency's Need
The purchase of breaker spare parts from HVB AE POWER SYSTEM INC (HVB) for the following breakers:
	(1)  SF6 Main Unit Breaker N724	(2)  SF6 Main Unit Breaker A424.
4.  Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.  
The statutory authority for use of other than full and open competition for this transaction is FAR Subpart 13.5 Test Programs for Commercial Items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  5.  Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications/Nature of Acquisition Requiring Use of Cited Authority.
 Hitachi is the original manufacturer of these breakers. No other vendor has the ability to manufacture these parts because the technology to manufacture these parts is proprietary to Hitachi. HVB is the only authorized distributor for Hitachi Breaker spare parts installed on all Hoover Dam's nineteen Generators. In addition, these breakers were custom designed for Hoover Dam and therefore, no other vendor can manufacture an equal product.  Additionally, other vendors do not have access to the Hitachi proprietary drawings and technical data to allow them to reverse engineer the spare parts with a high degree of confidence that these spares will function consistently, reliably and at the same operational effectiveness as the original Hitachi parts. 
6.Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as Possible. 
Pursuant to FAR 5.101(a), a synopsis notice of the contract action was posted on the FedBizOps website.
The notice of intent to sole source was posted on 08/16/2011 and no responses were received. 
Hitachi is the original manufacturer of these breakers. HVB is the only authorized distributor for Hitachi Breaker spare parts\and installed on all nineteen Generators. Market research shows that companies such as GE were contacted to see if they can manufacture these breaker parts. GE confirmed that they used to manufacture these specific breaker parts, however, sold their breaker manufacturing company to HVB.  Additionally, there are other companies such as Westinghouse, Siemens, ABB, Elimsan and Elcon International that can manufacture breakers, however, research show that these parts cannot be modified to ensure compatibility with Hoover Dam's existing breakers. 
7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price. 
The estimated price for the purchase of spare parts for the SF6 breakers is $160,000. The price will be determined to be fair and reasonable based on comparison to similar items and information provided by the vendor, HVB. 
8.  Market Survey. See section 6. 
9.  Additional Supporting Facts for Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition.None. 
10.  Listing of Sources Expressing Interest in Acquisition.   
No sources expressed an interest in the acquisition as a result of the special notice of intent to sole source published in Federal Business Opportunities website (www.FBO.gov.)   
11.  Action Taken to Remove and Overcome Barriers to Competition.  
All breakers would need to be fully replaced at the same time with a commercially available product where spare parts are interchangeable amongst the products. It is highly unlikely that this would occur because these products are typically developed for each agency's need. Because the nature of power generating facilities, these products are usually custom designed in some manner to fit needs of that specific power plant. 
12.  Approvals.  The supporting data, which is the responsibility of the Bureau of Reclamation technical personnel and forms basis for this justification, have been certified as complete and accurate by means of the below signature on this document.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Affymetrix, Inc., 3420 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051.  National Institutes on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Division of Intramural Research in Baltimore, Maryland maintenance on the following instruments: GCS serial 74900234 640 serial 12386 auto serial A13720 FS450 serial 60123080 FS450U serial FS0290 GC30007G serial 50209150 WS-SYS serial F4RLFG1   Currently in the lab is a Affymetrix GeneChip Analysis system used to look at chromosomal regions for potential involvement with drug abuse. A maintenance contract is required for this instrument.  In accordance with FAR6.302-1, the supplies required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, Affymetrix, Inc. and no other supplier will satisfy the agency requirements.  There are no licensed systems or instruments offered by third party providers that are able to use any components of the Affymetrix, Gene Chip System, including arrays.  The highest SNP density commercially available is needed to identify drug abuse vulnerability loci and prove or disprove the idea of polygenic contributions of common allelic variants to drug abuse vulnerability.
The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. FURTHER, IT DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent Federal agency with the primary missions of investigating civil aviation accidents in the United States and significant accidents in the other modes of transportation -- railroad, highway, marine and pipeline -- and issuing safety recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The NTSB has a requirement for electric utility service at the NTSB Conference Center located at 470 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Washington D.C. 20594. The NTSB intends to issue a non-competitive contract to&nbsp;Potomac Electric Power Company&nbsp;(PEPCO) located at 701 9th ST NW, STE 3, Washington, DC 20001-4572. The period of performance of this requirement is from October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PEPCO is currently providing this service via existing PEPCO power lines. The technical risk would be significant if the NTSB were to change contractors for this requirement. If the NTSB were to change contractors, there could be loss of&nbsp;power&nbsp;to both the NTSB and many of its clients during transition as new power lines are installed and configured. In additon, PEPCO&nbsp;uses meters to measure usage&nbsp;installed and maintained by PEPCO onsite. The cost to change contractors and to install new meters would not be cost effective or in the best interests of the Government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This requirement is conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 - Acquisition of Commerical Items. The authority for this award is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), Soliciting from a single source. For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonable available.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements are invited to submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information, which must be prepared specifically in response to this notice should, must include: (1) identification of company or organization; (2) an assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements; (3) business/contracts/marketing office point(s) of contact; (4) notification of business size and /or special status; and (5) any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited. These expressions of interest shall adhere to a no greater than 5-page submission limit plus web links and any specialized product descriptions. The statement of qualifications should include only information that clearly demonstrates the respondent's capabilities, expertise, and experience to perform the requirements described in this notice. General marketing material should not be included. The NTSB prefers that companies do not submit proprietary material.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/. FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage can serve as an alternative if the FBO website is unavailable. 

The Naval Surface Warfare Center has a requirement for software updates and battery replacements for 149 MK67 Mod 0 Demolition Firing Devices in support of Blue Water Explosive Ordnance Disposal. These updates and replacements were not considered at time of award of N00164-08-D-4279.
 A requirement for software updates and battery replacements of the MK67 Mod 0 Firing Device were identified during the Weapons Systems Explosive Safety Review Board and Systems Safety Technical Review Panel evaluations performed by the Government after contract award. Rothenbuhler Engineering owns the proprietary rights for the MK67 Mod 0 software which makes them the only source capable of satisfying the Governments requirement. 

The additional CLIN will be added to contract N00164-08-D-4279 under P000012 and a Delivery Order will be placed with Rothenbuhler Engineering on or about 30 September 2011. If any questions concerning this Government procurement please contact Sherry Wikle, Contracting Officer, at the following points of contact: Phone: 812-854-3691; Email Address: sheryl.wikle@navy.mil; mailing address: NAVAL SURFACE WARFARE CENTER, CRANE DIVISION; BUILDING 64, CODE CXC; 300 HIGHWAY 361; CRANE, IN 47522-5001.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.wawftraining.eb.mil</span>. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor Central Registration database </span>and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.wawftraining.eb.mil </span>is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. </span></p>

<SUBJECT>Annual KenCast FAZZT Software Licenses & Maintenance Support
<SOLNBR>FA8224-11-R-0044
<RESPDATE>101211
<CONTACT>Hope E Gonzales, Phone 801-777-5081, Fax 801-777-4569, Email hope.gonzales@hill.af.mil
<DESC>This is a commercial acquisition. The synopsis and solicitation are being Combined. Other Than Full and Open Competition. The Air Force intends to renew one (1) year of KenCast FAZZT software licenses and maintenance support.
<p>The Justification and Approval supporting Other Than Full and Open Competition:</p>
<p>This renewal allows the government to receive software licenses as well as technical support. KenCast, Inc. is the only provider for the maintenance agreement of their systems and unique applicability to the Global Broadcasting System (GBS) software licenses. There is very little we can do to avoid a sole source situation. There is no alternative for this purchase due to the satellite system software which is in place. It would not be technically advantageous nor is it in the best interest of the Government. No other manufacturer has been found which is compatible to the existing satellite system software.</p>
<p>KenCast Inc is the only known source that can satisfy the Government's requirement. The maintenance agreements to support the existing KenCast licenses must be provide by KenCast Inc as their software is proprietary. This software has capabilities that are unique to the GBS. KenCast Inc. was contacted to request a list of distributors or secondary vendors of their software licenses. KenCast Inc. is the sole proprietary supplier of the software licenses and there are no other vendors. A search of various search engines including Google and Bing were used and no other compatible software developers were identified.</p>
<p>The entire solicitation will be made available only on FedBizOpps (FBO) website at: https://www.fbo.gov. All current/future information about this acquisition, i.e. solicitation, amendments, purchase specification, and Q &amp;A's will be distributed through FBO. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this solicitation.</p>
<p>Please use the solicitation document attached to this posting for proposal submissions. Any questions concerning this requirement must be submitted in writing via email at least THREE WORKING DAYS prior to the closing date. Questions need to be emailed directly to Hope Gonzales at Hope.Gonzales@hill.af.mil.</p>
<p>AUTHORITY: 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C)(1), JUSTIFICATION: SUPPLIES REQUIRED ARE FROM ONLY ONE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF RESPONSIBLE SOURCE(S) AND NO OTHER TYPE OF SUPPLIES WILL SATISFY AGENCY REQUIREMENTS.</p>
<p>THE PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES AND SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE, OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SOURCES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.301-1. INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. HOWEVER, ALL PROPOSALS RECEIVED PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE ON THE SOLICITATION WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT. A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED CONTRACT BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT. SPECIFICATIONS, PLANS, OR DRAWING RELATING TO THE PROCUREMENT DESCRIBED ARE INCOMPLETE OR NOT AVAILABLE AND CANNOT BE FURNISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT OWN THE DATA OR RIGHTS TO THE DATA NEEDED TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM FROM ADDITIONAL SOURCES.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

The Government will review proposals to determine whether or not that offeror has adequately demonstrated an ability to meet or exceed the Government's requirements ON Section 3.1 of the PWS. For each requirement technical requirement task, offers demonstrating an ability to perform will at a minimum be determined "acceptable" for that requirement task. Proposals that merely restate the contents of the PWS or do not demonstrate an adequate ability to perform will be deemed unacceptable. Depending on each contractor's capability, they may be considered outside the realm of acceptability and not provided an opportunity to revise their quote if discussions become necessary.</p>
<p>ii. PAST PERFORMANCE (Page limit - 5 pages)</p>
<p>Offerors shall submit a narrative describing their experience in providing services over the past three years.

<p>iii. RESPONSIBILITY (Page limit - 5 pages)</p>
<p>To be determined responsible, a prospective contractor must:<br />(i) Have adequate financial resources to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them (see 9.104-3)<br />(a));<br />(ii) Be able to comply with the required or proposed delivery or performance schedule, taking into<br />consideration all existing commercial and governmental business commitments;<br />(iii) Have a satisfactory performance record (see FAR 9.104-3(b) and Subpart 42.15).

<p>Price Evaluation is to be performed by the Contract Specialist and Contracting Officer. Vendors are required to submit price quotes in accordance with the proposed CLIN structure. Vendors are to provide firm-fixed pricing for each of the CLIN's as well as a total price for the entire effort. Vendors may quote travel expenses on a cost basis. Travel is going to be considered in the price evaluation.<br />Each offeror's proposed price will be evaluated for reasonableness. The Government currently intends to award a contract for the 1 year base and two years options, therefore the total price of a vendor's proposal will consider the price for all CLINs and the total estimated price for each year and, potentially, the cost of travel.<br />It is the Government's intention to award without negotiating, under lowest price, technically acceptable (LPTA) evaluation approach.<br />FAR 52.212-3, "Offeror Representations and Certification--Commercial Items."

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6 "SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS", AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.This solicitation number is RFQ-RT-11-00159 and is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ) using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This effort will support the US EPA National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL). The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code: 541380- Testing Laboratories, which has a Small Business Size Standard of $12 million. The United State Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a contract for the Gulf Ecology Division within NHEERL. General Description: The Gulf Ecology Division (USEPA/NHEERL/GED) is conducting a study in collaboration to determine the rates, composition, and sources of organic carbon buried in three bayous situated in watersheds with different land use histories. A goal of this project is to determine whether land development and land use can affect the rates and quantities of organic carbon buried in coastal bayous. As su ch we require laboratory analyses of total organic carbon (TOC) concentration, total nitrogen (TN) concentration, stable nitrogen (&#61540;15N) and carbon (&#61540;13C) isotopic composition (Task 1), and the stable carbon isotopic signature of fatty acid methylated ester (FAME) samples (Task 2) as indicated below. The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, facilities and equipment, and otherwise do all things necessary for, or incidental to complete the following tasks. Task 1: Quantification of sediment TOC and TN concentrations and stable nitrogen (&#61540;15N) and carbon (&#61540;13C) isotopic composition. Task 2: Quantification of FAME compound specific stable isotope (carbon &#61540;13C) signature. Task to Be Accomplished: 1. For Task 1, contractor shall provide the US EPA with a cost estimate (per sample) for determination of the following analysis: A minimum of 200 and a maximum of 400 sediment samples for determination of TOC and TN concentrations and stab le isotopic (&#61540;15N and &#61540;13C) composition. 2. For Task 2, contractor shall provide the US EPA with a cost estimate (per sample) for determination of the following analysis: A minimum of 200 and a maximum of 400 FAME samples for compound specific stable isotope analyses (CSIA). (see attached pricing sheet) 3.  Contractor shall receive:
Sample	Container	Volume of sample	Storage until processingSediment	Glass vial	&#8804;20mL	Frozen (&#8804; -20?C)FAME	Glass vial	10&#61549;L ? 2mL	Frozen under N2 (&#8804; -20?C)General Requirements:  1. Methods ? Proposed laboratory methods and QA/QC for the analyses of sediment and FAME samples for each parameter of interest are described below. Offerors may respond with methods that differ from those proposed; however, any alternative methods must be based on practices currently accepted by sediment science and the methods must meet or exceed the QA/QC requirements stated by this scope of work. Offerors shall include their Standard Operation Procedures (SOP?s) for each analytical process as part of their response. Sample analyses shall include the following QA/QC elements: Method detection limit. For TOC and TN analyses: >3-point standard curve, using acetanilide as the standard, with an r2 of &#8805; 0.99. Curve points should extend below and above the lowest and highest sample values, respectively. Inclusion of the following for every 20 samples analyzed: One laboratory blank run as an unknown. One standard run as an unknown.  One duplicate samp le. If standard deviation between replicate samples is greater than 5, additional replicates shall be added and noted in QA report. For &#61540;15N and &#61540;13C analyses, analytical precision (2&#963;) for standards should be less than ? 15 ? for &#948;13C and &#948;15N and error between duplicate samples should not exceed ? 0.20 ?. For CSIA of FAME samples: Instrumental precision should be 0.3? or better. Run a mixture of standard compounds. Run a sample of methanol used to derivatize the FAMEs. The mean variance of all analytes of interest in standard reference materials shall be documented in the QAPP and reported for each batch of samples. The contractor shall re analyze (at no cost to the Government) samples if results of the blanks or standards are deemed unacceptable for the methods utilized.  The contractor shall permit QA audit of laboratory and/or data entry procedures by an authorized agent of EPA at any time while conducting the analyses (given advance notific ation). Sediment TOC + TN Concentrations and Stable Isotopic Signature (&#61540;13C + &#61540;15N): USEPA/NHEERL/GED shall provide contractor with sediment samples collected January ? March 2011.  Frozen samples shall be express mailed to the contractor for analysis according to Cloern et al. (2002). Briefly, plant fragments and other detritus shall be removed by sieving (2mm). Sediments shall be dried to a constant weight at &#8804;60?C and then ground into a powder until homogenous. A dry, powdered subsample shall be weighed into a silver capsule. Inorganic carbon shall be removed from the samples with a 10% HCl solution until CO2 release is no longer visible (Hedges and Stern 1984); sample shall be dried again to constant weight and held in a desiccator until analysis for C and N concentration and isotopic signature. Sample weight shall depend on total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) content. CSIA of FAME extracts: USEPA/NHEERL/GED shall express mail purified  and derivitized FAME samples to the vendor. The FAME extracts shall be from sediment samples extracted according to a modified Bligh and Dyer (1959) method (Canuel and Martens 1993; Canuel et al. 1997). The CSIA of the FAME extract shall be determined in a method consistent with Canuel et al. (1997) and Abrajano et al. (1994). 2.  Data Reporting Requirements ? A written report detailing the methods used and all final data reports shall be submitted in both hardcopy and electronic formats; electronic data shall be in ASCII comma-delimited or Excel format.  Analytical results for each sample shall be linked to the Sample ID code designated by the US EPA; in addition, all requested QA/QC data shall be included in each final report-for both hardcopy and electronic formats. Any laboratory notes discussing problems encountered shall be included as an appendix to this report. Original records, such as laboratory notebooks and chromatograms, shall be retained for three years follow ing final report submission; copies may be requested to be sent to the EPA up to the three year period. Results for TOC and TN analyses shall be reported in mg TOC gram-1 dry sediment.  Results for isotopic analyses shall be expressed using (1) the ratio of heavy to light isotopes (i.e., 13C:12C and 15N:14N) and (2) the &#61540; notation in parts per thousand (?). The &#61540; of 13C and 15N represents deviations of each sample from the standard and shall be calculated as: &#61540;X = [Rsample / Rstandard -1] x 103 where X is 13C or 15N and R is 13C/12C or 15N/14N. Peedee Belemnite (PDB) shall be used as the standard for C samples while atmospheric N2 shall be used as the standard for N samples. 3.  Audits and Performance Reviews - With advance notice, the US EPA reserves the right to request that any data files or records relevant to the performance of this scope of work be made available for review. A routine audit of data quality may be scheduled after conclusion of the w ork; if so, the contractor shall be provided with a list of elements to be reviewed as well as a reasonable time frame to prepare for the audit.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will be issued and is attached to this notice. The solicitation number is SAQMMA11R0410 and is issued as a request for proposals (RFP), unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-53. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334111 with a small business size standard of 1000 employees or less. This requirement is set aside for all Service Disabled Veteran Owned Firms Only.<br /><br />The U.S. Department of State utilizes various types of computers and workstations to meet their needs. This particular requirement comes from the Bureau of Diplomatic Security Office of Computer Investigations and Forensics Laboratory (DS/ICI/CIF) for the examination and analysis of digital data seized or captured during the course of investigations being conducted by or in cooperation with the Diplomatic Security Service. <br /><br />The specialized software used to conduct forensic examinations requires systems which meet exacting specifications in order to perform at maximum efficiency. These programs place high demands on both the system processors and RAM. The utilization of large quantities of certified high speed RAM and dual multi-core processors allow rapid execution of requests to the system. As a result these systems generated much more heat than a standard desktop computer and must be outfitted with multiple fans which cool the processors, chipsets, hard disk drives and RAM. Properly configured cases, with customized wire management, aid in maximizing airflow within the case and assist in keeping internal temperatures at reduced levels. Multiple low noise fans are also necessary for the cooling of the systems and minimization of noise in the lab which has 6 to 10 systems operating at each workstation.<br />The systems must also provide easy tool less access to the internal system components to provide for quick and easy access for the addition or replacement of internal components.&nbsp; Transitioning from one data set (case) to the next requires that data drives in the system be replaced with sanitized drives to ensure that no data from previous cases is mingled with the new case evidence. The use of tray less hot swappable drive bays, accessible from outside the system, facilitates this exchange of drives without tools and without having to enter the system case, unplug power and data cables and remove and replace multiple screws. Cases comprised of large data sets require supplemental external storage devices which must be connected to the forensic workstation via high speed data ports. These high speed data ports should be, when possible, accessible from the front or rear of the system.<br /><br />In accordance with these requirements twenty (20) workstations built to the following technical specifications for the capabilities described herein are required for delivery (Government preference is 30 Days after award), however delivery time schedule will be a evaluation factor therefore all firms are requested to offer a date they can make delivery by, in additional all parts and labor must be warranty for up to 3 years minimum:<br /><br />Full 10 bay tower configured with built-in user touch sensor and maximum air-flow with two (2) top exhaust green (optional) led fans -120x120x25mm, 2000rpm 17dBA led fans, one (1) rear exhaust fan -120mm,1200rpm, 17dBA and one (1) side intake fan -200x230x30mm, 900 rpm, 150 cfm with the following front I/O ports -4 x usb 3.0, 4 x usb 2.0, 1 x eSATA, 1 x 1394a, 1 x Mic, 1 Intel HD / AC 97 audio ports with customized wire management, maximizing air flow and durability.<br />Dual Intel Xeon X5680 Westmere 3.33GHz 12MB L3 Cache LGA 1366 130W Six-Core Server Processors with Intel CPU Active heat sinks with fixed fans<br />SuperMicro Server Motherboard with Dual Intel 5520(Tylersburg) chipsets, customized and cooled with two (2) 40mm 3500rpm fans for best system performance and stability, Intel 82576 Dual-Port Gigabit Ethernet controller, 6x SATA2 ports via ICH10R controller, 7x PCI-E 2.0 (x8) slots<br />48GB DDR3 1333 Registered ECC Intel Certified Kingston Server Memory with lifetime manufacturer warranty<br />Western Digital 600GB VelociRaptor SATA 10000 RPM 32MB Cache 2.5 inch 6GB/S -5yr.

<p>Paragraph (a) This is a competitive best value source selection in which the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The Government intends to make award to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror. The Government intends to award without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. The following listed are evaluation factors that shall be used in the evaluation process:</p>
<p>1. Technical Capability: Technical Acceptability is achieved when the offeror provides proof that the products meet the minimum standards and are in compliance with the grade of the products specified, based on product literature/description (i.e., products brochures and/or products catalog data).<br />2. Price<br />All offerors shall submit technical description of the products being offered in sufficient detail in addition to the price proposal, to evaluate compliance with the requirements in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(i) Initially, Technical Acceptability for all offerors will be rated as "met" or "failed" by personnel designated in 374 Maintenance Squadron. Technical Acceptability is met when the offeror submits proof of the technical capability with the requirements. <br />(ii) Next, technically acceptable offers shall be ranked according to evaluated prices. The price evaluation will document for the offers evaluated the completeness, and reasonableness of the proposed price. Incomplete or unreasonable offers shall be rejected and elmiminated from further consideration. A single award will result from this evaluation. If the lowest offeror meets the Government technical capability as defined in above paragraph (a)2, a Purchase Order will be awarded to the lowest offeror with technically acceptable capability. If the lowest offeror fails to meet the Government technical acceptable capability, the Government will then go to the next low offeror in the same manner if they meet the technical capability. This process will continue until an offeror is found to meet the Government technical acceptable capability in ascending order of the low price. <br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation
For
Hysteroscopy Set


1.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items and services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation (VA-258-11-RQ-1025) is being issued as a Request for Quotation.  This notice and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  All responsible sources may submit a proposal.

2.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 339113 - Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing.  Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov, in order to be considered for award.

3.  The Government contemplates an award of a Firm Fixed Priced purchase order contract resulting from this solicitation.

4.  Description of services:  Hysteroscopy is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in gynecology and has diverse applications with multiple potential benefits.  This hysteroscopy set is complete and has multiple applications allowing for multiple procedures to be performed including diagnostic hysteroscopy, directed biopsies, endometrial ablation, hysteroscopic sterilization, uterine septum resection, and resectoscopic curettage, polypectomy, and myomectomy.  For operative procedures, the energy source is a bipolar electro-surgical unit generator which is already owned by the Phoenix VA.  Currently, approximately 69% of the gynecologic surgical case volume requires some type of hysteroscopy.  Sterilization SOP is such that only one case can be performed per day.  Furthermore, if there is some irregularity with the equipment on the given day of a scheduled procedure, the case must be cancelled due to no duplication of equipment.  This purchase will duplicate a pre-existing hysteroscopy set and will allow the Phoenix VA Health Care System to perform more than one case per day and provide a backup system as noted above.  Irrigation tubing, canisters, and single use disposable electrodes have already been purchased.   This solicitation will use brand name or equal product descriptions.

This combined synopsis & solicitation notice is a request for competitive quotations.  Therefore, all capability statements or quotations received prior to the RFQ close date will be considered by the VA.  

5.  The Government will award a single purchase order contract resulting from this RFQ to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value in terms of technical capability and price.



7.  Submit the following documents in response to this RFQ:

     a. Product Specification Document  

     b. Price Quotation
    
8.	Offers are due on September 29, 2011 3:00 PM EST.  All questions/inquiries must be submitted to the contract officer via electronic mail (e-mail).  Submit offers or any questions to the attention of Jeffery A. Thomas via email to:  Jeffery.Thomas2@va.gov.  Offerors who fail to complete and submit the requirements above may be considered non-responsive.

IAW FAR 15.101-1, the Government will determine best value using the tradeoff process. The tradeoff process will lead to an award decision that is made on the basis of trade-offs between the following price and non-cost evaluation factors:<br /><br />Factor 1. Technical and Management Approach<br />Factor 2. Relevant Past Performance<br />Factor 3. Small Business Subcontracting Plan<br />Factor 4. Price</p>
<p>Selection and award of the IDIQ award will be based on the following aforementioned evaluation criteria in descending order of importance: Technical and Management Approach, Relevant Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Plan and Price. Technical and Management Approach is considered to be more important than Past Performance and Small Business Subcontracting Plan; however, when combined they are significantly more important than price. As the Technical and Management Approach, Relevant Past Performance and Small Business Subcontracting Plan scores converge, the price may become more important.</p>
<p>FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT APPROACH: The Government will evaluate each Offeror's Technical and Management Approach to determine their capacity to perform all the requirements outlined in the PWS, which will include, but will not be limited to, an evaluation of the following: the Offeror's proposed mix of labor categories and level of effort proposed for the solicited services; the Offeror's approach to managing its personnel (Contractor's ability to attract, retain, supervise and motivate top quality personnel with the critical skills and abilities IAW the PWS); the Offeror's approach to provide the required courses; the offeror's approach to providing necessary facilities; and the Offeror's approach to curriculum development based on an evaluation of the submitted course curriculum. Additionally, the Government will evaluate the proposed instructor's qualifications as to whether they meet or exceed the experience requirements outlined in PWS 1.3.2.1.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2: RELEVANT PAST PERFORMANCE: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information on the submitted "Past Performance Evaluation Document". The Government reserves the right to utilize past performance information other than the information submitted with the offers received in conducting the evaluation. An Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, but will receive a neutral rating. The Government may consider past performance information regarding predecessor companies or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is considered relevant.</p>
<p>FACTOR 3: SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTING PLAN: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's, except for small business offerors, small business subcontracting plan. As small businesses are not required to submit a small business subcontracting plan, small business offerors will receive the highest rating for this factor. Large businesses that submit a signed statement that states that they will not subcontract any work of the resultant contract will receive a neutral rating.&nbsp; Large businesses' submitted subcontracting plans will be evaluated as to the degree to which the subcontracting plan meets Fiscal Year 2011 USCG Small Business Subcontracting Goals, which are stated as follows (small business subcontracts: 40%, small disadvantaged business subcontracts: 5%, woman owned small business subcontracts: 5%, HUBZone subcontracts: 3%, and service disabled veteran owned small business subcontracts: 3%.&nbsp; Additionally large businesses' history of compliance with Subcontracting Reporting Requirements in other federal contracts and how well the large businesses have met planned Small Business Subcontracting goals&nbsp;in previous awards will be evaluated.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>EVALUATION FACTORS AND BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>Basis for Award</p>
<p>The basis of award of this RFQ is lowest price, technically acceptable (LPTA). Quotes will be rated on three non-price evaluation factors using the adjectival rating scale herein and on price.</p>
<p>VOLUME 1 - EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>NOTE: Volume 1 shall not contain any reference to pricing.<br />The technical proposal section is comprised of factors relating to the offeror's ability to perform. Offerors are highly encouraged to review the Performance Work Statement, prior to preparing a technical proposal. <br />Offerors shall prepare and compile the information listed under each factor below and clearly label the response to each factor.<br />a. FACTORS<br />i. Technical Capability<br />ii. Past Performance<br />iii. Price</p>
<p>i. TECHNICAL CAPABILITY (Page limit - 5 pages)</p>
<p>The quality of each contractor's quote is an example of their ability to perform and may be considered in the evaluation of their proposal. <br />Technical Capability is the primary determining factor of an offeror's ability to perform. Offerors shall describe how they meet or plan to meet all mandatory requirements in the respective Performance Work Statement (PWS) and contract clauses. The Government will review proposals to determine whether or not that offeror has adequately demonstrated an ability to meet or exceed the Government's requirements ON Section 3.1 of the PWS. For each requirement technical requirement task, offers demonstrating an ability to perform will at a minimum be determined "acceptable" for that requirement task. Proposals that merely restate the contents of the PWS or do not demonstrate an adequate ability to perform will be deemed unacceptable. Depending on each contractor's capability, they may be considered outside the realm of acceptability and not provided an opportunity to revise their quote if discussions become necessary.</p>
<p>ii. PAST PERFORMANCE (Page limit - 5 pages)</p>
<p>Offerors shall submit a narrative describing their experience in providing services over the past three years. Describe two projects, similar in size and complexity to the effort contemplated herein (at least $100,000) and in sufficient detail for the Government to perform an evaluation. Examples of offered services must be relevant and have been found to be acceptable by the client. At a minimum, the offeror shall provide the following information: <br />Project/Contract Name<br />Project Description<br />Dollar Amount of Project<br />Project Duration, including the original estimated completion date and the actual completion date<br />Type of Customer: Federal Government, State/Local Government, or private industry<br />Point of Contact<br />Telephone Number<br />Email Address<br />Projects must include a brief, but detailed description of the work performed and results achieved; proposed and actual milestones, tasks or deliverables and explanations for any delays; methodologies, tools and/or processes used in work performance; and problems encountered and corrective actions taken.<br />The Offeror shall demonstrate it has expertise required to meet all requirements of this RFQ based on past performance history in managing significant projects and contracts that are similar in nature. <br />In order for the offeror to achieve a rating above "acceptable." the work described in the projects must demonstrate the successful completion of tasks, which were of a similar or greater complexity to the types of tasks described in the statement of work and proposed to be accomplished by the offeror.</p>
<p>iii. PRICING</p>
<p>Price Evaluation is to be performed by the Contract Specialist and Contracting Officer. Vendors are required to submit price quotes in accordance with the proposed CLIN structure. Vendors are to provide firm-fixed pricing for each of the CLIN's as well as a total price for the entire effort. Vendors may quote travel expenses on a cost basis. Travel is going to be considered in the price evaluation.<br />Each offeror's proposed price will be evaluated for reasonableness. The Government currently intends to award a contract for the 1 year base and two years options, therefore the total price of a vendor's proposal will consider the price for all CLINs and the total estimated price for each year and, potentially, the cost of travel.<br />It is the Government's intention to award without negotiating, under lowest price, technically acceptable (LPTA) evaluation approach.<br />FAR 52.212-3, "Offeror Representations and Certification--Commercial Items."

<DESC>Question: What is the delivery time you are looking for regarding these cables?<br />Answer: The standard delivery date is 30 days after contract award.
<p>Question: Do the cables need to be TAA compliant?<br /><br />Answer: According to FAR 25.401, an exception to FAR Subpart 25.4 Trade Agreements is acquisitions set aside for small businesses. This requirement is set aside for small businesses. So, no, TAA compliance does not apply to this<br />acquisition.</p>
<p><br />Question: Could you please indicate what core size and color is needed for the single mode ( LC/SC, SC/SC) Duplex Fiber Optic cables?<br /><br />Answer: These should be standard "9/125" yellow patch cables</p>
<p>Question: It appears this bid is for small, disadvantaged businesses. Since [our company] does not fit that profile, should we just not reply to this Bid?<br /><br />Answer: This is not a small, disadvantaged business set aside. This requirement is set aside 100% for small businesses. There is a distinction between the two types of set asides. As the solicitation states, the NAICS code is 334119 and the size standard is 1,000 employees. If your company does not fall within these standards, your quote will not be considered for award.</p>

 SECTION C - CONTRACT CLAUSES
 
 
 C.1  VAAR 852.203-70 COMMERCIAL ADVERTISING (JAN 2008)
 
   The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor.
 
                              (End of Clause)
 
 C.2  VAAR 852.211-70  SERVICE DATA MANUALS (NOV 1984)
 
   (a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.
 
   (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.
 
   (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions.
 
   (d) Section II, Installation. Section II shall provide pertinent installation information. It shall list all input and output connectors using applicable reference designators and functional names as they appear on the equipment. Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).
 
   (e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.
 
   (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section.
 
   (g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.
 
   (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.
 
   (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches.
 
                            (End of Clause)
 
 C.3  VAAR 852.211-73  BRAND NAME OR EQUAL (JAN 2008)
 
   (Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)
 
   (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.
 
   (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.
 
   (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:
 
       (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and
 
       (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.
 
     (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:
 
       (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and
 
       (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.
 
     (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered.
 
                            (End of Clause)
 
 C.4  VAAR 852.237-70 CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES (APR 1984)
 
   The contractor shall obtain all necessary licenses and/or permits required to perform this work. He/she shall take all reasonable precautions necessary to protect persons and property from injury or damage during the performance of this contract. He/ she shall be responsible for any injury to himself/herself, his/her employees, as well as for any damage to personal or public property that occurs during the performance of this contract that is caused by his/her employees fault or negligence, and shall maintain personal liability and property damage insurance having coverage for a limit as required by the laws of the State of Arizona.

   (As used in this provision, the term ``brand name'' includes identification of products by make and model.)
 
   (a)  If items called for by this solicitation have been identified in the schedule by a ``brand name or equal'' description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is intended to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory.  Offers offering ``equal'' products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the offers and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the solicitation.
 
   (b)  Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that it is offering an ``equal'' product, its offer shall be considered as offering the brand name product referenced in the solicitation.
 
   (c)(1) If the offeror proposed to furnish an ``equal'' product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the offer.  The evaluation of offers and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the offeror or identified in its offer as well as other information reasonably available to the contracting office.
 
   CAUTION TO OFFERORS: The contracting office is not responsible for locating or securing any information which is not identified in the offer and reasonably available to the contracting office.  Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the offeror must furnish as a part of its offer all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, or other information) necessary for the contracting office to: (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the solicitation, and (ii) establish exactly what the offeror proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to acquire by making an award.  The information furnished may include specific reference to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the contracting office.
 
   (2) If the offeror proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the solicitation, it shall: (i) Include in its offer a clear description of such proposed modifications, and (ii) clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.

   (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures.  Award will be made to the technically acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose quote conforms to the requirements.  Technical acceptability will be evaluated on a PASS/FAIL basis.  Include prices for the entire project.  Ensure technical requirements and specifications are met in accordance with (IAW) the Statement of Work (SOW).  Failure to meet any of the requirements may result in rejection of the entire offer.  A partial quote will not be considered.  All offerors shall provide brochures, pictures, pamphlets to demonstrate that their products meet the specifications as stated in this solicitation.  All products must be received no later than 30 days after receipt of order.

Factor 1 - Technical Portion:  Technical acceptability will be evaluated on a PASS/FAIL basis.  Ensure technical requirements and specification are met IAW with the SOW.

Factor 2 - Price: Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for award.  Include prices for the entire project.
Award will be made to the lowest-priced quote meeting the technical acceptability IAW the SOW.
 
   Technical and past performance, when combined, are not applicable.
 
   (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
 
   (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
 
                            (End of Provision)

                           (End of Provision)
 
 E.4  VAAR 852.273-74 AWARD WITHOUT EXCHANGES (JAN 2003)

<DESC>The purpose of amendment 0001 is to incorporate changes into the RIF BAA and answers questions that have been submitted.  The final cut-off date for questions is Friday, October 7, 2011.  <br /><br />The attached Broad Agency Annoucement (BAA) issued under the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subparts 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016, provides for the submission of White Papers in support of the Department of Defense's Rapid Innovation Fund (RIF). The DoD Components participating in this BAA include the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and the Joint Science and Technology Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (CBD). The RIF program was established to facilitate the rapid insertion of innovative technologies into military systems or programs that meet critical national security needs, such as those supporting the resolution of operational challenges characterized by Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONs). The RIF program also intends to facilitate innovative technologies that show a clear transition path to fielding the technology into existing Acquisition Category (ACAT) programs or other defense acquisition programs.

<DESC><p>It is the intent of this solicitation (AG-024B-S-11-0015) to secure a contract for the requirement of a two-phase training course from a parachute training contractor, who is an expert in the use of double bag static line (DBSL) ram air parachute systems. The Forest Service Smokejumper Parachute Development Process and Project Plan require Forest Service smokejumpers to receive expert-level training on parachute systems that are not currently in use before any live jumping. The scope of this project is to train ten FS smokejumpers and two BLM smokejumpers in the use of DBSL ram air parachute systems. This will allow the FS to evaluate similar parachute systems during the parachute development project that is being led by the Missoula Technology and Development Center (MTDC). This training project consists of a two-phase course. The Forest Service needs a group of people experienced in DBSL deployed ram air parachutes to determine if this type of deployment is a viable option and to test this type of system during the parachute development project. The safest, most efficient way to gain this type of experience is through completion of a two-phase training course from a parachute training contractor, who is an expert in the use of DSBL ram air parachute systems.</p>
<p>The solicitation is a total small business set aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code the Government anticipates this requirement will fall under is 314999 (All Other Miscellaneous Textile Product Mills) with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT WAS AMENDED TO CHANGE THE NAICS CODE,&nbsp;CHANGE HAS BEEN&nbsp;BOLDED.<br /><br /></strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 104 Airport Drive, Suite 220, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-1350 to genotype genes involved in the pathogenesis of HPE and fatty liver.</p>
<p><br />The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. NHGRI laboratory has discovered over ten genes associated with HPE and, in doing so, illuminated a number of key molecular processes involved in early embryonic development. NHGRI investigators have since identified a number of additional genes in the Sonic Hedgehog and Nodal signaling pathways that are implicated in HPE. Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is the most common malformation of the human forebrain. Affected individuals can have severe brain malformations and accompanying craniofacial anomalies, but mutation carriers may also be very subtly affected, with only slight facial differences and no other noticeable medical issues (this is often called "microform" HPE). Traditionally, nonsyndromic HPE (regardless of severity) has been thought to be an "above the neck diagnosis" in which only the brain and craniofacial features have any detectable anomalies. The overall objective is to further explore and determine the association between genes involved in the pathogenesis of HPE and fatty liver. The link between mutations in HPE-related genes and fatty liver through the use of a mouse model will be explored with the collaboration with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>
<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has a well-established mouse embryologist with extensive expertise in mouse models of HPE. The laboratory at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill has a long and impressive history of working with mouse models involving HPE-associated genes such as the ones our NIH lab studies. Critically, the North Carolina laboratory embryologist has already established mouse null lines for the HPE-associated genes that appear to be linked to fatty liver. These mouse lines are necessary for timely performance of research into the genetics of fatty liver in order to address our direct research questions. The North Carolina at Chapel Hill embryologist has extensive experience working with these models in the specific ways that our study requires. Due to preliminary work already established at North Carolina, collaborating with their University would significantly aid NHGRI in their studies, thus reducing time in the research due to the breakthrough that has already been accomplished at University of North Carolina at Chapel.<br /><br /><strong>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990,&nbsp;All Other Professiona, Scientific, and Technical Services, with size standard of $7.0M.</strong> The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-53 (August 4, 2011).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by September 16, 2011, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2011-362-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Dorothy Maxwell.

This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/crane/working/contracting/default.aspx. 
FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Contracting webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. 

MODIFICATION 01:

This synopsis/solicitation amendment is posted to update the issue date to 26 January 2011, update the anticipated closing date to 25 February 2011 and modify the procedures that will be used.
  Based on the fact that competition is restricted on this procurement the Government is drafting a contract document rather than making a solicitation available for download.  Interested parties can still obtain a draft copy of the contract, less any business sensitive information, by contacting the point of contact below.  See Synopsis N00164-10-R-GR75 for additional procurement related information.

The POC is J.D. Martin, Code CXMR, at 812-854-3723 or email james.d.martin@navy.mil.

PLEASE REFER TO AMENDMENT FOR DETAILS. **<br /><br />* THE SOLICITATION HAS BEEN POSTED. PLEASE REFER TO THIS DOCUMENT FOR SITE VISIT DATE/TIME AND PROPOSAL DUE DATE. *<br /><br />The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services for the U.S. Embassy Tegucigalpa, Honduras. The U.S. Embassy Tegucigalpa requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The estimated number of annual hours for guard services at this location is approximately 289,600 hours. The Contractor shall be required to provide services that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel; dependents; property; destruction of assets; prevent unauthorized access; and, deter potential terrorist attacks. Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. The Government plans to post the solicitation on this site mid-April 2011. No paper copies will be mailed. The Government will solicit this requirement for full and open competition, using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: The synopsis will be posted for approximately 30 days. Then the solicitation will be posted and the Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) period begins. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately 60 days to submit proposals. All dates are subject to change and Offerors will be notified by registering on https://www.fbo.gov. Site Visit attendance is not mandatory, but highly encouraged. A site visit is expected to be scheduled approximately three weeks after the solicitation is posted. Offerors are responsible for entry visa (if required); all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations in both locations. Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed for the conference and site visit. No questions will be answered concerning this requirement until the solicitation is posted. Once the solicitation is posted, questions may be submitted by email to the Bonnie Allen at allenbj@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. In accordance with 22 U.S.C. Section 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons.

<AWARDEE>Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation, 505 10th Street
, Atlanta, GA 30332 US
<DESC>IAW FAR 5.705(b), the following information is provided as post award synopsis. RFP #FA8523-11-R-30008 was issued on 15 JUN 2011 to procure specialized Engineering Services in support of the C-130 and other large aircraft electronic warfare (EW) systems. The services will include integration of the Enhanced Situational Awareness (ESA), Advanced Situational Awareness and CounterMeasures (ASACM) Sustainment, and improving threat warning capability for several EW systems. Contract number FA8523-11-D-0002 was awarded on 22-SEP-2011 and was not awarded competitively nor using Firm Fixed Price. The award was made Sole Source to Georgia Tech Research Institute because GTRI posses technical data and historical information not available to the Government or other contractors. This expertise, experience, and data make GTRI uniquely qualified to perform this effort. A cost plus fixed fee contract (CPFF) was determined the best contract type because uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract. Appropriate government surveillance is in place to insure that effective methods for cost control and labor efficiency are being used. The place of performance for this contract will be Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, EW/Common Avionics Division, WR-ALC/GRWEAB laboratories.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR USE OF SOLE SOURCE

1. Contracting Activity.
Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Jacksonville
Regional Contracting Department
Jacksonville, FL 32212

2. Description of the Action Being Approved.
Award of a contract on a sole source basis for Household Goods (HHG) services for NAS Key West Florida. 

3. Description of Supplies/Service.
The requirement consists of packing, crating, moving, and storage services for the household goods of DoD personnel in the South Florida Region. The period of performance will consist of a one year period. A firm fixed price contract is anticipated at an estimated value of $90,000.

4. Statutory Authority Permitting SOLE SOURCE.
Authority of 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c)(2) and (3) as implemented by FAR 6.3, Other than Full and Open Competition.

5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority.
This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(2) as implemented by FAR 6.302-2(b)(2), Unusual and Compelling Urgency. NAS Key West needs immediate HHG services. An award was planned for 9 AUG, 2011. HHG service needed to start on August 10, 2011. FLC Jacksonville had solicited offerors via NECO and Fedbizops. The synopsis had been posted from 3 May, 2011 through 2 June, 2011. Two offerors placed bids on the requirement. Only one offeror was deemed technically acceptable. FLC Jacksonville planned to award to the technically acceptable offeror.
 However, the offeror that was to be awarded the contract withdrew their offer on August 9th, 2011 because they plan on closing their Key West warehouse. Services were required to start the next day, August 10th, 2011. This offeror is the incumbent on the current bridge contract. NAS Key West has an immediate need for HHG services since the incumbent has stopped performing the service for this contract on August 9th, 2011. The sole source award will go to Coast to Coast Moving & Storage. 

It has been determined that a one year sole source award will be beneficial to the government. It is expected to take an extended amount of time to re-solicit this requirement in the busiest time of year for contracting.
 Based on the current market research that has been performed, there is only one contractor in the area that is technically acceptable and willing to perform this contract. This has been confirmed by the last solicitation attempt that resulted in a technically unacceptable bidder and a bidder that withdrew at the last moment because they are closing their local area warehouse. Therefore, extra time is needed to perform extensive market research to find additional companies that can meet the requirement.
6. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.
The Contracting Officer will determine the anticipated cost to the Government of the supplies/services covered by this J&A will be fair and reasonable.
 This will be done by comparing the offered rates to those on previously competed contract N68836-07-D-0008, incorrectly awarded contract N68836-10-F-0725, the resulting bridge contract N68836-11-D-0001, the IGCE, and those submitted by the two bids that were received from the synopsis.
7. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition.
After the service is performed on this contract, FLC Jacksonville will compete this requirement as done previously. The requirement will be competed by posting a synopsis and allowing all qualifying contractors to compete for the award.

<DESC>&nbsp; The purpose of the contract is to provide technical assistance to the Government of Timor-Leste through the implementation of the Timor-Leste Health Improvement Project (TL-HIP). The purposes of the Project are to: a) improve reproductive, maternal, neo-natal, and child health (MNCH) behaviors and outcomes; b) improve MNCH, service delivery through Ministry of Health (MOH) service delivery sites; and, c) increase community engagement around key MNCH issues, with emphasis on family planning (FP) in selected districts. The project builds upon 6 years of successful USAID support to the Government of Timor-Leste (GOTL) and the NGO sector in the areas of health systems strengthening, infectious disease prevention, nutrition, food security, Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and FP programming. The project implementation will be prioritized to the districts of Oecusse, Manatuto and Ermera plus two more districts to be identified jointly between USAID, the Contractor and MOH. The HIP will focus its efforts at reaching: Health providers at the district, sub-district and community levels; Women of Reproductive Age (WRA); and Children under five years of age.
<p>&nbsp;TL-HIP will include technical emphasis on the concepts of Safe Motherhood, Neonatal, Child Health and related maternal and infant nutrition in an integrated approach. The program should focus on the following technical areas: Maternal and newborn health; Family Planning; and Child Health. The HIP project will be implemented with full collaboration and buy-in from the MOH at its national, district and community levels.</p>

<AWARDEE>AGILEX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.;5155 PARKSTONE DR;CHANTILLY;VA;201513812
<DESC>On September 27, 2011, the Technology Acquisition Center awarded contract VA118-11-P-0113 to Agilex Technologies, Inc., 5155 Parkstone Drive, Chantilly, Virginia, 20151-3812 on a sole-source basis. This effort is to provide fully disabled Veterans, and Veteran caregivers, with mobile devices that include custom health care applications for data display and patient interaction. These applications are intended to improve communication and the flow of medical data for fully disabled Veterans and Veteran caregivers, while relieving them of the difficult task of transportation to and from VA facilities.  The period of performance for this effort is 12-months, in the total value of $4,970,279.23. The Justification and Approval is below.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
   Office of Acquisition and Logistics
         Technology Acquisition Center
         260 Industrial Way West
         Eatontown, NJ 07724
      
2.  Description of Action:  This proposed action is for a firm-fixed price contract with a one (1) year period of performance for development services and hardware required to support the "Clinic-in-Hand" effort.
3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  This proposed action is intended to establish VA's first patient-facing mobile health application that is integrated with the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) systems Electronic Health Record.  To establish this application, VA requires development services and hardware to ensure the application will work.  The goal of this pilot is to place veterans and veteran caregivers at the center of their health care through the use of mobile technology.  Should the project be successful, the need to transport these fully disabled veterans to VA medical centers or clinics for treatment or evaluation will be significantly reduced.  The "Clinic-in-Hand" effort will build on the iHealth Adapter capability which facilitates the extraction of health data from VistA systems.  "Clinic-in-Hand" applications will extract key medical information from VistA systems via the iHealth Adapter and disseminate that information to homebound veterans and their caregivers through applications built to run on mobile devices.  The "Clinic-in-Hand" effort  will expand the iHealth Adapter data interfaces beyond the current patient record extracts currently under development, create mobile health care applications, procure mobile devices for data display and patient interaction, populate those devices with extracted health data, and provide the customized devices to the initial test population of fully disabled veterans and veteran caregivers.  These applications are intended to improve communication and the flow of medical data for fully disabled veterans and veteran caregivers, while relieving them of the difficult task of transportation to and from VA facilities.  The total estimated price of the proposed action is $4,995,572.80. 
                        
4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."
5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  The proposed source for this action is Agilex Technologies, Inc. (Agilex), 5155 Parkstone Drive, Chantilly, Virginia 20151-3812.  Agilex is in the process of developing and testing a unique and innovative concept called the iHealth Adapter, which is an open source, scalable, standards-based framework for mobile healthcare computing and multitasking focused on VA clinical data services and secure mobile devices.  The iHealth Adapter is a unique and innovative concept in that it provides a set of common services to interact with VistA systems, and provides information to mobile devices for use at point-of-care.  Currently the healthcare data exchange between VistA systems and a mobile device has only been accomplished utilizing the iHealth Adapter.  This was accomplished under a Broad Agency Announcement with Agilex.  The iHealth Adapter is currently in development and testing under the existing Agilex contract, therefore the source code has not yet been finalized and accepted by the Government.  No other vendor has the required source code and knowledge of the iHealth Adapter to make the necessary modifications and extended applications required to meet the timeframe defined by VA for expanded support of fully disabled veterans.  This assessment is based on responses to a Request for Information (RFI).  Any other source other than Agilex would be required to modify or build a new interface to VistA systems for communication with mobile devices. Modification of the iHealth Adapter without access to the source code is not possible.  This would result in extensive delivery delays and duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition.  Specifically, the Veterans Health Administration Chief Information Technology Architect has analyzed existing and past interface development efforts and determined that the development cycle required would take between six (6) months and three (3) years for similar efforts.  Once that work is complete, the vendor would then have to build the more complex data retrieval and write the source code into the VistA system that this proposed effort requires.  Certification and Accreditation (C&A) would then be required for these programs and would require an additional six (6) months of elapsed time. These extensive delivery delays do not address the VA priority of immediately improving remote healthcare support to fully disabled veterans.  There are currently approximately 3,000 fully disabled veterans in the VA patient base, and significantly more seriously disabled veterans.  The capability to assist these veterans remotely is a critical and significant improvement not only to the discomfort and logistics of transportation to and from medical facilities, but to the immediacy of response to their healthcare issues.  
In summary, given Agilex's expertise in developing and deploying the iHealth Adapter, it is the only source capable of expanding upon this work.  It would not be possible for another vendor to make enhancements to the iHealth Adapter since Agilex is the creator, and the source code has yet to be accepted by the Government.  No other vendor has the knowledge or expertise with the iHealth Adapter required to perform this work.  Given the Government's estimate that it would take between one (1) to three (3) years for another source to develop and obtain the aforementioned C&A for a new interface to the VistA system for mobile devices, no other source is capable of performing this effort in the critical timeframe needed.  Failure to provide this capability as soon as possible would significantly impact the ability of VA medical support to provide critically needed health care to fully disabled veterans.
6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements.  There is no competition anticipated for this acquisition.  Additionally, the proposed action will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO) in accordance with FAR 5.201.  Any proposals that are received shall be evaluated.  Furthermore, this Justification and Approval will be made publicly available on the FBO Page.    
7.   Actions to Increase Competition:  Given an initial successful implementation of the "Clinic-in-Hand" effort, the VA would then plan to roll out this capability to the large numbers of injured or ailing veterans who could benefit from this form of remote medical support.  Subsequent development and roll-out of "Clinic-in-Hand" applications can be competed since the iHealth Adapter source code will be available to all developers at that point.  The Government anticipates accepting the iHealth Adapter source code in January 2012.  Once the iHealth Adapter source code is accepted from Agilex, and this sole source effort is completed, VA will have all of the documentation necessary to compete all future iHealth Adapter related work.  All future applications to be included in this program will be competed by utilizing the aforementioned source code.
8.  Market Research: Redacted.
9.  Other Facts:  None

As the project ends, it is necessary to replace the hard drives to repurpose the servers.  The hardware will replace classified components for servers in support of a research project.  The current configuration of the USSC file servers installed within the network server is composed of components manufactured by Dell.  The specifications developed for the domain controllers were specifically designed so as to not disrupt the network server and maintain a manufacturer's component continuity within the network file server.

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 06, Salem, VA Medical Center, 1601 Brenner Ave., Salem, VA 28144 intends to award a sole source contract by means Other than Full and Open Competition.  VA Form 2237 number 658-11-4-5257-0927.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This is a request for other than full and open competition to procure the services of contingency laundry service. This will be a firm fixed price contract to Carillon Laundry Service. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agencys Needs:  This is a short term contingency effort from September 15, 2011 through December 31, 2011. Contingency Laundry Service will process an estimated 15, 000 pounds of laundry per day during VAMC Salem Laundry Service transitional period. Services shall include pick-up and delivery of items by Contractor personnel. This service is in support of patient care. This is a Contractor owned/Contractor operated bulk laundry/linen services and tasks requirement.  An interim contract with Carilion Laundry Service is to help in the continued development and installation of a new laundry plant in support of patient care.  Carilion Laundry service continued supportive service is beneficial for the continuity of both the short and long-term completion of the laundry plant plans for Salem VAMC.  The estimated cost is $250,000.00.  
      The contractor will provide the following services:
	Collaborate with VAMC Salem staff in creating an assistive contingency laundry plan for pick-up, and delivery during the New Plant transitional period. 
	Provide all personnel, supplies, transpiration and services needed to provide complete contingency laundry service.
	Work closely with VAMC Salem staff and other key partners to develop and implement solutions to laundry problems that may accrue for service members and Veterans.
	Schedule employee meetings as needed for innovative ways to improve service in support of VAMC new laundry plant completion.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractors Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   The contractor has over 20 years of professional laundry experience serving large facilities to include hospitals in the Salem Virginia area.   VAMC Salem has identified Carilion Laundry service as an expert in production laundry service through contacts in the Salem community and VA past performance.  The pool for qualified production laundry service providers in the Salem area is limited.  Carilion Laundry service specializes in bulk production service while implementing large facility laundry solutions. This is a short trim contractual requirement for an unusual and compelling urgency. Due to VAMC Salem laundry renovation contractor not being able to timely deliver or install new laundry machinery has caused a timely delay and a contingency need at no fault of VAMC Salem. Delay in award of a new contract would result in serious patient, procedure and clinic delays and/or closures. This alone would cause serious financial lost along with patient care risk.   Carilion Laundry service is a proven, professional cost effective company with the ability to continue all laundry service as required and needed in such a compelling time.  

6.	Determination of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: Salem is in the process of renovating and updating its own laundry. Construction and delivery delays have necessitated this short term contingency effort from September 15, 2011 through December 31, 2011. Contingency Laundry Service will process and estimated 15,000 pounds of laundry per day during VAMC Salems laundry service transitional period in direct support of patient care. Carilion Laundry has been providing supplemental service while construction has been in progress.   

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Carilion Laundry service rates are at a fair and reasonable cost in comparison to past history. Contracting Officer relied on the following to evaluate price fairness: historical data-FY11 Purchase Order# 658-P17989 which was a competitive award. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  None conducted due to the urgent and compelling nature of the requirement.  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Carilion Laundry service is familiar with the hospital and will provide expert service following the requirements stipulated by the Chief, Environmental Management based on the policy, procedures, rules and regulations of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Contractor is fully capable and familiar with hospital operations. 

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None.   

11.	  A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to 
  Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: Future 
  requirements that are not urgent will be competed.

  Fide Need of the Department of Veterans  Affairs and that the supporting data under my 
  cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my
