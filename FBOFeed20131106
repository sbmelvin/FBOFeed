<DESC>Arcata has A Requirement for 1 each IADS-TELEM-SITE, Maintenance Renewal. Arcata Associates, Inc intends to purchase the items from SYMVIONICS, Inc., Telemetry Systems 190 Sierra Court Suite A3 Palmdale, CA 93550 This item is software used for the display and analysis of flight test data.  IADS (Interactive Display and Analyis System).  This software is used in the mission control centers at NASA Dryden and has been for over 10 years. This purchase is for the annual license maintenance.  The annual license renewal has occurred every year since 2002. There is no other source that provides the capabilities of this product.  The impact is millions of dollars in software development.  It would requires the purchase of a new telemetry system, the rewriting of approximately 12 in-house developed applications that interface into the telemetry system, which in-turn interfaces to IADS. There are annual reviews of the market to evaluate products that provide similar capabilities.  To date none have come close to providing the capabilities provided by IADS.  As such, IADS has become the defacto standard for flight test across all of DoD. Arcata Associates, Inc does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Questions concerning this notice can be sent to DFRC-Arcata-Procurement@mail.dfrc.nasa.gov and must be received by 2:00 p.m. pacific time on November 12, 2013.	Question submitted after this time will not be accepted.  Answers to questions will be posted no later than 2:00 P.M. on November 15, 2013. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities, qualifications and pricing to perform this effort in writing via email to DFRC-Arcata-Procurement@mail.nasa.gov no later than 2:00 p.m. pacific time on November 21, 2013.  Such proposals will be submitted to the evaluation team for review.

<DESC>NASA Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville, AL solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. &lt;p&gt; THE TECHNOLOGY: &lt;p&gt; Scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center have developed a set of unique magnetostrictive (MS) technologies for utilization in pressure regulation and valve systems. By combining MS-based sensors with a newly designed MS-based valve, Marshall has developed an advanced MS regulator. This innovative approach provides both a regulator and a valve with rapid response times. In addition, the components are lightweight, compact, highly precise, and can operate over a wide range of temperatures and pressures.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC/Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) has a requirement for the Implementation of a back-up capability for the WFF High Gain UHF Ground Station.	This implementation requires changing the frequency range of an existing groundstation, capable of full-motion tracking of low earth orbit satellites, with low Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) interference, and high availability, to support CubeSats using the UHF band. The requirement is for a UHF feed system to be built, installed and tested to cover the 400-470 MHz band, minimum 35 dB gain, that does not conflict with the other frequency band operations of the existing groundstation.	 NASA/GSFC/WFF intends to purchase the items from Morehead State University, pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one known source.  Morehead State is the only known source that owns a large diameter aperture groundstation that satisfies the requirements to track earth orbiting satellites, has high availability, low interference, and can be modified for UHF.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 21, 2013. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.

  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps or by calling the NAVSUP WSS PCO.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

Ft. (ABOA) Minimum: 19,850<br />Sq. Ft. (ABOA) Maximum: 20,843<br />Sq. Ft. (RSF): 22,232<br />Space Type: Office and related space<br />Parking : N/A<br />Total Lease Term: 5 years<br />Firm Term: 5 years<br />Additional Requirements: Subleases are not acceptable. <br /><br />The Government intends to use this information from prospective sources to issue a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP).
<p>The Government currently occupies leased office and related space that will be expiring.</p>
<p>Buildings offered for consideration must be within the defined delineated area as shown above and have the ability to meet all current Federal/GSA/PBS, State, and Local codes and regulations including, but not limited to, fire and life safety, handicapped accessibility, OSHA, and sustainability standards by the required occupancy date per the terms of the Lease. The proposed leased space shall be fully serviced. Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p><br />Expressions of Interest must be received in writing no later than November 15, 2013 at 5:00 PM EST, and should include the following information at a minimum.<br />(This is not an invitation for bids or a request for proposals):</p>
<p>&bull; Building name and address;<br />&bull; Location of space in the building and date of availability;<br />&bull; Rentable Square Feet (RSF) offered and rate per RSF;<br />&bull; ANSI/BOMA office area (ABOA) square feet and rental rate per ABOA, full service, meeting GSA's standard building shell requirements;<br />&bull; Scaled floor plans (as-built) identifying offered space;<br />&bull; The date that the space will be available;<br />&bull; Site plan showing parking area(s) and loading area(s);<br />&bull; Name, address, telephone number, and email address of authorized contact.<br />&bull; Evidence of ability to meet the required occupancy date of March, 2014.</p>
<p>Owners, brokers, or agents may offer space for consideration. Any properties submitted by brokers or agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized by the ownership to exclusively represent the building offered.</p>
<p>Projected Dates:</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest Due: November 15, 2013<br />Market Survey (Estimated): December, 2013<br />Offers Due (Estimated): January, 2014<br />Occupancy (Estimated): March, 2014</p>
<p>Authorized Contacts:</p>
<p>GSA is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in lease negotiations for this transaction. In no event shall the Offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning this space requirement with any Federal Agency other than the offices and employees of the General Services Administration (GSA) or their authorized representative, DTZ Americas, Inc.</p>
<p>Interested parties should send expressions of interest to:</p>

<a href="mailto:kristen.kachur@us.army.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>Request for Information on Bi-Static Frequency Domain Electromagnetic Sensor Systems for Cavity Detection <br>  <br> The U.S Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, on behalf of the US Technical Support Working Group (TSWG), is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for the state-of-the-art technology, within industry, in the area of Bi-Static Frequency Domain EM systems to identify the position, extent and depth of underground resistors (cavities or voids).  The TSWG is seeking sources interested in providing information and subject matter expertise on how to build, integrate, and deliver a state-of-the-art Bi-Static Frequency Domain EM (BSFDEM) sensor system that can identify the position, extent and depth of subsurface cavities and other resistive subsurface targets of interest.  The goal is to provide a BSFDEM that can identify the position, extent and depth of cavities with both high probability of detection and localization accuracy that is able to be transported, assembled, operated and disassembled by a two man team with all operators and components transported in a single vehicle.  <br>  <br> The BSFDEM sensor system is composed of a magnetic field transmitter (TX), magnetic field sensors (RX), a highly accurate GPS unit (or units) and a processing unit. The Bi-Static system should include a transmitter that will be located at some distance from the void location. The transmitted field will interact with subsurface materials, both conductive and resistive, causing perturbations in the magnetic field(s) measured by the multiple magnetic field sensors. The processing unit should communicate with the magnetic field sensors and the GPS unit(s) to digitize and record the magnetic field data from the sensors and combine this data with the GPS location information. <br>  <br> The system should be composed primarily of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components to facilitate ease of obtaining parts and repair in austere locations supported primarily by local commercial vendors.   <br>  <br> The estimated performance of the transmitter (TX), receiver sensing system (RX) and GPS are detailed in the following paragraphs. Responders are encouraged to review and propose changes in the proposed design in order to achieve performances that exceed those definitions of the system. System size, weight, power, cost, reliability and ease of operation are major factors that will be reviewed.  <br>  <br> The transmitter (TX) should be able to emit continuous waveforms in the range 1 kHz to 1000 kHz in increments of no more than 50 kHz.  Multiple waveforms/frequencies simultaneously would be preferred.  The TX output should be adjustable and have a magnetic moment of at least 10 Amp meters (A?m); however, the TX power cannot be so strong as to interfere with FCC (or location equivalent) transmission restrictions.  The TX needs to be reasonably portable, requiring no more than two individuals to position and set up.  TX power supply must be portable (e.g., rechargeable battery). <br>  <br> The receiver (RX) component should be capable of sensing continuous waveforms in the range 1 kHz to 1000 kHz.  Multiple waveforms/frequencies simultaneously would be preferred.  24-bit A/D resolution is required.  The RX component must be lightweight (less than 25 lbs) such that it is man-portable with the potential option to vehicle-mount or tow the RX.  Power supply should be integrated into sensor. <br>  <br> System setup time should be less than 0.5 hours and any subsequent system calibration or configuration changes should take no more than 10-15 minutes.  The system should be able to be transported to/from a survey site by a passenger vehicle (e.g., van).  The system is required to yield a sensitivity of 10 femtotesla (fT) or better with a noise level of approximately 1 fT/Hz1/2.  Output of the system must be at a minimum of 10 Hz and reflect the least amount of signal processing necessary.  EM data should be geotagged with GPS position data having accuracy better than 20 cm.  Raw data storage should be internal to the system (hard memory, solid state drive). Access to the data should be easy and simple (e.g. USB port, SD card, etc.). Redundant data storage would be preferred with the raw data being stored to more than one on board storage location or sent to another storage device wirelessly. During operation the user should be provided system health messages onscreen (e.g. battery life, proper data storage, GPS operational, etc.) During operation the user should be provided real-time data onscreen.  The system must be able to run continuously for a minimum of 2 hours and function in extreme weather, with temperatures ranging from 0 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit.   <br>  <br> Sensors must be software controllable through the processing unit with an integrated Graphical User Interface (GUI).   <br>  <br> Government purpose rights for all source and compiled code is encouraged (and may be required) as part of any system. <br>  <br> Responses to this RFI must be unclassified. Responses should be submitted no later than 1700 hours on 06 December 2013.  <br>  <br> Electronic responses are to be in Adobe PDF or Microsoft Word format using a size 12 font with one inch margins.  Adobe PDF format is preferred.  Responses should include a cover letter and at a minimum, provide the following: <br>  <br>     1. A cover letter (optional) <br> 2. A cover page labeled with the heading  BSFDEM for Cavity Detection, name of company, name of corporate point of contact (POC), name of technical POC, telephone number for each POC, full mailing address, e-mail addresses for each POC, CAGE Code, and any other pertinent information.  <br> 3. No more than fifteen pages of technical information including: <br> (a) Component and system technical descriptions, system block diagram and estimated performance <br> (b) Narrative describing how the specified technical requirements would be addressed and fulfilled <br> (c) Corporate competencies and past performance experience with regard to development and modification of commercial systems including relevant history of ability to develop and integrate similar technologies <br> (d) Rough estimate of costs and timeline <br> (e) An indication as to whether the technology is sufficiently mature to build and demonstrate, or whether additional development would be more appropriate prior to a subsequent build. Prefer technology solutions with readiness levels that can support production and fielding within the next two years. <br> (f) Describe any Independent Research and Development (IRAD) programs applicable to this RFI regarding government modified commercial systems for applications such as this. <br> (g) changes in the proposed design to achieve performances that exceed definitions of the system   <br> 4. Specification sheets and product information may also be provided in addition to the Response. <br>  <br> Please submit all pages as a single (.doc or .pdf) file.  Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED.  Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. <br>  <br> This request for information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or a commitment by the U.S. Government.  The U.S. Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of the market survey. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a separate solicitation notice will be published.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  <br>  <br> All responsible, interested sources are encouraged to submit their capabilities/qualification data along with any questions no later than 06 December 2013 to the following: U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey(ACC-NJ), ATTN: Kristen Kachur, ACC-NJ-ET, Building 9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, email: kristen.e.kachur.civ@mail.mil.

<SUBJECT>Air Pollution and Respiratory Health Branch (APRHB), Reducing Mold and Dampness in Buildings
<SOLNBR>2014-N-15772
<RESPDATE>112113
<CONTACT>Liubov A. Kriel, Phone 7704882856, Email vyh1@cdc.gov
<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction.</span></strong> This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span></strong> a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The NACIS code for this acquisition is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services with a size standard of $14M.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background.</span></strong> The Air Pollution and Respiratory Health Branch (APRHB) National Asthma Control Program (NACP) is responsible for technical oversight, assistance, and funding of national asthma surveillance and ensuring that scientific information is translated into programs that reduce the burden of asthma. The Branch partners and works closely with all levels of federal, state, and local governments, academic institutions, private and non-private organizations, health professionals, and community members to set scientific agendas to reduce the burden of asthma and prevent respiratory illness and deaths related to air pollution. <br /><br />In recent years, scientific knowledge about the effects and extent of mold and dampness in buildings has increased substantially. Evident, subjectively-evaluated mold and dampness are consistently associated with an increase in multiple respiratory and allergic diseases in both allergic and non-allergic individuals, while no specific measured microbiologic factors have such consistent associations. The available data indicate that evident mold and dampness are common in buildings. The estimated burden of disease - e.g., new asthma, asthma exacerbation, allergic rhinitis, respiratory infections - related to current levels of mold and dampness is substantial, but is also potentially preventable by reducing evident mold and dampness. The available scientific evidence therefore supports new efforts to establish public policies that institutionalize best practices for preventing, and remediating dampness and mold in buildings. <br /><br />While some states and localities have adopted laws and regulations directly addressing mold and dampness over the past 10-15 years, the potential for public policy to play a significant role in preventing and reducing disease remains largely unrealized. The damage to public health and property caused by Hurricane Sandy and other recent storms underscores the need for further assessment and development of state and local policies.<br />&nbsp;<br />Moreover, the APRHB of the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) lead CDC's fight against environmental-related respiratory illnesses, including asthma, and studies indoor and outdoor air pollution. The mission of the APRHB is to reduce the burden of non-infectious respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, carbon monoxide, and other air related pollutants, and to undertake emergency response activities to prevent respiratory illness related to indoor and outdoor air pollution. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives.</span></strong> The purpose of this project is to plan and disseminate a broad report that will address laws and policies focused on mold and dampness in homes and schools. The information gathered would be publicly disseminated in a report that explains the basis in existing public health science research for strengthening public policies, and highlights important considerations and recommendations for policymakers, public officials, and other stakeholders. In addition, the information would form the basis for an article for publication in a journal aimed at public health professionals.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Requirements.</span></strong> The APRHB conducts long-and short-term environmental health studies and provides technical assistance to states, other federal agencies to respond to disease and disasters and implement interventions and prevention programs. The APRHB requires support in innovative, project management, study design, data analysis, database development, evaluation, health communication and policy solutions to enable the NACP to further advance its environmental progress by building skills, analyzing complex environmental challenges, and disseminating information through print and electronic media. <br /><br />The potential requirement will include the following tasks:<br /><br />a. Explain the basis in existing public health science for linking mold and dampness to respiratory health effects; estimating the current extent of mold and dampness problems in buildings, and estimating the magnitude of the current burden of human disease linked to mold and dampness, to justify actions to strengthen public policies;<br />b. Describe in detail and analyze key state and local laws including building codes that address prevention and also remediation of mold and dampness in schools and homes;<br />c. Present case studies on state and local approaches to policy implementation - e.g., strategies for effective housing code enforcement, school facility inspection programs; <br />d. Recommend future science and policy research needs for supporting improved policies; and <br />e. Highlight key considerations and recommendations for establishing new and revised policies.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated period of performance.</span></strong> The period of performance will be one year from date of award.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Important Considerations.</span></strong> None<br /><br /><strong>Capability Statement/Information Sought. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PAGE LIMIT 8 PAGES</span>.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for Market Research and thus is for information and planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this Notice. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Notice. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this evaluation. Capability statements will not be returned and will not be accepted after the due date. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).
<p>Description:<br />The Office of Innovation and Improvement (OII) is a nimble, entrepreneurial arm of the U.S. Department of Education (ED).  It makes strategic investments in innovative educational practices through more than 30 discretionary grant programs and coordinates the public school choice and supplemental educational services provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).  OII leads ED efforts to accelerate the development and broad adoption of new programs, processes, and strategies that will lead to significantly improved educational achievement for all American children.  OII works to encourage innovation both externally and internally, through direct investment in high-need areas and by building ED's internal capacity to support innovative solutions. <br /> <br />In 2010, OII launched Promise Neighborhoods (PN) as the first federal initiative to put education at the center of comprehensive efforts to fight poverty in urban and rural areas. The PN initiative is a federal place-based initiative intended to turn neighborhoods of concentrated poverty into neighborhoods of opportunity. The PN program has a strong commitment to and reliance on results-based planning and improvement using real-time data.    To address the challenges faced by students living in communities of concentrated poverty, PN grantees and their partner organizations are required to provide services from early learning to college and career, including programs to improve the health, safety, and stability of neighborhoods, and boost family engagement in student learning.  To date, OII has awarded 12 five year implementation grants and 35 one year planning grants.  In FY 2011 the first cohort of five grantees were awarded implementation grants and in FY 2012 the second cohort of seven grantees were awarded implementation grants.  These funds went directly to nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher education and communities-including major metropolitan areas, small and medium-size cities, rural areas, and Indian reservations-to support cradle-to-career services designed to improve educational outcomes for students in distressed neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), Federal agencies must establish performance goals and performance indicators for their programs. Accordingly, PN grantees are required to collect and report data on 15 distinct performance measures which were created by the Department.  In an effort to demonstrate value and impact, the Department is then responsible for aggregating and analyzing this data across sites for reporting to Congress.  This is done on an annual basis.</p>
<p>Additionally, a core expectation for the PN grantees is that each community will see a substantial increase in the number of youth and families served over time.  In collecting the required data for the 15 performance measures, PN grantees will need to collect a wide variety of data at different levels of observation (e.g., individual-, school-, and neighborhood-level data) and from different sources for GPRA reporting. PN grantees are expected to collect and track key program and outcome data for their participating and targeted children, youth, and families.  PN grantees are also expected to use data to guide their own internal performance management and evaluation.  This includes strategic thinking around defining results, performance measures and strategies; connecting with numerous partner agencies, sharing data, and learning from similar organizations; and, tracking performance in real and over time, using data along the way to make decisions, drive strategies and create impact.</p>
<p>In order to meet its Congressional reporting requirements established under the GPRA; as well as hold accountable the multiple lead organizations and several hundred partner-agencies and organizations responsible for the large-scale, long-term coordinated set of services and programing mandated by the PN initiative, it is critical that the Department provide the PN grantees with the tools and resources needed to be successful.  To assist in this effort the Department has identified the need for a data platform which will create real-time, interactive data dashboards to monitor progress against the 10 results and 15 indicators addressed by each grantee as part of their proposed implementation strategy.  Additionally, this platform would connect all the partner organizations; hold their data; and share and track performance achievements.</p>
<p>Under this contract, the contractor shall provide a software, data platform (Promise Scorecard) that uses a results based framework to capture short and long term performance measures, including the 15 GPRA measures established by the Department.  This contractor will also provide training and technical assistance (TTA) using the results based accountability framework to PN grantees.  The results based accountability TTA will focus on skill development, knowledge transfer, and performance measurement. The Contractor will provide assistance in many ways, including one-on-one consultation, group sessions, on-line training, in-person meetings and during conferences through written and web-based products. The primary focus of the TTA is to use the platform (Promise Scorecard) to collect data that drives results at the local level and assists in holding partners and staff accountable for those results. The goals of the platform (Promise Scorecard) and associated technical assistance include:</p>
<p>&bull;	Increasing productivity and output by grantees;<br />&bull;	Enhancing staff and partner skills and knowledge;<br />&bull;	Ensuring data input particularly for GPRA measures;<br />&bull;	Promoting adoption of best practices;<br />&bull;	Sharing information and resources; and<br />&bull;	Assessing the level of knowledge and skill in Results Based Accountability</p>
<p>Objective: <br />This Request for Information (RFI) is to seek capability statements from potential small business offerors.  If a potential offeror has an applicable Federal Supply Schedule, specific mention including the GSA contract number should be included with the capability statement.  ED anticipates a Fixed Price Performance-Based Acquisition (PBA) with mission-oriented objectives.</p>
<p>Structure of Responses:<br />Offerors should submit capability statements in response to this RFI by e-mail (only) to the Contract Specialist, Elizabeth Price, copying the Contracting Officer, Pamela Bone, by November 13, 2013, 1:00 p.m., EST. Responses should be limited to a maximum of 10 pages, using 12 point font, and include Company Name, DUNS Number, Company Address, Point of Contact, Telephone Number, e-mail Address, and Size of your Organization as validated via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).</p>
<p>Interested parties should include resumes of key personnel who will work on the project in the appendix; these resumes will not be counted as one of the 10 pages of the capability statement.</p>
<p>If any of the qualifications or experience described in the contractor's capability statement is met through consultants or subcontractors, the contractor shall provide evidence of the commitment of these consultants or subcontractors to work on this project.   The contractor also shall describe its experience in identifying and managing multiple consultants and subcontractors for different tasks.</p>
<p>The Small Business Administration (SBA) uses the North American Industry<br />Classification System (NAICS) Codes to establish size standards on an industry by industry basis. The suggested NAICS code for this acquisition is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services.  The size standard for this code is based on average annual receipts of $14,000,000 for three most recent completed fiscal years. Based on the size standard established, please provide whether or not your company is classified as a small business.</p>

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND:<br /></strong>The Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) at The National Library of Medicine offers a variety of toxicological and environmental health databases to the public through the web including the ChemIDplus database. The files are built and maintained by the National Library of Medicine. The database is updated every day, and new features and data are required to be kept in synchronization for the users. This is very important because the ChemIDplus points to over 100 internet resources, including Toxline and PubMed, and is heavily used. A specialized component of the ChemIDplus database is the chemical structure data and search capability. Specifically, 2D structures are entered and updated, and 3D chemical structures and structure identifiers must be generated from these structures for the database. Moreover, the loading of these structures must be incorporated into the database maintenance system to allow public access and searching of these structures by scientist, professionals and the general public.<br /><br /><strong>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:<br /></strong>The Division of Specialized Information Services at NLM requires professional services for integration, analysis and development of chemical structure data and software with the ChemIDplus database system. The purpose is to generate 3D chemical structures and other chemical structure identifiers, including Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification (SMILES) and International Chemical Identifier (InChI) and its corresponding InChiKey for incorporation into the database. Also, professional services are required to assist database web developers with complex code to integrate chemical structure software within the database maintenance system. <br /><br /><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:<br /></strong>1. Maintain 3D structures using Corina for all compounds in ChemIDplus.<br />2. Maintain SMILES strings and InChI strings and keys for all compounds.<br />3. Maintain maintenance program to generate these data when a structure is entered or modified.<br />4. Modify maintenance and retrieval web pages as needed for new features in ChemIDplus.<br />5. Run the program Accelrys Cheshire to systematize the representation of chemical structures in ChemIDplus using a web interface.<br />6. Ensure proper editing and normalizing of chemical structures for accurate database querying and rendering.<br /><br /><strong>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:<br /></strong>The estimated award date is 12/1/2013 - 11/30/2014 with two 12-month Option Years.<br /><br /><strong>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS<br /></strong>The proposed acquisition will be procured in accordance with the policies and procedures under FAR 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine. This Sources Sought Notice is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.<br />Interested firms responding to this Sources Sought Notice must adhere to the following:

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Philadelphia District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $100 million) construction project: <br>  <br> Beachfill, Long Beach Island, Ocean County, New Jersey  <br>  <br> Project Description: Contract work is to provide hurricane and storm damage reduction.  The proposed work will include: <br>  <br> A base bid to place approximately 8,000,000 cubic yards of beachfill to repair the dune and berm system along the Atlantic Ocean coastline of Long Beach Island, Ocean County, New Jersey.  The project area encompasses the municipalities of Long Beach Township, Ship Bottom Borough, Beach Haven Borough, and small portions of the Boroughs of Surf City and Harvey Cedars.  The contract work may also consist of separate options to place additional amounts of beachfill per option, if awarded, in locations within and outside of the Base bid areas.  The project work for the Base Bid and Options, if awarded, also may include, in addition to beachfill, the construction or repair of pedestrian, vehicle, and handicap dune crossovers; planting dune grass; providing sand fencing; and the relocation or removal of various existing structures to accommodate the beachfill and dunes.  The beachfill material for this contract must come from the authorized borrow area located approximately 2.5 - 3.5 miles offshore of Long Beach Island in the Atlantic Ocean, which will be designated on the contract drawings.  Project will also include pre-placement and post-placement condition surveys; environmental modifications and monitoring as needed depending on the season; Munitions and Explosives of Concern (MEC) modifications and monitoring; and structures monitoring <br>  <br> Range of Magnitude: Over $100,000,000.00 <br>  <br> Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are: <br>  <br> a.	The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br> b.	The complexity of the project.  <br> c.	Shortage of skilled labor in the region. <br> d.	Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br> e.	The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area. <br> f.	The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.  <br> g.	The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <br> h.	Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).  <br>  <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br> a.	Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> b.	An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will  <br>  <br> 1.	Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br>  <br> 2.	Be consistent with law.  Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs.  Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:   <br>  <br> a.	Should a PLA be executed on the above described Beachfill, Long Beach Island, Ocean County, New Jersey Project?  What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the Beachfill project? <br>  <br> b.	Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency?  If so, how?  What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA?  Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer? <br>  <br> c.	Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project?  Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?  Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve? <br>  <br> d.	Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project?  Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area?  Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <br>  <br> e.	This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades.  Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br>  <br> f.	Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?  Are there large scale construction projects in the area which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project?  What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? <br>  <br> g.	How will a PLA impact the completion time?  Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br> h.	Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <br>  <br> i.	Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small business utilization goals? <br>  <br> THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ANY COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitations announcements separately from responses to this market survey. <br>  <br> Please provide your comments via email to Michelle Bertoline, Contract Specialist, at Michelle.J.Bertoline@usace.army.mil  no later than 4:00 P.M.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

Chief Business Office (CBO) Consolidated Patient Account Center (CPAC) - Insurance Identification (ID)

1.  Scope:  The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) CBO CPAC is looking to establish a contract with a Contractor to establish off-site health Insurance ID support for all Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN's).  The Contractor shall  identify and validate billable health insurance for Veterans who are treatment at the Veteran Administration (VA) that have no health insurance information on file, update the Veterans Information System Technology Architecture (VISTA) database with the new information obtained, establish and maintain a productive cost-effective Insurance ID system, incorporate industry standard performance metrics, monitor the accuracy and timeliness of VISTA, establish a reporting mechanism that measures return on investment that is in line with negotiated performance metrics; and to allow VISN and Veteran Administration Medical Centers (VAMC's) to meet and/or exceed their Medical Care Collection Fund (MCCF) goals by optimizing third (3rd) party reimbursements, in part through aggressive, accurate and timely Insurance ID.  The Contractor shall work with the Program Office (PO) and Contracting Officer Representative (COR) to identify and validate billable health insurance for Veteran's and to provide recommendations for Insurance ID.  At no time shall the Contractor direct, change, or engage in the formulation of VHA policy.  The VHA is solely responsible to review the Contractor's recommendations and to make decisions concerning the formulation of policy.  

2.  Background:  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has historically relied on contract services in an effort to improve collections through ID and validation of Veterans' third (3rd) party insurance.  In procuring those services, the VA has been free to seek required services from any number of capable Contractors.  

2.1 The VA's CPAC's are responsible for billing to and collecting from insurance companies for medical treatment provided to Veterans for non-service connected conditions.  There are seven (7) regional CPACs located as follows:

1. Asheville, NC - Mid-Atlantic CPAC (MACPAC)
2. Murfreesboro, TN - Mid-South CPAC (MSCPAC)
3. Orlando, FL - Florida Caribbean CPAC (FCCPAC)
4. Madison, WI - North Central CPAC (NCCPAC)
5. Lebanon, PA - North East CPAC (NECPAC)
6. Leavenworth, KS - Central Plains CPAC (CPCPAC)
7. Las Vegas, NV - West CPAC (WCPAC)

 
Note:  The above numbers and colors correspond to VISN regions

2.2 Public Law 99-272 gave the VA authority to seek reimbursement from third party health insurers for the cost of medical care furnished to an insured non-service connected (NSC) Veteran.  Public Law 101-508 expanded the VA's recovery program by providing authority to seek reimbursement from third (3rd) party payers for the cost of medical care provided to insured service-connected Veterans treated for their NSC conditions.  

3. Period of Performance (POP):  The POP shall be from the date of award for a one (1) twelve (12) month base period-year period, and four (4) concurrent twelve (12) month option years.

Accounts for which new insurance information has been identified shall be entered in the "buffer file" which shall be made available and accessed by the Contractor in the VISTA system.  This file shall be used as the main delivery system available for the Contractor to deliver identified and validated insurance information.  Those accounts not containing valid, billable insurance information shall be completed as defined by the VISTA system. 

4.1 At minimum, data fields required for insurance validation are listed in Attachment A.  Any updates to required data fields shall be noted on each Task Order (TO). 

4.2 Expectations regarding approximate volume of claims shall be addressed by the CPAC issuing the TO against the Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).

<DESC>Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b) for commercial items, the United States Army Medical Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Vitrocell Systems GmbH, Fabrik Sonntag 3, 79183 Waldkrich, Germany. Vitrocell Systems GmbH has been identified as the responsible source that can fulfill this particular requirement. USAMRAA will issue a firm-fixed price contract award for this requirement; NAICS 334516/500; value US$67,467.60. <br>  <br> This is a logical follow-on procurement for equipment. The US Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD) has been using the smaller VITROCELL 12/3 titanium exposure module for over three years. The VITROCELL 12/12 module is compatible with existing VITROCELL software, hardware and expertise of researchers in-house. These are required for the continuity and reproducibility of data. Changing the equipment and software would nullify previous research conducted, its historical data, compromise the quality of the data and also significantly impact the ability to reach critical milestones. Competing this requirement is not in the best interest of the Government since substantial duplication of costs to the Government will be incurred. This cost is not expected to be recovered through competition. <br>  <br> Any responses to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities, pricing and other information which demonstrates the ability to meet the Government's need. This information must be received no later than (NLT) 27 NOV 2013 at 1000 hrs EST. <br>  <br> A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Detailed capabilities may be emailed (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments, no ZIP files) to, Jacklyn McGurk, email: sjacklyn.r.mcgurk.civ@mail.mil. No telephone calls will be accepted.  <br> Statements are due NLT 1000hrs, EST, on 27 NOV 2013. <br>  <br>

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. &lt;p&gt; This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ)] for FLIGHT SERVICES FOR DESCENT AND LANDING TESTBED VEHICLES. &lt;p&gt; NASA/ARC has a requirement for the acquisition of commercial flight services to fly technology payloads on propulsively controlled vertical landing rockets that accommodate both open-loop flight and closed-loop flight with the payload in the guidance, navigation, and control loop of the vehicle.  The NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) Flight Opportunities Program (hereafter the Program) works towards maturing the flight readiness of crosscutting technologies that advance multiple future space missions.  The Program acquires commercial flight and payload integration services to fly technology payloads on missions to help achieve the goals of the STMD.  A specific component of this effort is the testing of innovative technologies that require flight on propulsively controlled vertical landing rockets, including closed-loop flight with the payload in the guidance, navigation, and control loop of the vehicle.  This requirement was not initially anticipated by the Program but has subsequently received interest for testing technologies for use during the entry, decent, and landing phase of a space mission and other applications.  To meet the objectives for testing these technologies, the Program intends to acquire flight services on vehicles that mimic the relevant environment needed for these new testing requirements.	The relevant environment specifically sought in this solicitation is flight on board, and in control of, a propulsively controlled rocket during hovering, cross range and down range translation, and vertical landing maneuvers. &lt;p&gt; NASA ARC anticipates award of one or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) commercial contracts in accordance with FAR 16.504 and 12.207(c)(1)  under which firm fixed price task orders for flight services will be issued.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (End of Clause) Alternate I (Aug 2012) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause.

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5) (i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may?

(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to-- (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor?s managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.

(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor?

It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.

When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5) (i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may?

Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract.

(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor?

It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation.

<DESC>Your professional services are requested as a Counselor for the U. S. Department of State's Career Transition&nbsp;Center (CTC) Job Search Program (JSP).
<p>The George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center of the Department of State is the federal government's primary training facility for personnel of the foreign affairs community. The Foreign Service Institute (FSI) is the Department bureau that provides training for employees of the Department of State and&nbsp;other agencies at the Shultz Center. The Career Transition Center offers three major programs to help employees plan for the future and prepare for retirement: The Mid-Career Retirement Planning Seminar (MCRPS), the Retirement Planning Seminar (RPS) and the Job Search Program (JSP).&nbsp;<br /><br />The professional services of a Counselor are needed to help with the transition of the JSP participants from&nbsp;widely varied areas of the Foreign Service and Civil Service in the Department of State and other Foreign&nbsp;Affairs agencies, and include employees who are being voluntarily and involuntarily separated from service&nbsp;with the government. Each participant is beginning a transition to a new life outside the institutional structure they have known. They vary in expertise, rank, race, gender and age, with most being in the range from late-40s to late-60s. Their post-retirement plans are diverse, and their geographic targets include overseas as well as US locations. Some are seeking employment in the private sector; others are interested in not-for-profit&nbsp;organizations or related areas of government service, or educational sectors, and/or part-time or volunteer&nbsp;employment. Some are uncertain of their next steps, and are using the JSP to help them formulate their plans for&nbsp;the future.</p>
<p>The Job Search Program helps employees clarify career goals, assess interests, skills, and values, prepare a&nbsp;resume, build a network of people who can help in finding a job, sharpen interviewing skills, and negotiate&nbsp;salary and benefits. JSP class sizes range from 55 to over 120. The program is offered three times each year,&nbsp;generally in March, August and October.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies.

If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK PROPOSED: <br /><br /></strong>The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKB) at Lackland AFB, TX, has been asked to provide engineering, restoration and construction services to achieve Site Closeout (SC) through remedial action at Scott AFB, Illinois. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the corresponding Statement of Objective (SOO), dated 4 September 2013. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, IL for approximately 29 sites. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). Reference the latest SOO dated 4 September 2013 and attachments posted to FEBBIZOPPS for the latest documents. <br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: <br /><br /></strong>The 772 ESS/PKB intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, Illinois. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a firm-fixed price (FFP) pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. This requirement is being issued as a Small Business Set-Aside.<br /><br />NOTE: You are hereby notified that the project owner has certified this project as a valid requirement. Firms will NOT be reimbursed for bid and proposal costs incurred. Therefore, if your firm elects to participate in the proposal process for this requirement and the projects are not funded, you shall not be entitled to submit any claim for bid and/or proposal costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.<br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the third quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's ROM for this PBR is anticipated to be between $30,000,000 and $37,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Daniel Cevallos, Jr. Email correspondence shall be sent to Mr. Cevallos with a copy to the contract specialists, Ms. Laura Stewart and Ms. Rebecca Robinson. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements</span>: Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmental Insurance (EI)</span>: The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonding Capacity</span>: The Air Force is currently proposing to require performance and payment bonds for only the construction portion of this PBR. The bonding required for the construction portion of this effort is anticipated to be 52% of the total estimated contract amount if all options are exercised. An estimated bonding stream is provided to show estimated bonding amounts per year. Note: Bonding may differ from the estimated bonding stream provided based on the proposed technical approach. (Reference Presolicitation FA8903-13-R-0040 RFI documents.)<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)</span>: An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Scott AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br />Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

Will the plate carries be custom, or semi-custom, to work with the kit?<br /><br />A:&nbsp;The users desires the ability to adapt the OCS system to whichever vest or assault style pack they already have. Accessory MOLLE pouches or any type of MOLLE bag that carries the OCS and can be installed or customized by the user are acceptable options. The Government is looking for a system that does not require customization for particular plate carriers.

During the first phase of this evaluation process, all offerors' Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) and proposed prices will be evaluated. Those offerors who have submitted PDMs that are most highly rated and who have submitted price proposals that are realistic and competitive with other offerors who have submitted most highly rated PDMs will then be evaluated in the second phase of this evaluation process for the remaining technical evaluation factors</p>
<p>All materials used in the fabrication of the end item are to be furnished by the contractor with the exception of the basic fabric which will be provided as Government Furnish Material (GFM). The Government does not intend to use FAR part 12 for this acquisition. Reference Numbered Notes 1, 9, and 26.</p>

<p>Important Note on Foreign content<br />The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statues (including what is commonly referred to as "The Berry Amendment") impose restrictions on the DoD's acquisition of foreign products and services. Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and "specialty metals" (as defined in DFARS clause 252.25.7014), including the materials and components thereof (other than sensors, electronics, or other items added to, and not normally associated with clothing), must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.</p>
<p>CAUTION NOTICE -- TWO-PHASE TECHNICAL/PRICE EVALUATION <br />(AUG 2007) DSCP<br />The Government anticipates that numerous offerors will submit proposals on solicitation. In the event that eight or more proposals are received, the Government may use a two-phase evaluation process, which allows the Contracting Officer to conduct a preliminary evaluation of all offers, in order to determine which offers are the least likely to be candidates for further consideration. During this preliminary evaluation, all offerors' Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) and proposed prices will be evaluated. Certain offerors may be excluded from further consideration at this point, if their PDM ratings and/or offered prices are not competitive when compared with PDM ratings and prices proposed by other offerors. The remaining offers will then be evaluated for the remaining technical evaluation factors. After the completion of this review, the Contracting Officer will determine whether to establish a competitive range and enter into negotiations, or to award without discussions. This process is set forth in provision 52.215-9P23, Two-Phase Technical/Price Evaluation contained in solicitation.</p>

The purpose of this RFI is two-fold:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Obtain written responses to the attached Market Research Questionnaire due <strong>11/15/13</strong>. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Invite industry to attend an Industry Day <strong>11/18/13</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>MARKET RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRE&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>&nbsp; Consistent with FAR Part 10, Market Research, GSA is conducting market research to determine if it should acquire alternative transportation services and how best to do so. GSA is interested in being able to provide its customers a variety of transportation solutions designed to fit a customer&rsquo;s vehicle needs. For example, for customers that only need transportation intermittently, it may be more cost beneficial to use a car sharing service in lieu of renting, leasing and/or purchasing a vehicle. To that end, GSA asks that interested parties <strong><em>complete the attached questionnaire no later than 4:30PM, November 15, 2013</em></strong> and return it to Patricia Hoffman at Patricia.Hoffman@gsa.gov and onthego@gsa.gov. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Invitation to Attend Industry Day <br /></strong><br />&nbsp; The Travel, Motor Vehicle and Card Services (TMVCS) Portfolio is pursuing an array of car sharing initiatives to help federal agencies reduce costs, improve service and optimize their use of vehicles. TMVCS has monitored industry developments for car sharing services and the increasing number of vendors and locations available at this time lend itself to a government-wide pilot program to determine how best to take advantage of alternative transportation services. TMVCS&rsquo; goal in this effort is to drive agency cost savings while simultaneously allowing the agency to focus resources on their mission instead of on the ancillary services that GSA can provide more efficiently.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;TMVCS may issue a pilot BPA where it will use the vendors currently on Schedule 48 Special Item Number (SIN) 411-2 to conduct a pilot in four metropolitan cities (New York City, Washington DC, Boston and Chicago) and to meet immediate agency needs. Vendors must be on schedule to be able to participate in the initial BPA, but TMVCS anticipates adding vendors to the BPA throughout its life cycle. Therefore, concurrent to any potential government-wide pilot BPA effort, TMVCS wants to expand the number of car sharing service providers and additional cities serviced. To accomplish this, TMVCS will hold an industry day on <strong><em>Monday, November 18, 2013 from 1pm to 4pm Eastern Time at the GSA Central Office located at: <br /></em></strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> 1800 F Street NW&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Washington DC 20405<br /><br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The dual purpose of this industry day is to obtain additional suppliers and information as well as educate new car sharing vendors how to participate on Schedule 48. <strong><em>Please RSVP not later than COB Friday, November 8, 2013</em></strong> by replying to Patricia Hoffman at Patricia.Hoffman@gsa.gov and onthego@gsa.gov in order to provide the security desk a list of attendees. Plan on arriving 15 minutes early to clear security. TMVCS will confirm your reservation via email with the room number. Follow up vendor appointments will be available after the industry day has concluded as requested. In your RSVP request, please note whether you are interested in a follow up vendor appointment (via phone or in person) and identify dates and times that work best. The vendor appointment will be an opportunity to provide talk to the Government regarding your firm&rsquo;s capability to perform car sharing services.

<DESC><strong>THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID. NO PROJECT PLANS OR SPECIFICATIONS ARE AVAILABLE. THIS PROJECT IS TENTATIVELY SET TO BE ADVERTISED ON NOVEMBER 18, 2013 WITH A TENTATIVE BID OPENING DATE OF&nbsp;DECEMBER 17, 2013.</strong><br /><br />The Mooney Road project is located in Plumas County and in Lassen County on California Forest Highway (FH) 117 near Westwood, California. The project will provide resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation to 7.1 miles of roadway from approximate 1500 feet south of Swain Mountain Road to the intersection with California SR-44. Work will be suspended for approximately 3100 feet within the project limits from Station 723+43 to Station 754+10 for a realignment project to be designed and constructed under the authority of Lassen County.<br /><br />The major work elements include cold in-place recycle of the existing pavement to a depth of 3 &frac12; inches, subexcavation, asphalt surfacing of 3 inches, guardrail removal and installation, and selective tree thinning. Due to the elevation of the project, snow melt typically occurs in late Spring, and snow falls in late Fall, thus controlling commencement and termination of construction operations. All work is expected to take place between April, 2014 and early November, 2014. Temperature dependent work items such as cold in-place recycle, asphalt paving, and pavement marking must be completed in dry conditions, for which seasonal conditions are limited.<br /><br />The estimated cost of the proposed project is between $5 Million and $8 Million. <br /><br />Significant quantities include:<br /><br />Line Item Unit Estimated Quantity<br />Subexcavation CY 280<br />Selective Clearing SY 7,500<br />Roadway Aggregate TON 6,600<br />Hot Asphalt Conc. Pavem't TON 22,000<br />Cold Recycled Asphalt Base SY 129,000<br />Guardrail LF 1,375

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY DAY  <br>  MELVIN PRICE/WOOD RIVER SEEPAGE CUT-OFF WALL PROJECT  <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, St. Louis District will host a Construction Industry Day event on Tuesday, December 3, 2013 for all businesses interested in the Melvin Price/Wood River Seepage Cut-Off Wall Project.  <br>    <br>  The Melvin Price/Wood River Seepage Cut-Off Wall Project Construction Industry Day event will be held at the National Great Rivers Museum, #2 Locks and Dam Way, Alton, IL 62002.  The event is free of charge and all interested parties are invited to attend.   <br>    <br>  To register, please return Registration Form (Attachment-A) by email to:  <br> Barrietta.Killiebrew@usace.army.mil no later than November 26, 2013. Pre-registration is required due to potential space limitations. Attendance is limited to four (4) representatives per company.   <br>    <br>    <br>  CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY DAY - December 3, 2013 - Time: 8 a.m. to 12 p.m.  <br> The Construction Industry Day event provides an opportunity to learn about this significant project and assist in the improvement of the Plans and Specifications.  This event provides contractors and suppliers the opportunity to take a critical look at how the project features are proposed to be laid out and allows for feedback that could result in a reduction in cost, improve constructability, reduce schedule risk, and provide firsthand experience on best practice methods. The proposed Melvin Price/Wood River Seepage Cut-Off Wall Project will involve the construction of an 8,100 lineal feet seepage cut-off wall to approximate depths of 135 to 165 feet.  The project is located adjacent to and upstream of the Melvin Price Locks and Dam in Alton, IL and will address underseepage occurring along this Wood River Levee reach.  The Construction Industry Day will include a general overview of the underseepage problem as well as the government's proposed solution to the underseepage.  Architectural renderings for conceptual project design features, such as: proposed cut-off wall alignment, subsurface conditions, design concepts, and hydrographs will be provided before the Construction Industry Day on the following link located below in the Government Agency URL:  http://www.mvs.usace.army.mil/Missions/ProgramsProjectManagement/idmp.aspx. Hardcopies will be available at the meeting.  Read ahead material will be posted by November 22, 2013.  The event will also include a question and answer workshop and one-on-one private sessions with a Government team.  To ensure a thorough understanding of the project, contractors are encouraged to view the project site prior to or the day of the event. The project site is in close proximity to the Industry Day location.   <br>    <br>  Constructability Questions to Industry: The Government is seeking industry feedback on the project information and additional questions which will be provided on the previously mentioned website by November 22, 2013.  <br>    <br>  All interested parties, regardless of event attendance, are encouraged to voluntarily submit written responses, constructive input, or additional questions. Responses may be submitted prior to, during or after the event. Please send advance responses to Barrietta.Killiebrew@usace.army.mil. Responses are intended to initiate discussion during a facilitated, group question and answer session.    <br>    <br>  One-on-one Sessions: Please indicate on the Registration Form if you would like to sign up for a one-on-one session.  Please be prepared to discuss the questions below, which will be used to guide the discussions.  These questions may be modified.  Any modifications will be posted on the previously mentioned website prior to the event.     <br>    <br>    <br>  1.	It is anticipated that funding constraints will lead to construction of the cut-off wall in phases. Is there a minimum (or maximum) length of wall we should place in a single solicitation to avoid unnecessary efficiency losses?  If so what are those limits?  Should anything else (other than cut-off wall length) be considered for the contract package?     <br>    <br>  2.	Considering cost efficiency - What is the optimum contract value needed to ensure sufficient competitive bids from qualified contractors in this industry?  <br>    <br>  3.	What issues do you anticipate going through the cobble and boulder zones in the aquifer?  Drilling mud loss has been encountered in the cobble and boulder zones.  How would your firm mitigate this risk?  How should the government's specifications address cobbles and boulders to best mitigate risk and reduce contingencies in bids?  <br>    <br>  4.	Are there any work platform or layout requirements not accounted for by government in the typical cross sections provided?  Is the government including work area accommodations that are unnecessary?  <br>    <br>  5.	It is anticipated the cut-off wall will bisect at least two active pipelines.  We are considering use of jet grouting in these to cut-off the underseepage.  What concerns should we consider when specifying this method?  Are there other methods we should consider specifying for seepage cutoff in the area of these pipeline crossings?  <br>    <br>  6.	It is anticipated that the cut-off wall will run in parallel with three utilities (one gas line and two telecommunication lines).  Care must be taken in design not to damage the existing utilities.  What range of equipment loadings should our design account for in these areas?  Are there specific methods for dealing with parallel utilities that we should consider?  <br>    <br>  7.	Do you anticipate any additional problems for your operation not discussed in the preceding questions with respect to design, production, and safety/stability?  <br>    <br>  8.	What other feedback would you like to provide for consideration to improve the constructability of this project?  <br>  <br>    <br>  Capability Statements: Interested parties, regardless of event attendance, are invited to submit capability statements for market research purposes and acquisition strategy planning (5-page limit). A recommended outline at Attachment-B.  Please submit capability statements to Corps Contracting Division Representatives at the event, or mail to: Contracting Division, Attn: Barrietta Killiebrew, USACE - St. Louis, 1222 Spruce Street, St. Louis, MO 63103-2833.  <br>    <br>    <br>  This notice does not constitute a solicitation. This announcement and the Construction Industry Day event are for planning purposes only. The acquisition strategy for this proposed project has not yet been developed.  Response to this notice is strictly voluntary. The Government will not reimburse any party attending or participating for costs incurred for this event or marketing efforts.  <br>    <br>  DISCLOSURE NOTIFICATION AND PROCEDURES  <br>    <br>  Please do not submit proprietary information.  Any information provided may be incorporated into the design of the project. Information submitted in response to this notice is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge or provide feedback with respect to any information submitted under this notice.  <br>    <br>  - Prior to the Industry Day on December 3, 2013: The Government may post clarifications, questions, and comments submitted in response to this notice on the Federal Business Opportunities website without identification of the source.  Electronic responses to the expanded list of questions will not be published.   <br>    <br>  - Industry Day Session:  The responses from the public questions and answers session will be transcribed and the transcript will be posted to the website following the event.    <br>    <br>  - One on One Sessions: The government will not reveal or post information discussed during the one-on-one sessions.  To ensure bid fairness, the government will not reveal or post proprietary data, company identification and trade secrets.   <br>

<DESC>The scope of this requirement is for the advance development for an Electric Propulsion (EP)System, which is recognized as an efficient means of providing thrust to spacecraft.  Recent technical advances have made EP systems a common mode for orbit maintenance and spacecraft attitude control for larger spacecraft.  Successes in orbit-raising have encouraged NASA mission designers to consider high power Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) technology mature enough to design long distance human exploration missions predicated on its use.  While these technology developments have been occurring at the macro scale thruster level, advances have also been made with thruster technology on a much smaller scale.  It is envisioned that EP based micro-thrusters can be used for small satellite propulsion, as well as fine attitude control for large satellites that require extreme pointing control such as space telescopes.  One class of micro-thrusters, electrospray micro thrusters, seems particularly promising in meeting the needs for both small spacecraft propulsion and fine attitude control of large spacecraft.  Furthermore, scaled up versions of electrospray micro-thrusters may one day be able to provide thrust equivalent to the Hall and Ion EP technologies now in use. Fully developed, electrospray micro-thruster technologies have the potential to result in a complete re-design of the power and propulsion requirements for a SEP class mission.  The need for these micro thruster technologies has been captured within the relevant NASA Space Technology Roadmap (TA-02: In-Space Propulsion Technologies) and general EP technologies were called out in the recent National Research Council recommendations to NASA.

To satisfy USDA mission requirements, the facility must be within a reasonable distance of the major US and State Highways. The office is currently located in an area that maximizes the three Agencies ability to serve both the local and rural customers. The location affords valuable resources to Dillon, Florence, Horry, Marion, Marlboro, Chesterfield, Darlington, Kershaw and Lee Counties. In order to provide a one stop shop experience the three agencies signed a collocation agreement that requires an exception to policy approval at the national level to de-collocate. As a part of the transformation, the information technology Structure of the three offices are also designed to be interdependent which includes the computer network environment and the telephone system to further streamline the process and provide a one stop shop. The cost of rewiring and reconfiguring the information technology system would cost approximately $90,000 for all three offices. </span></p>

The three Agencies have aligned operations to act as a &ldquo;one Stop Shop&rdquo; to service the customer base of Florence and surrounding counties. The information technology infrastructure of the three agencies have been interconnected and controlled by a common server along with telephone services. The OCIO/IT requirements are unique to the USDA Service Center. According to USDA to duplicate the wire setup for one agency would be approximately $30,000 which would equate to $90,000 estimate to duplicate the current alignment at a new location. It is also vital for all three agencies to be collocated since they use the same telephone service and computer system and has a collocation agreement in place.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The cost of relocating USDA-RD, USDA-FSA, and USDA-NRCS using the low cost quote exceeds the cost of remaining at 215 3</span><sup>rd</sup><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"> Loop Rd. Florence, SC. The savings to the Government is $446,688.17. Based on this cost-benefit analysis, the Government cannot expect to recover relocation and duplication costs through competition.

The research conducted has shown this rate to be higher than the current market rate, thus to exercise the 10 year option is not in the best interest of the Government. The savings to the Government not to exercise the option and negotiate a succeeding lease with the incumbent lessor would be $656,734.40.</span></p>

<DESC>The knowledge required to conduct the aforementioned evaluation and other tasks is specialized and concerns areas of forensic document examination and handwriting analysis expertise that is well beyond the scope of Defense Counsel's understanding. In this case, only one contractor is capable of meeting the unique skill set required to defend the accused. Market research supports other than full and open competition (sole source) for this requirement. Due to the highly specialized area of expertise and the sensitive nature of a Courts-Martial Trial, a limited amount of individuals are capable of providing the anticipated service. Based on the market research and guidance from the USARAK Legal Team, the vendor is the most qualified and capable source to provide this service. Her handwriting analysis expertise and knowledge of forensic document examination make her the only source capable of providing the accused a proper defense in this Courts-Martial Trial. IAW FAR 6.302-3, Full and open competition need not to be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to acquire the services of an expert or neutral person for any current or anticipated litigation or dispute. Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by the written justification and approval described in FAR 6.303 and FAR 6.304.

<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposals are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
