<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH), Spokane Research Laboratory (SRL) has a requirement for a contractor to Develop Training Materials and Teach Two Classes on Risk Management for U.S. Mining Industry, as well as Develop Training Materials & Teach Two Class for Facilitator Training in the United States.

The specific project need is to transfer the theory and practice of Major Hazard Risk Management, as successfully practiced in Australian mines, to the US mining industry through workshops directed to mine managers, labor leaders mine site facilitators.  

NIOSH has an ongoing pilot project to evaluate the potential for Risk Assessment and Management in the US through interactive risk assessment at several mining company properties and through the evaluation of a mine selected risk topic.  One of the purposes is to evaluate the distinctive management and operational character of the US mining industry.   

Although initially focused on the recent mine disasters, it is evident from the ongoing NIOSH study that risk based safety management systems have a broader positive impact on safety but training and exposure of mine personnel to risk management and risk assessment are both critical and extremely important.   One of the findings of NIOSH personnel working with US companies showed; the that the lack of experience of working with risk management or the lack of experience of working in a large company in a foreign setting where risk management was conducted;  the US mining industry must be trained in risk management and risk assessment tools.

In order to continue the work started under the NIOSH pilot project for US risk management assessment, NIOSH will continue the work to educate the US mining industry.  The overall industry needs training in order to better understand risk management and risk assessment. Therefore, NIOSH will hold a series of training workshops open to the US mining industry to outline specifically what risk assessment and risk management actually means within the mining culture and second gather the broadest management and labour representation horizontally and vertically for the training in order to have the highest and most efficient impact.  The time frame for the workshops is approximately 15 months with training sites selected at different US geographical locations which are close to various US mining commodities.  The purpose is to build understanding for the wider use of the Risk Assessment and Management process and to maximize the highest positive impact across the entire US mining industry. 

1.	Develop a NIOSH training module, ?Overview of Risk Management and Risk Assessment?

2.	Develop a NIOSH training module ?Facilitator Training for Risk Assessment and Risk Management?

3.	The expert will teach the facilitator training at NIOSH sponsored training venues in various US geographical locations. 

Reports on case studies and review of NIOSH reports are due within six weeks of completion of the case study or transmittal of the report for review, with an estimated time of project completion 12/22/2007.

Coal mining in Australia has traditionally been subjected to industry specific prescriptive laws and regulation similar to the United States.  In response to mine disasters in Australia in the 1990?s, several state governments mandated risk management and hazard management planning to eliminate mine disasters in Australia.  The states of Queensland, Western Australia and New South Wales, where major mining occurs have been at the fore front of mineral industry risk management internationally.  There have been dramatic changes in how mines approach risk in Australia with major reductions in disaster potential and fatalities resulting.  

The professionals who are trained in risk management with an intimate knowledge of mining are people who have worked and practiced this field in Australia.  One of those persons is Simon Destree-Thompson. Mr. Destree-Thompson has worked in risk management applied to mining since its inception in Australia in 1994.  Mr. Destree-Thompson has represented the Australian government at international safety councils, has been Chief Inspector of Metalliferrous Mines for the Queensland Department of Minerals and Energy  and worked with companies such as BHP WMC and Rio Tinto. Mr. Destree-Thompson has moved to Houston Texas, making his unique experience readily available for transfer to the US mining industry.

Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in any form they choose.  Please forward capabilities statement to Denise L. Rains, 315 East Montgomery Avenue, Spokane, WA 99207, phone (509)354-8111, fax (509)354-8099, or email dgr8@cdc.gov.   

The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and supporting information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide the requirement.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Simon Thompson Associates, Houston, TX, as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of any Federal Contract.  Vendors may register @ www.ccr.gov.

<CONTACT>JEFF CARAVELLI CONTRACTING OFFICER 9162789341     jcaravelli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has been involved with aquifer monitoring at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) since the early 1950s.  Hundreds of monitoring wells have been drilled on and around the INL to examine the fate and transport of contaminants and to characterize the regional aquifer system.  In collaboration with the INL, the USGS has started a new phase in aquifer monitoring that includes the use of deep (up to 1,400 feet) vertical monitoring systems that allow for the collection of pressure, temperature, and water quality data at specific depths within a single borehole.  Using a series of inflatable packers to seal the open-borehole, data can be collected and analyzed that will add 3-dimensional control for ongoing numerical modeling.  Results will be used to verify where contaminants are moving as they disperse through the aquifer. Open boreholes do not allow for measurement of vertical variation in pressure, temperature, or water quality.  Mixing of water chemistry and pressure occurs inside of open boreholes and can change or dilute the pressure or water chemistry.  To better characterize the shallow, intermediate, and deep aquifer system of the eastern Snake River Plain, a vertical monitoring system is needed that meets borehole diameter limitations (3.5 to 4.8 inch) and that can monitor at depths 1,400 feet or greater where the water table can exceed 600 feet.   To meet this need, the USGS intends to contract with Westbay Water Services (a subsidiary of Schlumberger) for two (2) MP55 multi-level monitoring systems and technical services relating to installation thereof at USGS wells 103 and 133 on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1) and the procedures of FAR Part 12, entitled "Acquisition of Commercial Items."  The USGS has an existing inventory of Westbay components and has already invested significant dollars in training and ancillary support for that equipment.  Further, the USGS is not aware of any other manufacturer currently making equipment that is capable of meeting our need at the required depth and in the small-diameter borehole that we are using.       Other interested concerns having the ability to meet the USGS' requirement may submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement at 17:00 local time.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  If no competitive opportunities exist, request for quotation (RFQ) 07WRQQ0061 will be made available to Westbay through the Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE) on or about 12 June 2007, IAW FAR 5.102(a)(1). This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-16, effective 22 March 2007 For further information, please contact the Contracting Officer at (916) 278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov.

<DESC>Project Objectives
The procedures of the study, including the intervention, will be designed by CDC and HRSA with collaborative input from the contractors.  The objective of this contract is for contractors to conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine an intervention to increase retention of HIV+ patients in primary medical care.  Contractors will implement and oversee the trial, assure its quality, and supply CDC and HRSA with relevant outcome data described below. We anticipate that the intervention will increase HIV patient retention at least 30% relative to the rates before the intervention.  If found to be efficacious, the government will be able to disseminate this intervention to HIV primary care clinics throughout the United States.   
 Scope of Work
•	The intervention will be implemented and tested for efficacy at six HIV primary care clinics.  Clinic attendance (from clinic records) is the primary outcome variable.  Three clinics (Panel A clinics) will be randomly selected to implement the intervention immediately after baseline clinic data are tabulated and a cohort of patients enrolled and surveyed at each of the six sites; the other three clinics (Panel B clinics) will delay implementation of the intervention for approximately 12 months and will serve as a control group for evaluating the efficacy of the intervention as delivered by Panel A clinics during the prior year.  The first follow-up tabulation of attendance will occur at each clinic after this 12-month intervention period.  Panel B clinics will then implement the intervention for 12 months (and Panel A clinics will continue implementing the intervention). Follow-up tabulation of attendance will be made at each of the six clinics.
Basic design of the study is shown below

  Technical Requirements
    Project Tasks and Activities
The following are the specific tasks, activities and personnel requirements by phase of the project:

1.  PHASE 1--PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT (Date of Award through 12 months thereafter).   Unless otherwise specified all activities pertain to both Panel A and B clinics.  
Task 1.1 Investigators Meetings.   Attend a two-day investigators meeting at CDC in Atlanta to establish contractor and CDC roles, contractor and CDC responsibilities and study timelines. 
Task 1.2  Protocol Development  The contractor shall participate in bi-weekly telephone conference calls with CDC and the other contractors to prepare the study protocol including the design of the intervention, development of survey instrument, clinic-level variables and a consent form for participants who will complete the survey.
Task 1.3  Feedback and Written Revisions.  CDC will provide a draft protocol.  The contractor shall prepare written comments and revisions to be placed  inside a Microsoft Word formatted  draft protocol and survey questionnaires.  The protocol will be circulated by CDC to the contractors several times during Phase 1.  The protocol will include all the intervention procedures.
Task 1.4  Program Review Panel.  The contractor shall submit a signed copy of the Program Review Panel document (CDC form 0.1113, To be provided in the Solicitation) attesting to the Panel’s review of educational pamphlets, fact sheets and intervention materials.
Task 1.5 OMB Package.  The CDC will provide a draft of the OMB documents.  The contractor shall provide written comments and suggestions (inside a Microsoft Word document) concerning CDC’s OMB packet
Task 1.6   Make Improvements to Attendance Tracking System.  The contractor shall make improvements necessary to their site’s attendance tracking capability.  If site does not have a reliable electronic attendance tracking capability (as determined by CDC), they must purchase new software to permit reliable tracking (into the future) of all patients’ attendance at primary medical care visits.
Task 1.7  Create Attendance Database.  The contractor shall create a clinic-wide database on attendance using clinic records. The database shall track forward in time all clinic patients’ attendance at primary medical care visits, using patient identifiers.  
Task 1.8 Data Manager Training.  The contractor shall participate in a two-day data manager training at CDC, during the first 12 months of project.  This training will supply to the contractors the format and software for medical record abstraction, and clinic attendance data submissions.  Quality control procedures, (e.g., double checking of data values) will be included in the training.
Task 1.9  Local IRB Submission and Approval.  The contractor shall submit the CDC-approved protocol for local-site IRB approval.  Following approval, contractor shall deliver to CDC the IRB approval letter and a copy of the IRB-approved consent form with approval and date indicated. .
Task 1.10  Patient Contact Instruments.  The contractor shall develop instruments that capture Case Manager and Outreach worker documentation of patient contacts. These instruments will produce the data that will document the consistency with which the intervention is delivered across time. The minimum format will be specified at the Data Manager Training (Task 1.8)..
Task 1.11  Quarterly Reports.  Submit quarterly progress reports to CDC. The minimum content of the quarterly reports shall be: project personnel in place (by name) during the quarter; changes in personnel or major duties that occurred during the quarter; data collected and submitted by type and shipment date; number of subjects screened; number of subjects enrolled; number of medical chart abstractions. 

ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT FOR PHASE 1
Based on 2080 hours per year.
Principal Investigator:   416 hours
Study Coordinator:  624 hours
Data Manager/Analyst:  624 hours


2.  PHASE 2—PRE-OMB APPROVAL:  (12 months from date of award through 24 months from date of award).  Unless otherwise specified all activities pertain to both Panel A and B clinics.  We anticipate that there will be minimal activities in Phase 2 because we will be waiting for OMB approval.  Staffing should reflect the reduced workload.
Task 2.1 Investigators Meetings: The contractor shall attend a two-day investigators meeting at CDC to refine intervention responsiblities of clinic staff, refine the intervention timeline, plan for the intervention training, and participate in bi-weekly conference calls during the year.
Task 2.2  Study Collaboration and Manual:  The contractor shall continue to work towards  preparing to put study in the field.  Contractor shall prepare sections of the intervention training manual that are to be used by study staff members and providers in his clinic. The manual shall include how clinic patients are being approached and recruited into the measurement cohort; the plans for delivering the intervention and oversight of the intervention; and plans for submitting data. 
Task 2.3  Attendance Database:  The contractor shall make quarterly transmissions to CDC in Atlanta of the clinic-wide database on patient attendance. See Task 1.7 for database requirements.
Task 2.4 Quarterly Reports:  The contractor shall submit quarterly progress reports to CDC.  See task 1.11 for required content.

ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT FOR PHASE 2
Principal Investigator:   416 hours
Study Coordinator:  624 hours
Data Manager/Analyst:  624 hours


3.  PHASE 3—COHORT ENROLLMENT AND INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTATATION  (24 months from date of award through 36 months from date of award).  Unless otherwise specified all activities pertain to both Panel A and B clinics.

After contract award, CDC will determine which clinics will be randomly assigned to implement the intervention immediately (Panel A clinics) and which will delay implementation for approximately one year (Panel B clinics).  Phase 3 therefore is presented in 2 options, and the offerors’ proposal must include both options.  

Option 3A—Panel A clinics will implement the intervention during Phase 3,and should therefore include appropriate staffing.
 Option 3B—Panel B clinics, the control group clinics, will enroll their cohort during phase 3  but will not implement the intervention during phase 3.  Requirements for study-specific case management and peer outreach should not be included. Appropriate staffing is to be included by Panel B clinics.

Task 3.1  Investigators Meeting:  The contractor shall attend a two-day investigators meeting at CDC to finalize intervention procedures, and revise timelines.   The contractor shall continue to participate in bi-weekly conference calls.
Task 3.2  Cohort Enrollment:  Identify and enroll a cohort of at least 250 patients during a 4 to 6-month period from the clinic-wide data base.  This cohort should include sufficient numbers of patients who have attended clinic inconsistently.  Attempts should be made to enroll all new patients during the patient enrollment period. 
Task 3.3   Administer Questionnaires.  These are to be administered  to the minimum of 250 cohort members.
Task 3.4   Medical chart Abstraction .  Contractor shall perform medical chart abstractions of each cohort member, using the methodology given at the Data Manager Training at CDC (Phase 1).  The minimum content for the abstractions shall include CD4+ Tcell counts, HIV viral load, AIDS-defining conditions, and therapeutic regimens.   What is entailed in the Chart Review process?
Task 3.5   Quality Control .  Contractor shall perform quality control procedures of data collection. Quality control procedure will be specified in detail by CDC at the Data Manager Training (Phase 1, Task 1.8).
Task 3.6   Attendance Data:  The contractor shall tabulate patient clinic attendance before and after the intervention using clinic attendance records.  This shall include attendance data for the clinic-wide population as well as the cohort.  The format for that part of the attendance data to be transmitted to CDC will be specified at the Data Manager Training (Phase 1, Task 1.8).
Task 3.7   Transmitting Data.   Transmit attendance, medical chart data, survey (questionnaire) and patient contact data to the CDC over the secure data network.
Task 3.8  Intervention Training-Panel A.  The contractor’s clinic staff shall participate in a four-hour intervention training at the clinic site (Panel A clinics).  The intervention training is to be conducted by a separately funded training contractor, and will require clinic staff to participate in a series of adult learning activities (e.g., written exercises, role playing). 
Task 3.9  Identify Patients at Risk-Panel A.  Implement a method to identify patients at risk of falling out of medical care (Panel A clinics), using the methods in the finalized study protocol from Phase 1. 
Task 3.10  Begin Referrals-Panel A.  Refer patients at risk of falling out of care to a case manager and peer outreach worker as appropriate (Panel A clinics) within one week of screening for this risk.
Task 3.11   Begin Intervention delivery-Panel A.  Contractors shall begin delivering the intervention (Panel A clinics) according to the intervention content determined at the time the study protocol is finalized in Phase 1.
Task 3.12    Supervise Intervention Delivery-Panel A:  Supervise delivery of the intervention by medical providers, case manager and peer outreach personnel, and address problems or issues that arise (Panel A clinics). Problems and their solution shall be included in the quarterly reports.
Task 3.13   Quarterly Progress Reports.  Submit quarterly progress reports to the CDC.  See task 1.11 for required content.

The intervention will target those at risk of missing scheduled clinic appointments as determined by past clinic attendance records and other information.  The intervention will be given to those enrolled in the cohort as well as to other clinic patients deemed at risk of missing appointments.  The intervention will have multiple components including individual- and systems-level components such as:
&#61656;	messages given to patients by providers about the importance of staying in care.

<SUBJECT>F -- Threat Assessment and Pilot Surveillance Plan for the Papahanaumokuakea National Marine Monument
<SOLNBR>AB133C07RP0105A
<RESPDATE>071807

<DESC>NOAA?s Papahanaumokuakea National Marine Monument Office requires a contractor to provide all supervision, material and labor necessary to perform a comprehensive threat assessment and pilot surveillance project of the newly formed Monument area in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI).  Due to the size of the NWHI region, its remote location, and the multi-jurisdictional nature of management in the area, a threat assessment geared at the protection of the resources from the deep ocean to the land has not been conducted.  Characterizing and evaluating threats to the area coming from human activities such as illegal access, poaching, and unforeseen concerns arising from innovations in maritime technology will be an important part of this assessment.  Threats to the NWHI have been previously researched through the identification of a number of relevant data sets and an enforcement workshop geared at identifying solutions to remote enforcement issues in the area.  However, these have not been comprehensively evaluated or prioritized.  Therefore, the first task of this contract is to conduct a thorough threat assessment working with the co-trustee management agencies (NOAA, USFWS, and the State of Hawaii), the U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Defense, and relevant non-governmental entities.  This assessment will utilize to the extent necessary, public, commercial, classified and de-classified data to identify threats.  These threats should be prioritized by potential impact and probability of occurring, as well as geographically referenced.  The second task includes a review of the threat assessment with the management and enforcement agencies and an evaluation of existing assets for surveillance.  AIS, RadarSat imagery and sonar buoy arrays have been used by various agencies in the past, and potentially could be woven together for Monument management purposes in the future.  Identifying and evaluating these assets are important steps in creating an effective surveillance plan for the Monument.  Potential contractors shall have DOD security clearance that would allow them to evaluate the utility of military assets and data sets for surveillance purposes.  Many surveillance tools have been proposed for the Monument, including satellite surveillance, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), radar, AIS, SONAR arrays, etc.  However, they have not been evaluated against a comprehensive threat assessment, and compared by cost to benefit, and feasibility. This analysis will be used to develop a prioritized list of short, medium and long-term surveillance solutions for the Monument.  A small-scale pilot demonstration project will be selected from the prioritized list of solutions discussed above.  This project should demonstrate the capacity to conduct remote surveillance in the Monument, and should not be dependant upon the construction of significant infrastructure.

Scope of Work
1.	Convene and meet with a Monument core surveillance committee (MCSC) to identify relevant partners and establish key contacts
a.	Convene a Monument Core Surveillance Committee;
b.	Identify organizations at the federal, state, and local levels with significant stakeholder interests in ? and responsibilities for ? the study, management, and protection of the Monument and establish cooperative agreements where appropriate;
c.	Develop an understanding of the Monument management structure, existing enforcement and surveillance capacity, and regulations; and
d.	Develop a review process for documents and procedure for consultation.
2.	Conduct a Threat Assessment
a.	Evaluate and integrate all existing surveillance reports, workshop summaries, and previously identified data sets (private, public, classified, declassified and unclassified);
b.	Determine and define historical, present and future threats to the Monument;
c.	Assess the known threats to Monument resources using existing data sets;
d.	Evaluate existing surveillance capacity ? overflights, eyes on the water, human presence, VMS, listening stations, etc.;
e.	Prioritize threats geospatially, and if feasible divide the Monument into surveillance zones;
f.	Review threat assessment with MCSC; and 
g.	Write Threat Assessment Report (TAR).
3.	Surveillance Plans
a.	Evaluate the availability and utility of existing data for surveillance from public, commercial, government classified, unclassified and declassified data sets, existing sensors, acoustics, and remote sensing capacity;
b.	Evaluate existing technologies for surveillance (signal intelligence, acoustic, UAV, AUV, satellite imagery, terrestrial and marine based sensors, etc);
c.	Evaluate information required in order to carry out prosecution of illegal activities (i.e. is satellite data admissible in a court of law, or are hi-res images needed for prosecution?);
d.	Using TAR, develop prioritized short, medium, and long term surveillance strategies with cost/benefit and feasibility analysis;
1.	Each strategy, such as using AUV?s, or acoustic arrays should have a visual depiction of cost/benefit and feasibility and identification of point of diminishing returns
e.	Write short, medium and long-term surveillance plans (these plans should be written in such a way to accommodate a Spiral Development Process).
4.	Conduct Pilot Surveillance Project
a.	With MCSC develop a demonstration surveillance project

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: an ombudsman had been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.  The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsman, Mr. Michael R.

<DESC>17:  NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA). This announcement serves as notice that the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) Weapon System Integrator (WSI) Program Office, ESC, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731 intends to solicit and negotiate with Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems and Solutions (LMIS&S) in Colorado Springs, CO for the sustainment of the Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS) Force/Unit Level systems of record.  This effort will be executed by exercising Option CLIN 0014 under the AOC WSI contract (FA8706-06-D-0003).  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The notice signifies the Government's intent to issue a sole source contract, pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c)(1) to LMIS&S, Colorado Springs, CO.  A Request for Information (via Sources Sought Synopsis) was previously published on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site and the Hanscom AFB Electronic Request for Proposals Bulletin Board (HERBB) on 07 March 2007 for acquisition planning purposes.  The period of performance for this effort will be consistent with the period of performance remaining on the AOC WSI contract  at the date of the award of this effort.  Total estimated value of contract action will not exceed $75 Million.  TBMCS provides automated command and control, and decision support tools to plan, prepare for, and execute air campaigns during peacetime, exercises, war, humanitarian missions, and operation other than war.  TBMCS consists of over six-million lines of codes not available in the commercial or DoD sectors other than LMIS&S at the present time.  These six-million lines of code consist of approximately 1.25 million source lines of newly developed code and an additional 4.75 million lines of code associated with proprietary commercial off the shelf and other products integrated into TBMCS.  Contracted efforts will be limited to the sustainment of existing TBMCS fielded systems and will not involve any development of new capabilities. During the period of time covered by this contract, TBMCS will be fully integrated into the Air and Space Operations Center Weapon System (AOC WS).  Any sustainment of TBMCS components beyond the time frame envisioned by this contract action would be included under a new AOC WS contract action at that time.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or Request for Proposal (RFP).  This notice should not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will review any responses received within 15 days of this notice.  An Acquisition Ombudsman, Colonel Russell Blaine, Director, ESC Contracting, has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during proposal development.  You should only contact the Ombudsman with issues or problems you cannot satisfactorily resolve with the program manager and/or contracting officer.  The Ombudsman role is to hear concerns, issues, and recommendations and communicate these to the appropriate Government personnel. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired. The Ombudsman does not evaluate proposals or participate in source selection. You can contact the Ombudsman at (781) 377-2201.

<DESC>Point of Contact  Adam Butryn, 732-427-1008. Repair and Maintenance of AN/AVS-7(V) Family HUD Assemblies and Subassemblies. This is a market survey to locate potential sources of repair and maintenance for the AN/AVS-7(V) family HUD assemblies and s ubassemblies. The HUD enables helicopter pilots to use the Aviators Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) goggles during flight operations. The HUD provides critical operational information to the pilot superimposed over the ANVIS image.  The HUD minimizes the requirement for the pilot and co-pilot to look at the flight instruments, thus allowing them to concentrate on scanning outside of the cockpit. The government is seeking interested sources for the Repair and Maintenance of the AN/AVS-7(V) family of HUD systems. The government intends to purchase these services using an indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery (IDIQ) contract over a two-year period.  Respondents must have extensive knowledge of the ANVIS HUD system.   Potential offerors will be responsible for turning the nonfunctional components received from the government into ones which meet the most current operation form, fit and function as cal led out by applicable technical data within a repair cycle time of thirty (30) days. This effort also requires the maintenance of a parts inventory sufficient to support the aforementioned repair cycle time. Depot Maintenance Work Requirements (DMWRs) do n ot exist for this equipment. A complete technical data package was never procured and therefore is unavailable.  The Government will not provide any test equipment or facilities for this effort.Any interested sources must send the following information, NL T 15 June 07, to C-E LCMC IEW/S Directorate, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-IEW-N-II (Adam Butryn), Bldg. 1201, Ft.

The Government is seeking to identify additional sources with the capability to develop and implement a block upgrade program to mitigate future obsolescen ce impact and to extend the useful service life on the SINCGARS RT-1523A Receiver-Transmitter and related ancillaries. The RT-1523A Receiver/Transmitter was originally developed and manufactured by General Dynamics. Current sustainment spares Circuit Card Assemblies (CCA) are being produced by Tallahassee Technologies (Talla-Tech) Inc. The selected vendor will conduct a product evaluation and implement a block upgrade, to include redesign if necessary, to accomplish the above mentioned objectives. Productio n lead-time reduction, performance and reliability improvements are secondary objectives. During this product evaluation, the following criteria are to be used as a redesign guideline: a. Power, Size and Weight.  Evaluate each SINCGARS Circuit Card Assembl y (CCA) for improvements in power consumption, size and weight.b. Life Cycle. Use modern components to limit the need to continuously design out obsolete components over the life of the end item. c. Reliability. Improve reliability by reducing electrical stress on critical components on SINCGARS CCAs.d. Performance. Improve performance by utilizing integrated circuits with increased functionality, performance and component density in the areas of p rocessor capabilities, co-site performance, EMI, power consumption, acquisition time, blocked channel  detection, sensitivity, and inter-modulation.  e. Redesigned CCAs must meet all performance and environmental requirements of the original CCA and end item specifications. Product qualification tests, including interoperability and regression tests, will be conducted to validate the redesign efforts. A ll redesign impact on the AN/GRM-122 test set, for SINCGARS maintenance, must be addressed. The selected vendor will be required to update the RT-1523A Technical Data Package and all affected Technical Manuals. The expected time duration for implementing a ll elements of this redesign effort is 12 months from award of contract.f.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for services procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service, Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center located in Honolulu, Hawaii intends to acquire the following services: 1.) Maintenance, service and repair of government owned specialized marine instrumentation and equipment used for benthic habitat mapping, ecological monitoring, ecosystem investigations, oceanographic studies, and fisheries research.  Period of performance is one (1) base year from time of award with an option of two (2) years.  This is 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE - SEE NUMBERED NOTE 1.

Background: The NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center utilizes complex marine instrumentation and equipment which is deployed on ocean-going and near-shore vessels operating in the U.S. Pacific Islands and Atolls and their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). Specialized instrumentation and equipment are used for benthic habitat mapping, ecological monitoring, ecosystem investigations, oceanographic studies, and fisheries research. Servicing, maintenance, modification, and repair of such equipment is often required prior to, during, and immediately after research cruises, which last up to 70 days at sea and are conducted throughout the year. Although the types of instrumentation and equipment are known, the nature of the required servicing, repair, modifications, etc. cannot be determined at this time as it is dependant on the conditions and events that the gear are subject to during the cruise and also dependant on the needs/mission of particular cruises, some of which are not determined at this time.  Consequently, it is not possible at the time of establishing the contract to accurately estimate the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of certainty. This situation is common for the maintenance and servicing of complex marine equipment.

Quotations are being requested, and the entire solicitation is attached.  No Further solicitation will be issued.  All interested parties must respond to this announcement within (15) calendar days of this publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to (206)-527-7115 attention Mona Ash. ****The Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services? (DHHS) Indian Health Service (IHS), Division of Nursing, intends to negotiate with Medcom, Inc. on a sole sources basis, to provide IHS nursing staff with a broad range of online continuing education.  Additionally, there is a need to update several public health nursing courses IHS currently has and make those courses available online.  The basis for restricting competition is the authority of FAR 13.106(b) that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.  The anticipated contract period will be for one year.

The Government believes Medcom, Inc. is the only source available to meet its needs because no other commercial source has a product that can cover the broad spectrum of training courses needed, along with the ability to add and update the PHN courses, within the context of the other requirements.  Moreover, IHS is not aware of any other source that has the ability to offer the courses needed, except for the PHN courses, immediately.  The following constitute the key needs of this requirement.

The ability to pay for a broad array of courses via a user license.

The ability to provide needed data extracts on a regular basis in a useable electronic format.

Content shall be accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Ability to distribute courseware via the Internet.

Courses of various clinical subjects will train, test, and track continuing education (CE) for clinical staff via the Internet. 

Upon completion of course(s) and post-test(s) on the Internet, the course participant will receive immediate scoring and then may (print out) CE completion certificates. 

Online clinical courses will include text, graphics, and/or streaming video and include course selections from Nursing and other clinical continuing education in each of the following areas:

<DESC>This requirement was previously synopsized as N624020062088 (23 August 2006), as a service disabled veteran owned small business set-aside (SDVOSB).  The synopsis was subsequently cancelled by amendment dated 06 September 2006 due to a challenge by SBA as to whether the effort should be set-aside for the 8(a) program.  A sources sought synopsis was issued 14 September 2006 inviting interested 8(a) and SDVOSB firms to provide capability information.  Information received was evaluated by the PCO and forwarded to SBA.  As a result of this evaluation and review, the original decision to set the requirement aside for SDVOSB was confirmed.  Accordingly, the requirement is hereby resynopsised as follows.  The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Division intends to acquire Education and Training Services to support the Naval School Explosive Ordnance Disposal (NAVSCOLEOD), at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, following the procedures outlined in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  Services will include instruction of military and civilian personnel, related instructional support, curriculum maintenance, and curriculum development for course in the areas of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD).  It is intended that the resultant solicitation will be set-aside for exclusive participation by Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).  The resultant solicitation shall include a one-year base period of performance, and contain provisions for four (4) additional, consecutive, twelve (12) month option periods.  It is anticipated that a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract will be awarded as a result of the solicitation.  The closing date for receipt of proposals will be established in the Request For Proposals (RFP).  It is intended to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the solicitation.  The source selection will consider the offerors? technical proposal more important than the offerors? Price/Cost Proposal.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code and Small business size standard are 611699 and $6.5M, respectively.  Upon its release, the RFP will be made available electronically at www.neco.navy.mil.  All qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) are encouraged to submit proposals for consideration to the Government.  Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be considered for award.  See www.ccr.gov for further information and instructions.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate a contract modification to Contract HHSP23320054304EC with the Boston College Graduate School of Social Work, Boston College Office of Sponsored Programs, 140 Commonwealth Avenue, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467, on a sole source basis under the authority of  the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) to assist in funding technical assistance to and oversight/monitoring of states that have received separate  grant funding to implement Medicaid and/or Older Americans Act-funded program options based on the cash and counseling model of consumer-directed home and community-based services.  The modification will extend the current contract period through September 30, 2008.  The contract will enable ASPE to partner with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in funding a research and technical assistance center (RTAC) at Boston College whose principal purpose is to diffuse the specialized knowledge and expertise about innovative approaches to consumer-directed services gained through the implementation of the original Cash and Counseling Demonstration and Evaluation (CCDE) co-sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and ASPE.  In 2004, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Retirement Research Fund awarded grants to twelve new states to design and implement cash and counseling options within their Medicaid programs similar to those previously implemented in Arkansas, New Jersey, and Florida under the original Cash and Counseling Demonstration.  Other states have since received or will receive grants from other sources (e.g. the Retirement Research Fund, Centers for Medicare/Medicaid, the Administration on Aging) to replicate cash and counseling programs with Medicaid or Older Americans Act funding for the benefits themselves. Therefore, a major requirement for the contractor is expertise and experience with regard to the planning and implementation of cash and counseling programs in a variety of state settings.  Boston College has, on staff, the project director for the CCDE, who clearly possesses the relevant expertise and experience.  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Retirement Research Fund have already awarded grants totaling $7.5 million for this initiative to the Boston College School of Social and the participating states.  Any other contractor capable of providing this service would have to have 1) expertise and experience with respect to the Cash and Counseling Demonstration and Evaluation sufficient to provide extensive technical assistance to states on replicating the cash and counseling innovation in their states and 2) provide a source of funds for approximately half the cost of supporting technical assistance to states around implementing cash and counseling replication programs.  This sole source modification has been justified in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.    The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as described above including a specific statement addressing the second factor listed above (source of additional funding).  No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements should be submitted within 45 days of the publication of this synopsis to the contact point and address given above.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under simplified acquisition procedures (threshold of $100,000) a government purchase order to American Indian Health Management & Policy, Inc., 650 North, 2nd. Ave., Phoenix, AZ. 85003-1519 for the following services under NAICS Code of 541618.  In the CMS Tribal Technical Advisory Groups five-year American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) Strategic Action Plan for the Agency, one of the top priorities identified is the need for annual Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP training tailored to the unique needs of Indian Country.  They recommend that CMS Tribal Affairs Group work with Regional Offices and partners, such as the Indian Health Service and Tribal Health Boards, ensure that 1 to 2 days of training on an annual basis will be provided in each of the twelve (12) Indian Health Service geographic areas. The target audience will be the provider and administrative staffs of the ITU system as well as Tribal leaders. CMS intends to provide training tailored to the needs of providers in the Indian Health Service, Tribe and Tribal Organization and Urban Indian Health Care system (ITU), as well as other key stakeholders, such as Tribal Leaders.  The purpose is to increase understanding of our programs and their ability to do further outreach to American Indian and Alaska Native beneficiaries who are eligible to enroll in our programs.   Tribal Leaders will better understand the role that CMS plays in increasing access to health care services for their tribal members and understand better the efforts to enroll members of their communities in Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP. This contract will facilitate the development of a series of training modules related to Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP as these programs pertain to those mentioned above.  CMS program regulations apply uniquely to ITU health care programs and the contractor will ensure that the training modules incorporate not only information about the programs in general but the unique differences applicable to Indian Country as well.  Existing training provided by CMS does not address the unique attributes of how Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP apply to ITUs and are therefore confusing to ITU providers and Tribal leaders. Successful development and execution of these specific training modules requires a team with a unique set of expertise. They must have an intimate knowledge of AI/AN culture and communication; current working relationships with key members of the Indian healthcare community; as well as academic, clinical, and practical backgrounds and a working understanding of CMS programs. American Indian Health Management & Policy (AIHMP) works in partnership with Tribal programs, government agencies, and healthcare service providers to more effectively meet the healthcare needs of American Indians. AIHMP strives to assist these entities in delivering modern methods in culturally appropriate ways.  AIHMP has a unique team with clinical and academic training combined with expertise in health policy, public health, health administration, and private sector insurance. They have specialized understanding and first hand experience in American Indian health system including 3rd party billing and collections by Indian health facilities.
AIHMP has a current working relationship with American Indian/Alaska Native communities and Tribes. 
AIHMP works with Tribal programs to better understand their healthcare options, design effective and culturally appropriate healthcare programs for their communities, and learn how to more effectively work with government agencies. Their services to Tribal programs include:Health Program Development and Feasibility Studies to Expand Services;Program Evaluations, Strategic Planning and Gap Analyses;Strategies to Improve Access To Healthcare Services;Education Programs (Indian Health Policy, Health Information, Etc.);Cultural Awareness Training and Culturally Relevant Marketing Programs;Third-Party Billing Services. AIHMP helps healthcare service providers better understand the beliefs, values, and communication styles that must be addressed to effectively provide modern medical products and services to American Indians. The skills, knowledge and expertise AIHMP bring to the table are uniquely suited to CMS Tribal Affairs Groups training requirements. Culturally competent training for this special, complex, and diverse audience requires the balance of skills. All other interested parties must possess the same level of expertise as the intended sole source and have a current existing relationship with the intended audience of American Indian/Alaska Native.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The acquisition method is negotiated procurement.  Both a technical proposal and a price proposal will be required.  The basis for award is Best Value Tradeoff.  This process permits tradeoffs among costs or price and non-cost factors and allows the Gove rnment to award to a superior offeror which is not the lowest priced offer but which is significantly more technically advantageous than the lowest offeror so as to justify payment of a higher price.  It is the Governments intent to award based on initial  offers without discussions.  Evaluation factors may consists of the following: (1) Past Performance on projects similar in nature; (2) Specialized experience in constructing DoD facilities that serve as part of the world-wide satellite communications netw ork, employing high reliability power and HVAC systems, foundations and utility interconnectivity with satellite communications antennas, and control & monitoring for restricted access to the complex ; (3) Key Personnel, including construction members;  (4 ) Project Management Plan that emphasizes communications with and responsiveness to multiple users that will share the facility; ability to respond to user-installed equipment technology upgrades throughout the construction period, and aggressiveness in me eting or exceeding the construction period timelines, and (5) Small Business Utilization Opportunities.  The aforementioned evaluation factors may not be all inclusive. Sub-contracting plans are required for all construction contracts awarded to a large business when the award amount exceeds $1,000,000.00.  If the offeror is a large business, the firm will be required to submit a sub-contracting plan as part of their prop osal package.  The plan shall be prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  Failure to submit an acceptable  sub-contracting plan may make the bidder ineligible for award of the contact.  To be acceptable, the plan must adequately address the six required statutory elements and provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to answer affirmativ ely questions A through H of appendix DD, Part 2, AFARS 19.705.

Task 1.5 OMB Package.  The CDC will provide a draft of the OMB documents.  The contractor shall provide written comments and suggestions (inside a Microsoft Word document) concerning CDC’s OMB packet
Task 1.6   Make Improvements to Attendance Tracking System.  The contractor shall make improvements necessary to their site’s attendance tracking capability.  If site does not have a reliable electronic attendance tracking capability (as determined by CDC), they must purchase new software to permit reliable tracking (into the future) of all patients’ attendance at primary medical care visits.
Task 1.7  Create Attendance Database.  The contractor shall create a clinic-wide database on attendance using clinic records. The database shall track forward in time all clinic patients’ attendance at primary medical care visits, using patient identifiers.  
Task 1.8 Data Manager Training.  The contractor shall participate in a two-day data manager training at CDC, during the first 12 months of project.  This training will supply to the contractors the format and software for medical record abstraction, and clinic attendance data submissions.  Quality control procedures, (e.g., double checking of data values) will be included in the training.
Task 1.9  Local IRB Submission and Approval.  The contractor shall submit the CDC-approved protocol for local-site IRB approval.  Following approval, contractor shall deliver to CDC the IRB approval letter and a copy of the IRB-approved consent form with approval and date indicated. .
Task 1.10  Patient Contact Instruments.  The contractor shall develop instruments that capture Case Manager and Outreach worker documentation of patient contacts. These instruments will produce the data that will document the consistency with which the intervention is delivered across time. The minimum format will be specified at the Data Manager Training (Task 1.8)..
Task 1.11  Quarterly Reports.  Submit quarterly progress reports to CDC. The minimum content of the quarterly reports shall be: project personnel in place (by name) during the quarter; changes in personnel or major duties that occurred during the quarter; data collected and submitted by type and shipment date; number of subjects screened; number of subjects enrolled; number of medical chart abstractions. 

ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT FOR PHASE 1
Based on 2080 hours per year.
Principal Investigator:   416 hours
Study Coordinator:  624 hours
Data Manager/Analyst:  624 hours


2.  PHASE 2—PRE-OMB APPROVAL:  (12 months from date of award through 24 months from date of award).  Unless otherwise specified all activities pertain to both Panel A and B clinics.  We anticipate that there will be minimal activities in Phase 2 because we will be waiting for OMB approval.  Staffing should reflect the reduced workload.
Task 2.1 Investigators Meetings: The contractor shall attend a two-day investigators meeting at CDC to refine intervention responsiblities of clinic staff, refine the intervention timeline, plan for the intervention training, and participate in bi-weekly conference calls during the year.
Task 2.2  Study Collaboration and Manual:  The contractor shall continue to work towards  preparing to put study in the field.  Contractor shall prepare sections of the intervention training manual that are to be used by study staff members and providers in his clinic. The manual shall include how clinic patients are being approached and recruited into the measurement cohort; the plans for delivering the intervention and oversight of the intervention; and plans for submitting data. 
Task 2.3  Attendance Database:  The contractor shall make quarterly transmissions to CDC in Atlanta of the clinic-wide database on patient attendance. See Task 1.7 for database requirements.
Task 2.4 Quarterly Reports:  The contractor shall submit quarterly progress reports to CDC.  See task 1.11 for required content.

ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT FOR PHASE 2
Principal Investigator:   416 hours

3.  PHASE 3—COHORT ENROLLMENT AND INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTATATION  (24 months from date of award through 36 months from date of award).  Unless otherwise specified all activities pertain to both Panel A and B clinics.

After contract award, CDC will determine which clinics will be randomly assigned to implement the intervention immediately (Panel A clinics) and which will delay implementation for approximately one year (Panel B clinics).  Phase 3 therefore is presented in 2 options, and the offerors’ proposal must include both options.  

Option 3A.    Panel A clinics will implement the intervention during Phase 3,and should therefore include appropriate staffing.
 Option 3B.   Panel B clinics, the control group clinics, will enroll their cohort during phase 3  but will not implement the intervention during phase 3.  Requirements for study-specific case management and peer outreach should not be included. Appropriate staffing is to be included by Panel B clinics.

Task 3.1  Investigators Meeting:  The contractor shall attend a two-day investigators meeting at CDC to finalize intervention procedures, and revise timelines.   The contractor shall continue to participate in bi-weekly conference calls.
Task 3.2  Cohort Enrollment:  Identify and enroll a cohort of at least 250 patients during a 4 to 6-month period from the clinic-wide data base.  This cohort should include sufficient numbers of patients who have attended clinic inconsistently.  Attempts should be made to enroll all new patients during the patient enrollment period. 
Task 3.3   Administer Questionnaires.  These are to be administered  to the minimum of 250 cohort members.
Task 3.4   Medical chart Abstraction .  Contractor shall perform medical chart abstractions of each cohort member, using the methodology given at the Data Manager Training at CDC (Phase 1).  The minimum content for the abstractions shall include CD4+ Tcell counts, HIV viral load, AIDS-defining conditions, and therapeutic regimens.   What is entailed in the Chart Review process?
Task 3.5   Quality Control .  Contractor shall perform quality control procedures of data collection. Quality control procedure will be specified in detail by CDC at the Data Manager Training (Phase 1, Task 1.8).
Task 3.6   Attendance Data:  The contractor shall tabulate patient clinic attendance before and after the intervention using clinic attendance records.  This shall include attendance data for the clinic-wide population as well as the cohort.  The format for that part of the attendance data to be transmitted to CDC will be specified at the Data Manager Training (Phase 1, Task 1.8).
Task 3.7   Transmitting Data.   Transmit attendance, medical chart data, survey (questionnaire) and patient contact data to the CDC over the secure data network.
Task 3.8  Intervention Training-Panel A.  The contractor’s clinic staff shall participate in a four-hour intervention training at the clinic site (Panel A clinics).  The intervention training is to be conducted by a separately funded training contractor, and will require clinic staff to participate in a series of adult learning activities (e.g., written exercises, role playing).

<DESC>Project Objectives
The procedures of the study, including the intervention, will be designed by CDC and HRSA with collaborative input from the contractors.  The objective of this contract is for contractors to conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine an intervention to increase retention of HIV+ patients in primary medical care.  Contractors will implement and oversee the trial, assure its quality, and supply CDC and HRSA with relevant outcome data described below. We anticipate that the intervention will increase HIV patient retention at least 30% relative to the rates before the intervention.  If found to be efficacious, the government will be able to disseminate this intervention to HIV primary care clinics throughout the United States.   
 Scope of Work
?	The intervention will be implemented and tested for efficacy at six HIV primary care clinics.  Clinic attendance (from clinic records) is the primary outcome variable.  Three clinics (Panel A clinics) will be randomly selected to implement the intervention immediately after baseline clinic data are tabulated and a cohort of patients enrolled and surveyed at each of the six sites; the other three clinics (Panel B clinics) will delay implementation of the intervention for approximately 12 months and will serve as a control group for evaluating the efficacy of the intervention as delivered by Panel A clinics during the prior year.  The first follow-up tabulation of attendance will occur at each clinic after this 12-month intervention period.  Panel B clinics will then implement the intervention for 12 months (and Panel A clinics will continue implementing the intervention). Follow-up tabulation of attendance will be made at each of the six clinics.
Basic design of the study is shown below

<DESC>******** DUE DATE FOR RESPONSES IS EXTENDED TO 20 JUL 2006 AT 3PM CST ***********
This is not a Request for proposal and the Government will not pay for any information requested in this Request For Information (RFI).  Responses will be done at no cost to the Government.  The government is contemplating a firm fixed price type of contract to fulfill this requirement.  Initial research indicates this service is commercial in nature and we are soliciting beneficial commercial practices, terms and conditions for consideration.  It will be the contractor’s responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions in any resultant Request for Proposal and awarded contract.
The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) is responsible for the management and operation of thirteen Air Force Bases located in several southern states.  Three of AETC’s bases are located in the electrically deregulated part of Texas: Sheppard AFB near Wichita Falls, TX, Goodfellow AFB near San Angelo, TX, and Laughlin AFB near Del Rio, TX.  These bases have an aggregated energy requirement of approximately 225,000 Megawatt Hours per year and a peak demand of approximately 45 Megawatts.  For these bases, AETC is interested in developing an aggregated electric supply solution.  AETC is considering the use of a special purpose Retail Electric Provider (REP).  AETC believes that a special purpose REP will create opportunities for AETC to more economically manage its forward supply needs utilizing a portfolio purchasing method that will allow further opportunities for AETC to purchase a mix of generation types (traditional and renewable fuels), while lending flexibility for the purchase of unique renewable resources (i.e., solar, landfill gas, wind, municipal solid waste).  Purchases of renewable energy resources are required under the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  To achieve these objectives AETC wishes to identify an Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market participant that is a registered Retail Electric Provider.
As part of Market Research, this Request for Information (RFI) will be used to determine if there is more than one Retail Energy Provider (REP) capable of providing the services described above.  Also, based on the responses to this RFI a determination of suitability for small business set aside will be made.
The North American Industry System Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 221122 with a maximum size standard for small business designation of 4 million megawatt hours per year.  Once Market Research has been completed, the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be placed on the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  It will be the responsibility of prospective offerors’ to check this site regularly for any postings or changes.  Prospective offerors’ must be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Registration (CCR) and must be qualified to perform in the correct NAICS code as aforementioned.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov.  All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  All prospective offerors’ shall indicate their size standard (large business, small business, 8a, HUBZone, SDB/8(a), SD-VOSB, VOSB, WOSB, etc.) when replying to this RFI.  Provide a single point-of-contact to include an e-mail address, your Federal Cage Code, and your Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.  
In your response briefly describe your company, years of experience in the Texas market as an REP, number of employees, and the physical locations of (i) your main offices, (ii) your REP operations, (iii) your QSE operations, and (iv) your back office services.  
Please provide answers for each of the following, utilizing the existing numbering scheme for each response, and limiting your total response for this RFI to no more than fifteen (15) pages:

7.	Describe the ancillary benefits that will be made available to the AETC, such as key market data for ERCOT.  Can you provide on-line web based real time energy consumption information? 
8.	From your perspective what are the advantages and/or disadvantages of having the AETC’s REP be certified as a QSE.  What level of certification would be the most advantageous?
9.	Describe the credit resources available to your company.  For this effort what is your suggested minimum credit position?   State your willingness/ability to provide a parental guarantee of performance.
10.	State the minimum time required to make these REP services available to serve AETC needs after contract award.

If you are a large business under NAICS 221122 will you be able to meet these goals?  If not, why not?

16. Have you used the Department of Defense web-based invoicing system (Wide Area Workflow, https://wawf.eb.mil/)?  Are you aware of any specific problems with using this system for this contract? 
17. Would you prefer a contract with a ten (10) year period of performance or an indefinite term contract (indefinite term contract means a month-to-month contract for utility services that may be terminated by the Government upon proper notice)?  
Responses are due NLT 3:00PM CST on 6 Jul 2006.  Any responses received after this date may not be considered.   Any response to this RFI submitted by a prospective offeror shall be submitted at no cost to the Government and the Government is in no way obligated by the information received.
Any question(s) MUST be directed to BOTH:
jerry.strubbe@randolph.af.mil and
debbie.aguirre@randolph.af.mil
E-mail is the acceptable means for submittal, questions or inquires.

STATEMENT OF WORK 
(SOW)
 
 
DATE:  05/23/2007
 
 
 
1.0  General.  Exterior Surface Sealing - Building #1 A&CC
 
1.1  Introduction.  The exterior surface area of the building requires power washing, clear sealant application, and control joint/window caulking to provide protection against weather damage.
 
1.2  Background.  The MSHA Approval and Certification Center (A&CC) facility is government owned and located in Triadelphia, WV.  The facility encompasses 96 acres of grounds with six office and/or laboratory buildings.  Building 1 is mainly comprised of office space for government employees with two laboratories located on the first floor.  It is considered the main building for the facility which often receives visitors for various purposes.  The building is masonry block construction requiring periodic treatment to provide weather proofing and eliminate water intrusion.  It has been 15 plus years since the building was last sealed.  As a result, the building is experiencing leaks that create safety hazards such as ceiling tile becoming saturated to the point of falling.  The leaks are also a threat to the expensive laboratory equipment used by the Center to approve mining equipment.  There is an additional concern that the leaks are creating a wet environment and the potential for harmful mold growth.
 
 1.3  Objectives.  To have a transparent weather-proof seal applied to the exterior of the building with all control joints and windows caulked to eliminate current and prevent future water intrusion occurring during severe weather.  
 
1.4  Scope.  Approximately 21,200 square feet of masonry surface will require cleaning and/or preparation prior to the application of the sealant.  The surface will be cleaned so it is free of loose debris, dust, mildew, oils, and grease.  Approximately 2,850 square feet of caulking will be required for all control joints and windows of the building.  The existing caulking will be removed prior to the installation of new caulking.  When the building is clean and dry a single coat of a clear weather-proofer for concrete and masonry containing siloxane will be applied to all exterior masonry surfaces of the building.  The sealant will be applied in a manner to ensure adequate coverage allowing the sealant to penetrate into the masonry pores.  The sealant may have a milky appearance upon application but must dry clear.  Any discoloration or significant change in the appearance of the building is not acceptable.   

The work is weather dependent and is anticipated to be performed during an agreed upon time between the government and vendor when the building is unoccupied by federal employees.  The negotiated timeframe will take into consideration allowing the building to be free of all odors caused by the work effort.  Needed utilities such as water and electricity will be provided by the government at the facility.  The center will provide the appropriate staff such as guards and maintenance personnel as necessary for the oversight of the work effort.  The contractor will provide labor, materials, and waste disposal as appropriate for this project.

1.5  Contract Type.  Firm Fixed Price Contract
 
1.6	Place of Performance/Hours of Operation.  The building where the work will be performed is a government-owned structure and is identified as Building #1.  the location of the building is within the Center?s confines at the following address:

The Center is located just off the Dallas Pike exit of Interstate 70 near Wheeling, WV.  Directions to the Center can be found on the web at the following address: 
	http://www.msha.gov/TECHSUPP/ACC/directions.pdf

 
1.7  Period of Performance.  The period of performance for this project is only the time needed to successfully complete the outlined work and be acceptable to the government.  It is anticipated that the work would require a minimum of 2 days but no more than 5 days to complete.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The project includes a 12,863 SF clinic, a 1,682 SF (approximately 121 foot long) connector to the existing hospital, and a 1,596 SF Entry/Drop-off. This project will provide an elevated one-story steel frame and concrete addition on pile foundations, with a concrete slab, concrete and glass exterior, a modified bitumen roof, and all mechanical and electrical systems.  It will be an adequately sized, efficient, modern, hurricane-protected Diagnostic Imaging Center for the Radiation Oncology Clinic to serve the eligible beneficiaries in the Biloxi/Gulfport MS area. The project also includes two linear accelerator vaults, a simulator room, exam rooms, physician offices, physicists' work areas and offices with support spaces.  With greater building heights being required by the linear accelerators with their vault shielding requirements, floor to floor heights are separate and independent of the existing hospital building.  An enclosed connector corridor ties the new addition back to the hospital's outpatient clinic through a vertical circulation element of the existing hospital. Expressly list the following as technical requirements demonstrated on similar type projects completed in the last 3 years. The vaults require specialized high-density concrete varying from 3.5 to 8 feet thick, placed at walls and roof. The vaults require special shielded doors, containing lead plate and borated panels, weighing between 3000 and 5000 pounds each. The doors are electrically operated. The Simulator Room will contain a CT scanner, which requires specialized shielding in the walls. The Lin Acc?s require special power conditioning gear (electrical) for the power supply.  High-end finishes to compete with private sector radiation oncology facilities.  This has resulted in the selection of several unusual finish systems and decorative items/devices.  The building directly connects to a working hospital.  Systems are all tied to the hospital systems (plumbing, med gas, elect, chilled water, steam, comm. and fire alarm/mass notification.
  The construction duration will be less than or equal to 545 calendar days from date of contract award.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry.  Responses to this RFI are strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporations ability to submit an offer if and when a solicitation is released.  There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.  The requested information is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.  No entitlement of payment by the government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors information.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Please note the actual NAICS code that will be applicable to this Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) effort is 541990-All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services.

INTRODUCTION: The 311 HSW/PKAC, Brooks City-Base, TX, is planning to award Advisory and Assistance Services in support of the areas of Human Systems Integration (HSI) expertise to accomplish several efforts on defense acquisition and sustainment programs.  This RFI is issued to determine the capability of prospective contractors to provide comprehensive HSI services.  These services include expertise in the HSI domain areas of: Manpower, Personnel, Training, Environment, Safety, Occupational Health, Human Factors Engineering, Habitability, and Survivability, as well as finance, human performance, instructional development, logistics, marketing, human resource development, data mining, concept mapping, metrics, and systems engineering.

BACKGROUND:  The Air Force requires a sound HSI strategy in acquisition programs as a highly effective method of saving the Air Force significant costs during the life cycle of systems and improving total system performance.  A sound HSI strategy puts the warfighter at the center of the design process and equips the warfighter rather than manning the equipment.  Early application of HSI leads to cost avoidance in terms of manpower, personnel, training, and human error.  To achieve this requirement, the Air Force seeks business and industry familiar with DoD and/or commercial systems and application of HSI on those systems. 

SCOPE:  This request for information is directed to highly competitive potential prime contractors who can demonstrate the capability to provide HSI knowledge and experience and understand how the application of HSI benefits the acquisition process and affects total life cycle costs in the design, development, integration, and fielding of programs.  The Government recognizes that HSI practitioners are limited and therefore at this point in the market research process, the Government would like to continue dialog with those Industry partners who feel they could be a viable prime contractor.

The Government will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to refine the requirements and acquisition strategy for the following tasks:

Generate HSI concept maps that will validate an existing HSI Assessment Tool that will be used to assess HSI & Human Performance methods and processes for all systems regardless of acquisition phase.

Research and draft policies to include: HSI process into Joint Capabilities Integration Development System (JCIDS); HSI-related Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs) into capability documents; and feasibility study for implementing a blanket HSI KPP or mandating key HSI-relevant KPP/KSAs based on human performance concerns.

Identify HSI drivers associated with existing Air Force operational metrics with either an explicit or implicit human component (i.e., aircraft availability, maintenance).

Transform the existing Air Force Process Sequence Models (PSMs) into Integrated Manpower and Personnel Integration (IMPRINT) models for the purpose of conducting HSI capability based assessments.

Provide support (i.e., standardizing, maintaining, and marketing) and data mining new information for inclusion on the existing HSI Community of Practice (an informational repository on a .mil restricted site) residing on the Air Force Knowledge Now website.

Conduct research, identify key internal and external partnership opportunities, and draft memorandum of agreements and/or understanding with strategic agencies into an existing HSI Collaborations database.

Research and define an HSI Instructional Design Strategy (front-end analysis) that focuses on HSI Practitioner career development and HSI training needs throughout the Air Force.

Research, develop, and reverse engineer, if required, HSI costing methodologies on existing system acquisition programs.  Contractors collectively must have program management and HSI experience and access to SECRET information.

Develop an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) HSI-relevant project transition roadmap.

Develop a professional tradeshow to include a HSI promotional and marketing strategy, communication plan, and conference display booth that supports multiple target audience messages and visitor survey capability.


DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: The Information package should include the following items:

1.  Do you qualify under the 8(a) program? If you are a small business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories (small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, HUBzone small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business or veteran-owned small business)?

<DESC>1.  INTRODUCTION: a. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Department of Defense (DoD) is not seeking proposals, and will not be responsible for reimbursing cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested  partys expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP.  If a RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/.  It is the responsibility  of potential offerors to monitor this website, and any other pertinent website for additional information pertaining to this requirement. b. The request is for information only and will allow the Army to identify alternative technical approaches and develop an estimate of program cost and effectiveness.  As part of the first phase, the Army may conduct an information exchange meeting with re presentative companies under each of the alternatives cited in Paragraph 2, below.  It is anticipated that these meetings will take place in the July timeframe or earlier.  As stated in Paragraph a., this does not constitute a RFP.  Life cycle costing info rmation will strictly be used as an aid in ascertaining a Government estimate for these candidate representative solutions as a means to completion of the required Economic Analysis. 2.  PURPOSE:  The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to support the investigative case management system utilized by the DoD CITF. The government is looking for information in the following categories: (1) firms that have the resources (people an d facilities); (2) Commercial Off-the Shelf (COTS) or Government Off-the Shelf (GOTS) products capable of fulfilling the CITFs needs as they are determined; (3) a combination of categories (1) and (2); and (4) development of a personnel manning solution that would fulfill CITF sourcing needs within the stated timeframe. 3. BACKGROUND: The CITF has sole responsibility for conducting the investigation of alleged or suspected war crimes, acts of terrorism, and other related offenses committed by non-U.S. citizens against the United States or U.S. personnel.  The CITF provide s DoD a unique joint investigative capability tailored to the specific terrorist target and specifically designed to support the Global War. The CITF utilizes a centralized case management and investigation information automation system that provides a means of tracking and saving all collected investigative/intelligence information with reports being automatically populated and published; as w ell internal data mining tools for developing investigative leads This investigative information system structure allows for critical link analysis on the fly, which means an investigator/analyst will have all previous reports and incidents related to the subject at his or her finger tips during subsequent investigations. The main location of service will be at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. One position may be located at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, Cuba.  Travel outside the National Capital Region will be n eeded on an opportune basis and managed by exception. 4.  TIME FRAMES:  For planning purposes, this RFI is being conducted in support of an acquisition decision in the August 2007 timeframe.  5.  CAPABILITIES:  The functional responsibilities listed below provide the Investigative Case Management System requirements. Those responding to this request,  must categorize responses by identifying capabilities that currently exist, capabilities curre ntly under development, and capabilities that can be planned and scheduled.  For each of these three categories, responses are expected to address each subpar agraph below.  All responses must be accompanied by a plan addressing the approach, including a schedule, which describes the candidate technology and proposed approach for the CITF Investigative Case Management System, method of supply/delivery (e.g. full  delivery or spiral delivery with proposed approach to provide full capability), training, deployment, maintenance and sustainment.  Responses must also include information on licensing arrangements, if applicable, and an estimate of cost for the developme nt, training, deployment, maintenance and sustainment of the Investigative Case Management System. Responses are not to exceed the maximum equivalent of 20 pages, including schedules. Functional Requirements Overview The Contractor shall initially be able to provide no less than eighty percent immediately functionally qualified personnel to support all aspects of the CITFs investigative case management mission. An illustration of how the CITF employs its central over -arching case investigative information system follows. The over-arching case information management system is utilized to identify investigative leads and prepare prosecutorial material against enemy detainees awaiting trial by Military Commission.  It has been and continues to be the CITFs major informatio n technology (IT) tool in support of the war on terror. It performs critical investigative mission functions that are not duplicated by any other single information management system or group of management information systems that are collectively availabl e to the investigative special agents.  Because many of the specific CITF missions supported by this system are classified, an exhaustive list of critical missions supported by it is unavailable.   This case investigative management system assist CITF in examining, investigating and verifying potential participant object relationships to identify, track and investigate potential or suspected terrorists.  Participant object relationships, simply d escribed, represent the relationship of the individual detainee to his/her environment, including the detainees friends, family members, related institutions, sources of financing, and group (including terrorist group) affiliations.   The case investigative management system serves as the central point for gathering of information from a wide variety of sources, integrates that information, and presents this information to CITF agents in an easily comprehensible form.  It thus facilitat es and expedites agents recognition of potential significant object relationships and answer, for each detainee, such critical questions as:  Who is he?  Where has he been?  Who does he know?  Who knows him?  Where has he trained, schooled?  When did he t rain, who trained with him?  What is his travel history?  How does he support himself?   Detection of potential object relationships often requires review of a huge amount of data in which trends and commonalities are not readily apparent even to a skilled agent.  The case investigative management systems ability to process this data almost i nstantaneously allows CITF to quickly, effectively and efficiently identify investigative leads.  Further, once an initial investigation is completed, the case investigative system provides critical support to military or if required civilian justice opera tions and prosecution of war crimes.  The case investigative management system is capable of supporting the ultimate prosecution of an individual in any law enforcement arena whether it is military commissions, US or international court. The case management system contains all the investigativ e and intelligence information that is available to the prosecutors used in the conduct of the commissions in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It is the only information source accredited by the CITF and the Office of Military Commission (OMC). During the conduct of the commissions, all exhibits will be provided to the  court and detainee from this system.  The CITF case investigative management system is the repository of the case history of the detainee and as such represents the accumulation of evidence supporting the guilt (or innocence) of the detainee. It facilitat es the development of Reason to Believe (RTB) statements that are prepared to assist the President in making his decision whether or not to approve this detainee for trial.  Purpose The purpose of this document is to set forth the CITFs functional requirements and specifications for a web-based Investigative Case Management System. The remaining personnel must be fully capable within two month. General requirements and operational co ncepts are provided in the following subsections. General Description  This requirement document is written from the procurement and contracting perspective. The system shall provide the user interface and capability to meet the CITF demands highlighted in the overview. Applicable Documents The system shall comply with all applicable requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (DFAR), DoD  Financial Management Regulation (DoD FMR) and Army Regulation 37-1.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above with 45 calendar days from the date of this synopsis. The USGS Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) is designed to organize, modernize, and standardize operations of seismic networks in the United States to improve the Nation's ability to respond effectively to damaging earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis. The U.S. Geological Survey, Geologic Discipline, Geologic Hazards Team, has a requirement for the following: Support installation, configuration and operation of ANSS Regional Networks. 1.	CISN Display is an application that rapidly receives earthquake information distributed by seismic networks operating in the United States via the Internet.  2.	SeisNetWatch allows seismic network operators to monitor and control the state of health of their networks or other networks distributed across the Internet.  3.	SHAPE is a tool for easily building Dataless SEED volumes.  4.	Earthworm is a seismic processing system used at over a dozen ANSS regional seismic networks. Maintaining existing software, creating the Earthworm distributions and supporting to ANSS regional networks. 5.	Earthquake Information Distribution System (EIDS). EIDS is the messaging infrastructure used to synchronize summary earthquake products among USGS data centers and ANSS regional seismic networks.  6.	XYZ the software package consisting of a user interface (GUI) and associated software used to support seismic waveform data quality control (QC) analysis.   7.	INV (Inventory/Response) is a software package which provides a method to track instrumentation used at the ANSS Backbone Network and generate updated response information when station configurations are changed. 8.	AutoDRM is a software package that allows ANSS customers to request stations metadata and waveform data from the National Earthquake Information Center database. III.	Product Development  Develop a series of new products and enhance existing products. These products will enhance the ANSS' ability to generate earthquake information and to deliver the earthquake information reliability.  The development process will follow a four phase approach. The phases will be:  1.	Definition of Product Functional Requirements:   Develop, prioritize, and document the functional requirements.   2.	Design Document the design including description of data flow, high level modules, their functions, and technical specifications.  Implementation based on the requirements and High Level Design.  3.	Delivery Develop a strategy for deployment of the product. 4. Work breakdown structure and implementation   A.	National Inventory (NI) The ANSS requires a national station inventory.  The inventory should include station names and coordinates, instrumentation types, site characteristics, cooked responses, etc.  The NI will be implemented in two stages. The first phase product would provide a list of ANSS station names and coordinates.  ANSS would like the data to be mined from SeisNetWatch, because SeisNetWatch runs at all ANSS networks.  The list should be updated at regular intervolves and should provide the ability to manually cause an update. Stage II of the national inventory would include instrument type, site characteristics, cooked responses, and other station information. Stage II of will have three parts: 1) mining the data from each network, 2) collecting the data at one or more points, and 3) making the aggregate data available. The collecting of the data would use existing ANSS tools and commercial tools such as the EIDS messaging system and the SeisNetWatch monitoring software.  The storage of this data could be as simple as compiling a list or as complex as centrally synchronizing response metadata information across ANSS networks.  At a minimum, the data would have to be collected, updated, organized, and stored and reports would be generated. B.	Metadata Server Access to information required to process seismic data or to describe earthquake products is a critical requirement for most ANSS National Operation Center (NOC) subsystems as well systems at the ANSS regional seismic networks.  This metadata includes information such as station locations, channel responses, geographic names, important cities, and significant earthquakes.   To satisfy the need for metadata availability, central, redundant Metadata Servers are required.  This would involve: "	Data storage containing a diverse collection of easily accessible metadata parameters, "	Server processes supporting many concurrent, light weight clients,  "	Support applications for maintaining metadata holdings, and  "	A mechanism for replicating holdings with other (possibly remote) Metadata Servers. Types of Metadata Initially, the Metadata Server will be designed to manage and serve the Geographic and Station metadata.  However, the likelihood that the types of metadata required will increase in the future should be taken into account in the server design.   Geographic (accessed by latitude and longitude) 1.	Region names 2.	Important cities 3.	Time zones 4.	Railroad stations 5.	Earthquake statistics 6.	Tectonic summaries 7.	Significant earthquakes 8.	Station locations (the same information may be accessed geographically or by station code) Station (accessed by network, station, location, and channel code) 1.	Station locations (the same information may be accessed by station code or geographically) 2.	Station descriptions 3.	Station aliases 4.	Station instrumentation 5.	Channel descriptions 6.	Instrument responses C.	Regional Network Earthquake Processing System (RNEPS). The ANSS plans to standardize on one earthquake processing system to be used at the ANSS Tier 1 and Tier 2 regional seismic networks. The system will be used for earthquake data acquisition, automatic processing, interactive analysis, and earthquake information distribution.  Integrate the software into a package with the latest version of Earthworm. The package will be documented and ready to compile "out of the box" for Solaris platforms along with the Oracle database and post processing modules. Document the system with an overview of the system and in sufficient detail that users will be able to configure the modules of the system without needing to look at code. D.	Installation of the RNEPS at ANSS Regional Networks Assist the ANSS regional networks in installing the RNEPS at ANSS Regional Seismic Networks (RSN), and conduct a training course either at the RSN facility or the contractor's facility. E.	Automatic QC software The motivation for automatic quality control (AutoQC) of seismic waveform data is two fold: 1) the ability to apply some level of QC to all ANSS waveform data and 2) the ability to control seismic processing based on waveform quality. The USGS envisions the AutoQC being developed in three stages: Stage 1 will be the simplest form of AutoQC and would extend latency monitoring to include some basic waveform quality metrics (e.g., gaps, spikes, flat lines, large offsets, etc.).  This processing could be done in real-time or off-line with a delay of hours.  The essential outputs would be: 1) a periodic (e.g., daily) report of the state of the network and 2) flags suitable to suppress the use of poor waveforms in event association.  Automatically suppressing event association has the advantages of reducing false alarms when stations go bad and reducing thresholds when stations are repaired, all without human intervention.   Stage 2 of AutoQC would be to feed seismic processing information back into the QC (e.g., pick rate, pick residuals, and magnitude residuals.  In Stage 3, AutoQC effort could be extended to include state-of-health information (e.g., calibration on) and auxiliary channels (e.g., mass position).  It should also be possible to incorporate information about response issues determined through the ANSS probabilistic seismic noise subsystem. F. SeisNetWatch customized for Strong Motion Data The U.S. Geological Survey National Strong-Motion Project (NSMP) has the primary Federal responsibility for recording each damaging earthquake in the United States on the ground and in man-made structures in densely urbanized areas to improve public earthquake safety.  The NSMP maintains a national cooperative instrumentation network in support of this responsibility. The network consists of four hundred and twenty digital recorders (330 dial-up and 90 real-time) which are hooked up to telephone lines for rapid retrieval and interpretation of on-scale (strong-motion) measurements in urbanized.  The heart of the NSMP acquisition system is the Kinemetrics Network Management System (NMS) acquisition software. The NSMP would like upgrade this process to be more efficient.   Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the items specified as a sole source from Instrumental Software Technologies, Inc., New Paltz, NY, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm. However should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required item/services or its functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement. An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, request for such document without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice to the procurement. Please e-mail sctweten@USGS.gov. This is open to both large and small business. See note 22.

<DESC>This is not a Request for proposal and the Government will not pay for any information requested in this Request For Information (RFI).  Responses will be done at no cost to the Government.  The government is contemplating a firm fixed price type of contract to fulfill this requirement.  Initial research indicates this service is commercial in nature and we are soliciting beneficial commercial practices, terms and conditions for consideration.  It will be the contractor’s responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions in any resultant Request for Proposal and awarded contract.
The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) is responsible for the management and operation of thirteen Air Force Bases located in several southern states.  Three of AETC’s bases are located in the electrically deregulated part of Texas: Sheppard AFB near Wichita Falls, TX, Goodfellow AFB near San Angelo, TX, and Laughlin AFB near Del Rio, TX.  These bases have an aggregated energy requirement of approximately 225,000 Megawatt Hours per year and a peak demand of approximately 45 Megawatts.  For these bases, AETC is interested in developing an aggregated electric supply solution.  AETC is considering the use of a special purpose Retail Electric Provider (REP).  AETC believes that a special purpose REP will create opportunities for AETC to more economically manage its forward supply needs utilizing a portfolio purchasing method that will allow further opportunities for AETC to purchase a mix of generation types (traditional and renewable fuels), while lending flexibility for the purchase of unique renewable resources (i.e., solar, landfill gas, wind, municipal solid waste).  Purchases of renewable energy resources are required under the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  To achieve these objectives AETC wishes to identify an Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market participant that is a registered Retail Electric Provider.
As part of Market Research, this Request for Information (RFI) will be used to determine if there is more than one Retail Energy Provider (REP) capable of providing the services described above.  Also, based on the responses to this RFI a determination of suitability for small business set aside will be made.
The North American Industry System Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 221122 with a maximum size standard for small business designation of 4 million megawatt hours per year.  Once Market Research has been completed, the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be placed on the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  It will be the responsibility of prospective offerors’ to check this site regularly for any postings or changes.  Prospective offerors’ must be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Registration (CCR) and must be qualified to perform in the correct NAICS code as aforementioned.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov.  All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  All prospective offerors’ shall indicate their size standard (large business, small business, 8a, HUBZone, SDB/8(a), SD-VOSB, VOSB, WOSB, etc.) when replying to this RFI.  Provide a single point-of-contact to include an e-mail address, your Federal Cage Code, and your Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.  
In your response briefly describe your company, years of experience in the Texas market as an REP, number of employees, and the physical locations of (i) your main offices, (ii) your REP operations, (iii) your QSE operations, and (iv) your back office services.  
Please provide answers for each of the following, utilizing the existing numbering scheme for each response, and limiting your total response for this RFI to no more than fifteen (15) pages:

17. Would you prefer a contract with a ten (10) year period of performance or an indefinite term contract (indefinite term contract means a month-to-month contract for utility services that may be terminated by the Government upon proper notice)?  
Responses are due NLT 3:00PM CST on 6 Jul 2006.  Any responses received after this date may not be considered.   Any response to this RFI submitted by a prospective offeror shall be submitted at no cost to the Government and the Government is in no way obligated by the information received.

<DESC>Sources Sought Announcement - 
Joint Medical Strategic Sourcing Council - 
As of 29 May 2007 - 
Temporary Medical Staffing - 

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the government to acquire any product or services.  It does not guarantee a solicitation will be issued.  Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and shall not constitute a fee to the government.  The information requested will be used by the Joint Medical Strategic Sourcing Council (JMSSC) and the Department of Defense (DoD) to facilitate decision making.

As part of the Military Health System (MHS) transformation efforts outlined in the Quadrennial Defense Review, the JMSSC is seeking sources and relevant data to strategically procure temporary medical staffing services in military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) at geographically-dispersed Air Force, Army, and Navy installations in the 50 United States and its territories.  The work will supplement clinical support services provided by DoD military personnel, DoD civilian employees, or other contract staff.

Temporary medical staffing can be any occupation that provides direct patient care at the MTF.  Preliminary considerations focus on a broad spectrum of medical professionals which include both credentialed and noncredentialed caregivers.  These may include:  physicians, advanced practice nurses, registered nurses, certified medical technicians, and other direct patient care positions supporting MTF healthcare services.

Background:  Currently, these medical services are procured when needed by each MTF using a local base contracting office, other base contracting offices, centralized contracts and other non-agency contracts.   The mission of the JMSSC is to strategically, efficiently and effectively acquire MHS requirements by defining common specifications and leveraging resources.

Scope:  The program's scope, the type of contract that might be used, and acquisition methodology have not been determined. The geographic coverage area includes the 50 United States and territories.  The DoD is seeking large and small business sources as part of market research to ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity businesses can bring to the table to support anticipated professional services contract requirements. A review of available North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) codes finds NAICS 621111 (Offices of Physicians) with a size standard of $9.0M (3-year average annual receipts) and NAICS 621399 (Offices of All Other Miscellaneous Health Practitioners) with a size standard of $6.5M (3-year average annual receipts).  We are seeking comments on our NAICS code selection as well.

What the DoD needs:  If you are an interested large or small business, please respond to the attached questionnaire and provide the name, phone number, and e-mail address of a company representative we may contact for additional information.  Notice:  The DoD has non-government employees (i.e. contractor employees) assisting with our market research.  These non-government employees, who have all signed nondisclosure agreements, will have access to industry responses.  E-mailed responses are preferred, but paper submittals are acceptable.  Send responses to the following POCs no later than 20 Jun 07.  Any additional updates will be posted at www.fbo.gov.  Responses of fewer than 15 pages using 12-point Times New Roman font and 1-inch margins are preferred.  It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this site regularly for any changes or updates.

Please note, the government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI.

<DESC>THIS IS AN INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT PURSUANT TO FAR 6.302-1. THIS CONSTITUTES THE ONLY WRITTEN NOTICE, NO OTHER NOTICE OR SOLICITATION SHALL BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE. 
The MAF/TIGER System is the core of the Geographic Support System, which provides geographic products and services to a wide array of Census Bureau surveys, censuses, and programs.  The Census Bureau?s Geography Division has developed an interactive software application to view and update the redesigned MAF/TIGER database.  It interfaces with Oracle?s Topology Data Model and provides functionality that is unique to Census Bureau update operations.  The update system will be deployed to as many as 100-200 users in the Regional Offices, the National Processing Center, and at Headquarters.  

The Geography Division conducted a market research study to determine whether there were any COTS products that could be used for the interactive update system.  Two main requirements emerged from that study: 1) the product must support Oracle?s Topology Data Model, and 2) the product must be customizable in order to incorporate the MAF/TIGER business logic.  The additional requirement to deploy the software to many users across multiple sites made a web-based application highly desirable.  Acquis Inc. of Menlo Park, California met those requirements with their ADE (Acquis Data Editor) application that allows viewing and update of spatial data in an Oracle database.  ADE was designed to interface with Oracle?s Topology Data Model, and integrates well with the Oracle 10g database.  ADE is a web-based application that provides an architecture that enables developers to customize the application to meet specific business requirements.  The Geography Division has since built the interactive update system around ADE and acquired the necessary licenses for production operations.  The framework provided by Acquis saved months of software development effort.  The application is currently being used in production.  

The interactive update system will continue to be used and enhanced for at least the next five years.  During that time Acquis will be releasing updates to ADE with new functionality.  It is important for the Division to keep abreast of the latest releases and capabilities in ADE.  The Geography Division intends to meet that need via an ADE maintenance contract to include upgrades.

The period of performance shall be one year from the date of award with four (4) option periods for maintenance renewal. The government anticipates awarding a firm fixed price contract.  THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS OF ONLY ONE SOURCE: ACQUIS INCORPORATED, 149 Commonwealth Drive, Menlo Park, CA, 94025. Interested parties may submit information in accordance with this announcement, which will be considered, within 15 days of the posting of this announcement. As a result of analyzing responses to this synopsis of intent, the Contracting Officer may determine that the action may be competed. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. For questions concerning this procurement please contact Natalie Y. Ellis, Contract Specialist, at 301-763-3559.

The compressed gas cylinders shall be available in various sizes that a llow tailoring to operational missions in rugged environments and retain the ability to maintain 4500 psi.     2.     For compatibility with the SCBA, the cylinders are utilized in pairs in the following two configurations; a standard configuration (curren tly with volume of 285 cubic in. per cylinder) and a low-profile configuration (currently with a volume of 119 cubic in. per cylinder).     3.     The cylinder length shall be 20 inches, and shall not exceed an outside diameter of 5.5 inches for the standa rd cylinder configuration.     The low-profile cylinders shall also be 20 inches in length with a diameter no greater than 3.5 inches.     4. The cylinders must be capable of providing a minimum duration of 6 hours breathing time (5 hours filtered air/1 ho ur self-contained) as a component of a SCBA and a desired duration of 10 hours (6 hours of filtered air / 4 hours self-contained) in the maximum (larger) configuration.       5. The weight of the cylinder pairs will be less than 14 pounds for the standard cylinders, and less than 7.5 pounds for a pair of low-profile cylinders.       6. Cylinders must be capable of being used in a Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) environment and allow decontamination from Chemical Warfare Agent (CWA) threats, Toxic Industrial Chemicals and To xic Industrial Materials (TICs/TIMs).     7.

The proposal submission deadline was June 23, 2006.   In October 2006, the requiring agency was realigned with another government agency.  Due to funding issues caused by this realignment, more time is needed to fund and award proposals previously submitted.  For this reason the following change is being made: "Government reserves the right to fund any selectable proposal up to 18-months after the proposal submission date."   This time extension does NOT apply to submission of initial proposals.

Only those Large Account Resellers (LAR) under GSA Schedule 70, Information Technology (IT) Schedule, Special Item Number (SIN) 132-33, Perpetual Software Licensees will be considered for award. The performance period of this contract may not extend beyond the Contractors GSA Master Contract performance period.  All performance under this contract must be completed by no later than the end date of the final year of the Contractors GSA contract, unless the Contractors Master contract has been modified to extend the period of performance or it is renewed. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is CM1301-7-RQ-0005.  The solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-14. The full text of clauses referenced herein may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far/. The requirements will be fulfilled using the Simplified Acquisition procedures, Part 13 of the FAR, and the test program authorized in FAR 13.5 for acquisitions of commercial items not in excess of $10 Million. This acquisition is 100% set aside for small business. The NAICS code is 423430 and the associated small business size standard is 100 employees. The Government intends to award up to three (3) firm-fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) delivery order contracts for server and client licenses of an Electronic Communications and Messaging software product and associated services. The software product must contain a fully integrated desktop client and product suite which includes: email, calendar, task, contacts, instant messaging, global address, web access, and directory services (if required). The associated services will include all maintenance (patches), version upgrades, and technical support. The Government intends to make an award of an IDIQ delivery order contract(s) covering the following specific products: Microsoft solution, Lotus solution, and Sun solution.  These products represent over ninety percent (90%) of the DOC user and entertaining additional products would create a substantial duplication of cost to the department that is not expected to be recovered through competition and would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling Department of Commerce (DOC) requirements. The Justification for Approval is available upon request. The DOC intends to order the minimum quantity from each contract awarded for the purpose of an internal evaluation of products and services to determine the degree of fitness in meeting internal requirements of each of the above solutions within the DOC current computing environment. Quoters are free to propose one or more than one of the three product solutions however; the Government anticipates it will continue to exercise additional orders and options with one solution provider for one product solution. Note, the Department of Commerce further reserves the right not to make any award if that action is in its best interest after concluding the review of the quotes, and is subject to availability of appropriate funding. All interested LAR Quoters shall provide a quote for the following line items: BASE PERIOD-Effective Date of Award through twelve (12) Months Thereafter: Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 0001-Global Enterprise Licenses (Client and Server) Agreement for electronic communications and messaging software product and associated services CLIN 0002-Maintenance of product and technical support; CLIN 0003-Support for Installation/Testing of Software for ten (10) consecutive business days; OPTION PERIOD I-13th Month through 24th Month: CLIN 0004-Global Enterprise Licenses (Client and Server) Agreement for electronic communications and messaging software product and associated services CLIN 0005-Maintenance of product and technical support; OPTION PERIOD II-25th Month through 36th Month: CLIN 0006-Global Enterprise Licenses (Client and Server) Agreement for electronic communications and messaging software product and associated services; CLIN 0007-Maintenance of product and technical support; OPTION PERIOD III-37th Month through 48th Month: CLIN 0008-Global Enterprise Licenses (Client and Server) Agreement for electronic communications and messaging software product and associated services, CLIN 0009-Maintenance of product and technical support; OPTION PERIOD IV-49th Month through 60th Month: CLIN 0010-Global Enterprise Licenses (Client and Server) Agreement for electronic communications and messaging software product and associated services; CLIN 0011-Maintenance of product and technical support. During the period specified in the ORDERING clause (FAR 52.216-18), the government shall place orders totaling a minimum of 10 client seats and a maximum 50,000 client seats and appropriate number of  server licenses and assurances for the Department of Commerce.

The Contractor will be required to perform the work in CLIN 0003 at a location designated by the Department of Commerce within the Washington D.C. Metro area.

FAR 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition, provides in part: The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror initial proposal should contain the offeror best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. See FAR 52.215-1(4)(f). The full text of FAR 52.215-1 is incorporated by reference.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/


INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this contract is to fund and employ a Program Manager for Monitoring and Evaluation (Program Manager for M&E) in DCHA/OTI Washington to provide direct support to OTI country programs.  The M&E Program Manager will be supervised by the OTI Program Office Team Leader.  The M&E Program Manager assist OTI's country program teams in applying OTI methodologies and approach, including rolling assessments and performance review, implementation and monitoring of activities, and evaluation of program impact, in order to improve and strengthen ongoing country program activities.  OTI estimates that 75% of the workload will be in direct support of program implementation, and 25% of the workload will be in support of strategy and evaluation of program impact.

Specifically, the Program Manager will work with OTI country programs to capture country project and program level implementation information. This information will directly contribute to program analysis and reporting.  The captured information will also help better define implementation of program activities.  Working with country teams and the Program Office, the Program Manager will be responsible for assisting country teams in conducting and facilitating rolling assessments, final evaluations, and after exit reviews.  A key tool in these efforts will be the effective use of OTI's country program database. The Program Manager will consult with OTI country program staff on the continued refinement and implementation of the OTI Country Program Performance Review, a process that is designed to monitor and document program and country-level impact of OTI activities.  The position may require up to 20% travel time.

The initial grade level of this position will be the equivalent of GS-12.  The actual salary of the successful candidate will be negotiated within the pay range depending on qualifications, previous relevant experience and work history, salary and educational background. Salaries above the maximum of the pay grade will not be considered.

Following two (2) years at the GS-12 equivalent grade, the candidate will have the opportunity for advancement to a GS-13 equivalent grade based the recommendation of the supervisor. This recommendation will be based on performance and availability of funds.  Neither advancement nor extension of the contract is guaranteed.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this position is to enhance the M&E functional capacity of OTI country programs and the Program Office.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Program Manager must be an individual with sound judgment, excellent writing and communication skills and a well-developed understanding of U.S. foreign policy interests and the role transition programming can play in the mitigation of conflict and the development of democracy.  Ideally, the Program Manager will have experience working on transition, fragile states, or post-conflict programs that are similar to those that OTI implements.  The Program Manager will also have experience in assessment, design, monitoring and evaluation of activities and programs implemented in the transitional environments in which OTI works.

The successful candidate must be able to accomplish a wide range of assignments on short notice. Since work often involves evolving program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual must be someone who is highly flexible and able to work on multiple tasks simultaneously. S/he must be able to work effectively and productively as a member of a team.

The specific duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

A.	GS-12 EQUIVALENT

This includes Washington-based and field-based support to OTI and implementing partner staff.
* Develop processes to better incorporate program impact findings into current program implementation.
* Assist in the development, refinement, and presentation of the M&E portions of country program startup conferences, retreats, and other ongoing implementation trainings for OTI USPSC, FNPSC and partner staff, in collaboration with OTI training and technical staff.
* Assist in managing the OTI e-Room and other communication tools to facilitate exchange of Implementation and Impact information, results, best practices, and guidance between OTI Washington, OTI Field staff, and OTI Partner staff.
* Assist in the field reviews of OTI country programs as part of the Program Performance Review (PPR) process; draft PPR documents as needed; and track country team compliance with the PPR decisions.
* Review OTI country team reports, including quarterly reports, and make recommendations on how to improve reporting to capture impact information, and how to integrate reports into other rolling assessment processes.
* Update documentation of existing systems and best practices regarding the collection, documentation, and distribution of project- and program-level impact information;
* Assist in managing the documentation, improvement, and refinement of OTI processes for conducting initial program assessments, monitoring and rolling assessment systems, and other evaluation products, including developing written guidance for country teams and evaluators.
* Perform other duties as assigned.

B.	GS-13 EQUIVALENT 

As noted above, the incumbent will have the opportunity for advancement to a GS-13 equivalent grade following 24 months at the GS-12 equivalent grade, based the recommendation of the supervisor.

* Provide support to country teams to improve systems of gathering project- and program-level rolling impact data. This includes Washington-based and field-based support to OTI and implementing partner staff.
* Assist in the development, refinement, and presentation of the M&E portions of country program startup conferences, retreats, and other trainings for OTI USPSC, FNPSC and partner staff, in collaboration with OTI training and technical staff.
* Assist in the field reviews of OTI country programs as part of the Program Performance Review (PPR) process; serve as a PPR Board Member; draft PPR documents as needed; and track country team compliance with the PPR decisions.
* Manage the documentation, improvement, and refinement of OTI processes for conducting initial program assessments, monitoring and rolling assessment systems, final program evaluations, and after exit reviews, including developing written guidance for country teams and evaluators.
* Work with the OTI Training unit to train country teams (including implementing partners) in the development and use of OTI's indicators under the new Framework for Foreign Assistance, including the Foreign Assistance Coordination Tracking System (FACTS);
* Review OTI country team reports, including quarterly reports, and make recommendations on how to improve reporting to capture impact information, and how to integrate reports into other rolling assessment processes.
* Advise OTI Program Office staff on refinement of the Program Performance Review (PPR) process.
* Serve as CTO for Task Orders for M&E services, ensuring OTI's requirements are met.
Note that the difference between the GS-12 and GS-13 levels is the degree of independence exhibited by the incumbent in performing the required duties and responsibilities outlined in this scope of work (SOW).

(Determines basic eligibility for the position.  Applicants who do not meet all of the selection factors are considered NOT qualified for the position.)
* Applicant is a U.S. Citizen;
* Complete and hand-signed federal form OF-612 submitted;
* Supplemental document specifically addressing the Evaluation Factors submitted;
* Ability to obtain a SECRET level security clearance;

EVALUATION FACTORS
(Used to determine the competitive ranking of qualified applicants in comparison to other applicants.  The factors are listed in priority order from highest to least.)

Factor #1	Applicant must provide a response no longer than one page in length to the following questions for the country program example below:

i. What simple indicators and tools can be used for measuring program- and activity-level impacts in the below country program example?
ii. What tools may be applied towards developing an operational framework to guide program decision-making on the program objectives and taking periodic "snapshots" of important program components?

In July 2006, OTI launched a new program in Country X which will soon elect national leadership to replace an interim government following a decade of civil war.? This new initiative is part of the U.S. Government's effort to support Country X in a successful political transition and help consolidate peace after 10 years of civil war. The broad goals of the program are to reinforce Country X's conflict mitigation capacity, advance inclusiveness in the political process, and engage youth in constructive, non-violent activity. Over the next 24 months, the program will provide strategically targeted support to activities that help the new Government of X (GOX) gain traction and consolidate legitimacy as it undertakes the formidable challenges of national transformation. 

The program's main objectives are to: (1) improve capacity of key GOX ministries and offices in areas including effective planning, budgeting, communication and coordination with relevant counterparts; and (2) assist the GOX and other key actors to mount effective responses to high visibility issues that are linked to the peace and recovery process. The program will accomplish these objectives by providing: short-term technical assistance to priority GOX ministries and offices; small grant activities that will reinforce this technical assistance; assistance to civil society organizations and media outlets for public information campaigns; and other programming to promote the stability essential for a fragile state to stay on the path towards peace and recovery. 

OTI wants to assess the achievements and challenges of the program over the course of the next 24 months.  OTI also wants to enhance program management by improved decision-making processes for program strategy adjustments and assessing activity-level impact.  These efforts will help the program to prioritize initiatives, identify critical partners, and assess impact of activities, without impeding the rapid response and flexibility that is critical to OTI country programming.   


Factor #2	Demonstrated professional experience in the evaluation of project activities relevant to political transition and/or post-conflict programs.

Factor #3	Demonstrated oral and written communication skills, and analytical skills illustrated through the research, preparation and presentation of status reports, briefing papers, and other official documents.

Factor #4	Demonstrated social and interpersonal skills illustrated by the ability to interact in a team setting, or with counterparts, on both the lowest and highest political, social, and economic levels.

Factor #5	Demonstrated ability to initiate, develop and manage multiple projects simultaneously in a high visibility, high-pressure environment, including crisis situations.

PART I, PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT FOR TEXTUAL RECORDS DIGITATION ENVIRONMENT 1.0  INTRODUCTION The objective of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) is to obtain all equipment and labor necessary to procure operational new workstations that will provide an expanded capability for the digitization/scanning of textual records at Archives II in College Park Maryland.  The workstations include the accompanying server/software and data deliverables and maintenance of the workstations for a base year with two possible option years described in this statement of work, along with industry standard warranties for the equipment and system.  Existing work stations as described below will also be required to integrate with the new workstations. Statement of Need, Background and Objectives: The Special Media Preservation Laboratory (NWTS) of Preservation Programs (NWT) of the National Archives and Records Administration needs to expand capabilities for the digitization/scanning of textual records. Currently, the Microfilm Camera Lab of the Special Media Preservation Laboratory operates sixteen (16) traditional planetary-style 35mm microfilm cameras. We anticipate replacing these microfilm cameras over a period of several years with new digital camera systems with indexing software to be used for digitizing a variety of original records. The NWTS labs operate two microfilm scanners (an older roll-film scanner and a newer microfiche scanner) and needs to expand microfilm scanning capabilities. Also, the labs use several high-speed document scanners. All these systems need to be integrated into an environment for digitizing and indexing textual records using a software application for workflow management and document indexing. The existing Special Media Preservation (NWTS) Environment. The NWTS Labs are creating a local area network (LAN) which is comprised of lab equipment (scanners, digital cameras, printers, audio and video capture and playback devices) and the computers used to host the applications that run these devices, as well as the digital storage systems to hold the digital output and servers that manage this entire array of devices. Each lab (audio and video, still photo/digital imaging/aerial/cartographic, motion picture, microfilm camera, and microfilm duplication) has workstations used to capture and prepare digital output from the reformatting devices. The digital resources are saved to a local network attached storage (NAS) server (typically 6 TB to 7 TB of RAID-5 storage with tape back-up and an uninterruptible power supply) that is dedicated to each lab for short-term storage. Digital resources saved to the NAS servers are backed up daily to LTO tapes by project, and copies of the tapes are transferred to protected storage for the duration of the project. Quality control checks are made by technicians during the course of a project and at its completion.  Once approved, the project resources (digital files and related metadata) will be transferred to a centralized storage area network (SAN) managed by NARAs IT department. Daily LTO backups are made of data stored on the SAN. Due to the necessity of choosing workstations and operating systems based upon lab equipment and application needs, servers running Active Directory (Microsoft) and Open Directory (Apple Computing) are used simultaneously to manage the lab network environment. Managed Gigabit switches are used at the workgroup level to provide adequate network throughput between the workstations and local network attachable storage, as well as part of LAN security. Fiber based switches are used to connect the workgroup switches and network attachable storage, as well as providing a link to the centralized SAN. All the equipment and software procured for the textual records digitization environment will be integrated into the NWTS lab environment. Other existing equipment to be used in this environment with the workflow management and document indexing software include-Zeutschel OS 10000TT book scanner-Fujitsu fi-4750c document scanner-Kodak i620 and i1320 document scanners-Sunrise Proscan 2000 microfilm scanner -Wicks & Wilson FS300 microfiche scanner-Various photograph digitizing workstations - Workstations for existing equipment are various Windows based computers.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-17.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all interested quoters may submit a quote.

This is a brand name or equal requirement. Brand name or equal description is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive and is to indicate the quality and characteristic of products that will be considered satisfactory to meet the agency?s requirement.

Sollar Slit to be used as a Parallel Beam Analyzer in X-ray Powder Diffraction

The NIST Ceramics Division is commissioning a new facility in AML dedicated to certification of NIST Standard Reference Material (SRM) for diffraction from nanometer length scale features in powders and thin films.  While the certification of thin film SRMs is only presently being realized, powder diffraction standards have been available for 30 years; their sales amount to approximately 700 units/year.  The facility in AML includes three primary pieces of diffraction equipment largely built in house by the NIST Ceramics Division.  The Ceramics Division Parallel Beam Diffractometer, CDPBD, is the machine built to perform SI traceable measurements of lattice parameter on single crystals (thin films) and powders.  While the X-ray optics used for measurements on the two sample formats differ substantially, they both result in a parallel X-ray beam.  This parallel beam is requisite to the performance of SI traceable measurements.  The optics used for powders results in a beam that is parallel to within 0.06 to 0.08 degrees.  The diffracted beam must be ?analyzed? to exclude radiation not scattered at the measured angle.  Therefore, an analyzer with an acceptance angle 0.06 to 0.08 degrees is required.  A solar slit collimator is the appropriate X-ray optic to use in this application as the analyzer.   

Sollar slit collimators consist of a series of parallel flats arranged in a layered array with a constant spacing between them.  The flats serve to obstruct radiation striking them, thus, the device will obstruct all radiation except that of a specific angular range which is dependent on the spacing between the foils and the length of collimator itself.  The angular range that the collimator transmits can be characterized as the full-width-half maximum, FWHM of the X-ray peak that is collected as the collimator is rotated through an X-ray beam.  In an ideal case, this measured value can be related to the aforementioned spacing thickness and overall length of the collimator.  Two factors define the quality of the collimator at a given FWHM, the form of the transmitted profile and the efficiency of the collimator. The first factor is largely dependent on the scattering of the X-ray from the surface of the flats which will impart artifacts to the diffraction profiles.  These artifacts will, in tern, comprise the quality of the NIST SRMs which are certified from data collected utilizing such equipment.  The second factor, the efficiency, is related to the ratio of the thickness of the flats to their spacing as well as their degree of flatness.  These two factors lead to the ?loss? of the optic, or the quanta X-rays scattered within the specified angular range, but are nonetheless, not transmitted by the Sollar slit.  The efficiency is also a critical factor as the precision of the measurements is specific to the total X-ray quanta that can be collected.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has a requirement for Bede Scientific Inc. RX Soller 075, or equivalent, meeting all of the following required salient characteristics.

Entrance Aperture: 10 x 15 mm, the larger dimension is parallel to the surface of the flats;

<CONTACT>Michael Knowles, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-482-6437, Fax 202-501-8122, Email mknowles@doc.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is (1) to provide the Government answers to questions received in response to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation No. CM1301-7-RQ-0005 and (2) to change the Small Business Size Standard from 100 to 500 employees.

(1) Questions and Answers: 

Question No. 1:  Based on the scale of this solicitation, can you extend the response deadline of January 9, 2007. 

DOC Response:  The response deadline of January 9, 2007 has been changed to read January 12, 2007, at 12:00 pm (noon).  Amendment No. 1, to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation Notice, was posted 12/20/ 2006.

Question No. 2:  Information required for resellers to respond to this requirement is being gathered; can the due date to the solicitation be extended to January 16, 2007?

DOC Response:  See response to Question No. 1 above.  

Question No. 3a:  Please provide clarification on CLIN 0003?  Is this for 10 days or for 1 year?   CLIN 0003-Support for Installation/Testing of Software for ten (10) consecutive business days. 

DOC Response:  CLIN 0003 - Support for Installation/Testing of Software for ten (10) consecutive Business days is part of the BASE PERIOD.   There is no repeat of this CLIN in the OPTION PERIODs.   

Question No. 3b:  According to the solicitation, the Government intends to conduct a ten (10) day technical evaluation.  What is the scope and of the 10 day evaluation for installation/testing?  When will Government provide the success criteria or additional detail on the tasks to be performed in this evaluation?  This will better enable offerors to ensure that the most appropriate resources are on hand to support the optimal level of success and evaluation of its proposed electronic communications and messaging solutions. 

DOC Response:  The scope of effort for the resellers will be limited to installation and configuration of the software on Government Furnished Equipment, and user support.  The requirements are an internal document and will not be published to the offerors.

Question No. 4:  Concerning this initiative and the incumbent currently providing work to this.  Is it possible to get a list of all or some of these providers? 

DOC Response:  Each bureau within DOC may have one or many contracts for their messaging licenses and maintenance.  Some bureaus (or some of the organizations within a bureau) may be on an enterprise contract.  At this time there is no central repository of information that has information on who are the service providers and/or who they provide service for.  In any event, that data is unnecessary to respond to this requirement for licenses.

Question No. 5:  Will there be a second procurement for integration services for the selected email solution following this one for SW licenses?  If so at what point is this procurement expected? 

DOC Response:  Until there has been a selection of the product, DOC will not be able to determine if there will be a second procurement.

Question No. 6:  What mechanism will the government use for the procurement of hardware infrastructure for the deployment of the consolidated email solution?

DOC Response:  See response to Question 5 above.

Question No. 7a:  The solicitation specifies the submission of past experience and past performance.  Does the Department of Commerce (Government) require this information from the product vendor or the [small business] reseller?  

DOC Response: The Government requires that information be submitted from the small business reseller.  Past Experience:  Quoters shall provide three (3) references for which the Quoter has provided products and services similar in size and scope to those under this Quotation.  The Quoter shall include the company/agency name, Point of contact, telephone number; fax number and e-mail address.  Past Performance:  Quoters shall provide at least three projects within the last 3 years that display the Quoters past performance with procurements of similar size and scope to those under this requirement, as an authorized software provider.

Question No. 7b:  The evaluation criteria in the solicitation appear to intend that the reseller (Quoter) provide its past experience and past performance for similar scope of procurements that are not necessarily the same technology as that planned for acquisition under this contract.  Please clarify.  

DOC Response:  Resellers are to provide past experience and past performance for procurements of similar scope.  These may be different acquisitions but they must be of 
similar scope and nature to the requirements under this acquisition.

Question No. 8:  According to the solicitation, the Government intends to conduct a ten (10) day technical evaluation.  What is the scope of the 10 day evaluation for installation/testing?  When will Government provide the success criteria or additional detail on the tasks to be performed in this evaluation?  This will better enable offerors to ensure that the most appropriate resources are on hand to support the optimal level of success and evaluation of its proposed electronic communications and messaging solutions.

DOC Response:  The Government intends to evaluate each product for compatibility with DOC current infrastructure across its bureaus.  This testing is internal to DOC, and does not impact upon submissions under this combined synopsis solicitation.  The Government intends to fulfill its minimum ordering requirements, as stated in this RFQ.  

Question No. 9:  When will the Government provide additional details for the messaging requirements (i.e., functional capabilities evaluated under the solicitation)?

DOC Response:  This procurement is for a maximum requirement for 50,000 licenses. The software product must contain a fully integrated desktop client and product suite which includes:  email, calendar, task, contact, instant messaging, global address, web access, and directory services (if required). The size of the mailboxes and further similar details are immaterial for purposes of this combined synopsis/solicitation. 

Question No. 10:  The solicitation does not appear to specify any specific platforms and/or desktop requirements.  This vendor understands that there are a number of platforms currently supported within the DOC (e.g., Windows, Linux and versions of UNIX, etc.).  Does the Government require the proposed electronic communication and messaging solution be able to support all the platforms specified above?  How does the Government intend to evaluate Quoters proposed product solutions in regards to scope of platform support for DOC systems? 

DOC Response:  The expectations are that the software will perform on all current, stable, in production, releases of the existing operating systems within the DOC for both desktop/web and server environments

Question No. 11:  According to the solicitation there are a number of messaging systems used within Commerce to date. Is there a desktop requirement for thick vs. thin client?  Does the Government intend to evaluate Quoters proposed product solutions in regards to its type of client support as part of this solicitation?

DOC Response:  The software must perform in both thick and thin desktop environments.

Question No. 12:  In the requirement to support instant messaging capabilities, does the Government require any of the following related capabilities that provide value to the end user community: Ability to securely access to public Instant messaging; Ability to securely store and log instant messaging and/or chat history?  Will any of these capabilities be factored in to the evaluation criteria for this solicitation?

DOC Response:  Public instant messaging ? No  Ability to securely store and log history - No

Question No. 13:  As part of the evaluation of the proposed vendor product solutions, does the Government intend to take into consideration additional desktop software dependencies of the vendors proposed software in its cost evaluation?  That is, if a vendors messaging solution has dependencies on specific versions of additional required programs or other software programs running simultaneously on a DOC end users desktop, will the deployment and/or upgrade of those other programs be evaluated as a cost consideration for that vendor solution?

DOC Response:   Yes, the Government does intend to take into consideration the cost for additional software or products to perform the requirements stated for a fully integrated desk top client and product suite which includes email, calendar, task, contacts, instant messaging, global address, web access, and directory services (if required) however; desktop upgrades are outside the scope of this effort.

Question No. 14:  There are nine LARs who are able to sell to the public sector. We are unaware of any other LAR that meets the NAICS 423430 criteria. Please consider removing the NAICS 423430 criteria and simply specifying small business instead.

DOC Response:  DOC has determined that given the size and complexity of this Department wide requirement that DOC needs can only be satisfactorily met by a resellers that has been currently qualified by GSA and is on the GSA Schedule 70, Information Technology (IT) Schedule, Special Item (SIN) 132-33, Perpetual Software Licensees.  

Question No. 15:  The Combined Synopsis/Solicitation No. CM1301-7-RQ-0005 states that the corresponding NAICS code of 423430 with associated small business standard of 100 employees.  When reviewing the SBA web site for government procurement, it appears to state that "The non-manufacturer size standard of 500 employees shall be used for purposes of Government procurement of supplies".  It is difficult to tell exactly where this statement applies but appears to apply to most IT procurements.  Does this statement on the SBA site allow a small business to be defined as 500 employees or less for your procurement?

DOC Response:  DOC will issue an Amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation changing the small business definition from 100 employees to 500 employees.

Question No. 16:  My company is an IBM Lotus Partner and we meet the small business set aside requirements for solicitation CM1301-7-RQ-0005.  I noticed the solicitation references Large Account Reseller (LAR) on several occasions.  This terminology is specific to the Microsoft federal reseller program.  We are an IBM Lotus partner we are not a member of the Microsoft LAR program.  We would like to respond with the IBM Lotus solution.
 
Are we precluded from responding since we are not a Microsoft LAR? 

DOC Response:  Your company is not precluded from responding to this combined synopsis/solicitation. 

Question No. 17:  This vendor understands that there are a number of agencies within Commerce who support have high-availability / messaging server clustering within their current messaging solutions. Does the Government require the proposed electronic communication and messaging solution be able to support clustering of the messaging server/high availability?  How does the Government intend to evaluate proposed product solutions in regards to server clustering and high availability? 

DOC Response:  We expect the solution to be highly available.  

Question No. 18:  For this requirement CM13017RQ0005 is there an incumbent.  If so, please provide the following information: contractors name, contract number, date, expiration date and value.

DOC Response:  This is a new procurement and there is no incumbent.

(2) The NAICS code is 423430 and the associated small business size standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>This was a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Only those Large Account Resellers (LAR) under GSA Schedule 70, Information Technology (IT) Schedule, Special Item Number (SIN) 132-33, Perpetual Software Licensees will be considered for award.

The Department of Commerce (DOC) has reviewed all proposals submitted in response to the above-referenced solicitation.  DOC has determined that, due to the lack of adequate competition, it is in the best interest of the government not to make any awards under this combined solicitation/synopsis and therefore, Solicitation Number CM1301-7-RQ-0005 is cancelled.  DOC does not anticipate that a new requirement will be synopsized.

FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0.

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).


ATTACHMENT 4 - AAPD-06-12 - HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.
