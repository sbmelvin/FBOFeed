<SOLNBR>NHLBI-HV-11-16
<RESPDATE>120509
<CONTACT>Jeffrey A Williams, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 435-0331, Fax (301) 480-3338, Email williamsja2@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquistions (OA), will be seeking proposals from qualified Offerors with the ability to serve as a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and capable of maintaining, managing, and augmenting the Interagency Registry in support of the INTERMACS program. Project Background The NHLBI is interested in renewing the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) program contract for a data coordinating center to manage a registry of advanced heart failure patients receiving FDA-approved, durable, mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSDs). INTERMACS is a national registry created to advance the understanding and application of mechanical circulatory support in order to improve the mortality, morbidity, and quality of life of patients with advanced heart failure. It is a collaboration among NHLBI, FDA, CMS, clinicians, scientists, and industry. To date there are 100 centers participating and over 2000 patients enrolled in the registry. As many as 600,000 patients in the US have advanced heart failure, and the numbers are growing. Therapeutic approaches have changed little over the last few years and include: drugs, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and pacemakers. Patients whose heart failure progresses to later stages of heart failure have options limited to medical management, transplantation or mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) therapy. INTERMACS data serve to facilitate the refinement of patient selections to enhance clinical management with current devices, and guide and expedite clinical trials for new indications and/or new devices. Purpose and Objectives The goal of the proposed program is to continue and expand data collection of advanced heart failure patients receiving mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSD). This will provide detailed data on advanced heart failure patients treated with FDA-approved, durable MCSD devices throughout the United States. All patients receiving MCSDs at INTERMACS certified sites are entered into the registry database. Information on patient demographics, clinical and laboratory parameters, outcome measures, hospital and device performance, as well as blood and tissue samples are collected and stored. The program is supported by an INTERMACS Data Coordinating Center. Project Requirements 1. Implement a collaboration plan, such as but not limited to a Public, Private Partnership that integrates Industry and other non-NHLBI collaboration and financial support for the INTERMACS enterprise on an increasing scale so that at the end of five years the NHLBI financial contribution to maintain the registry would be significantly reduced. The plan should provide for: a. the maintenance of data quality and completeness, data access, and the rigor and objectivity of the database and registry policies and procedures. b. an external advisory board to advise on integration of Industry involvement in the Registry and long-term sustainability plans. 2. Maintain and manage the INTERMACS Registry by serving as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC). This will require the following: a. Continue data collection on current INTERMACS patients at certified clinical sites until death or transplantation (whichever occurs first), and collect data on new patients receiving FDA-approved MCSDs at certified clinical centers. b. As part of the data collection activities described above in &ldquo;a,&rdquo; the DCC shall maintain a computer system and website and associated plans and documentation as described below: i. Develop and maintain a computer system, secure database, and software needed for the collection, storage, and analysis of all registry data (including biological specimens) collected from all clinical sites. Provide computer backup systems in the event of a primary system failure. Maintain documentation of the data variables, data ranges and assure appropriate confidentiality and security of all computer files. ii. Develop and maintain a registry web site for the distribution of INTERMACS information, documents, and forms to the clinical sites and investigators. Develop and maintain a secure web-based entry system for clinical sites to use. All web pages designed under this contract shall meet the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (<a href="http://www.accessboard.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm#Back">http://www.accessboard.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm#Back</a>) iii. Develop and execute plans and procedures to make data, associated data collection software, web site information, and associated documentation transportable for future government use. iv. Submit an Information Systems Security Plan as required by the NHLBI. c. As required under human subjects protection regulations, revise DCC regulatory documents including the registry protocol and Informed Consents to reflect "INTERMACS" as the recipient of Protected Health Information and obtain approval through the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB). Supply new IRB-approved regulatory documents to the participating clinical sites and oversee revision and submission of site regulatory packages through the site IRBs. Document this process and assure that all sites have complied and all Informed Consents contain the required Federal elements. After regulatory approvals are received, oversee the identification, contacting and reconsenting of existing INTERMACS patients and new enrolling patients.
