<DESC>Description:  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to award a competitive requirement to the Microsoft Corporation or any authorized Microsoft reseller (as certified by the Microsoft Corporation) of "both"  the required Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS) and Microsoft Premier Support Services (Premiere).  Reclamation may add several other Department of Interior agency requirements.  The estimated period of performance is a base period (12 months) with up to a maximum of two, follow-on option periods.  The Government requires ongoing information technology (IT) solution development support from Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS) and IT operating environment support from Microsoft Premier Support services (Premiere) for assistance in developing and maintaining IT system components that make agency wide use of proprietary Microsoft products.  The Microsoft Corporation, to the best of the Government's knowledge, has limited the number of authorized resellers or business firms.  Any authorized reseller of both services will be required to team with in-house Microsoft Corporation personnel since the Microsoft Corporation does not allow "direct" access to Microsoft in-house development and product teams due to source code and other proprietary considerations.  The Microsoft Corporation has in-house development teams for each product or software line.  This equates to unique benefits to users of Microsoft products. Reclamation requires access to new Microsoft product information, research data on existing products, hot-fixes, and other critical in-house IT assistance that will enable Reclamation to configure products to function at optimal efficiency, to minimize downtime or inoperability of Microsoft products and technologies, and to plan for future hardware and software requirements since Reclamation will have access to pre-release product information.      Any authorized reseller or pass-through dealer of  "both"  the Microsoft Premiere Support Services and the Microsoft Consulting Services that believes it can execute the full range of required services shall submit its request for the copy of the solicitation directly to the Contracting Officer.  Any reseller or contractor request shall be accompanied by a Microsoft certification of reseller status of both the Microsoft Premiere Support Services and the Microsoft Consulting Services.  All contractors requesting a copy within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be forwarded a copy of the solicitation.  Inquiries will only be accepted by Fax at (303) 445-6345, Attention: Ann R. Manning.  Responses should include the firm's business size [e.g. small business, other than small business] in accordance with the size standard: $23 Million for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541519.

CDRs of low quality and CDRs that have been stored/shipped improperly cause the autoloader to jam resulting in a high rate of failure. CDRs that stick together cannot be fed through the autoloader. CDRs that do not feed through the autoloader cannot be used. The label surface of the CDR must be blank and capable of accepting a direct print from a Thermal Printer. CDRs that cannot be directly thermal printed by both the Teac P55 and the Rimage Prism thermal printers, such as those manufactured for use with InkJet printers, cannot be used.

<DESC>Purpose & Need:   The purpose of this project is to suppress current infestations of the Neptyia junetae , and prevent the spread from NFS lands onto both Village property and private property adjacent to the Village of Cloudcroft NM.  
Proposed Action:  In order to prevent further defoliation in currently infested and adjacent stands, the Lincoln National Forest proposes to treat a portion of the affected National Forest System lands adjacent to private property in the vicinity of Cloudcroft, New Mexico.  The total acreage within the project area is approximately 5000 acres. Based on research and consultation with regional entomologists and pesticide applicators, the preferred control agent has been determined to be Bacillus thuringiensis var.kurstaki (Btk), a naturally occurring bacterium.

Application would be done from the air and could begin as early as late fall, 2007.  This time period coincides with the active feeding period of the Nepytia caterpillars but would be after the Sacramento Mountain checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas anicia cloudcrofti) has entered its diapause, or dormant phase.  If post suppression monitoring determines that the fall application is not successful in reducing the Nepytia population, a second application would be conducted in the spring of 2008, while the Nepytia caterpillars are still active, but before the checkerspot butterfly emerges from its dormancy.  A pre-application survey of the checkerspot butterflies will be conducted prior to spraying to determine their activity level.

<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) has a need to develop and demonstrate technologies to detect/locate, access, diagnose/identify, render safe/neutralize, and dispose of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and unexploded ordnance (UXO).  White papers/full proposals for exploratory development are sought in the following four technology areas.  1.  DETECTION / LOCATION:  a. Infrared Sensor Detection and Defeat - This effort is to develop or improve technology to detect, neutralize, or defeat passive and/or active infrared (PIR and AIR) devices.  These PIR and AIR devices can potentially be used in improvised explosive devices and therefore present an EOD hazard.  b. Explosives Detection at Range - This effort is to develop or improve detection of concealed explosives (e.g. vehicle, building, etc.) from a distance.  The detection / safe distance will vary depending upon the amount and type of explosive.  c. Explosives Detection - Th!  is effort is to explore the usefulness of X-ray fluorescence for detecting explosives in various containers and vehicles.  2.  ACCESS:  a. Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) Perception Sensors - This effort is to develop or improve autonomous operations of UGVs by evaluating the use of small, power efficient sensors for perception; as well as robust techniques for processing the data returned from these sensors.  Examples of commonly used sensors include stereo vision systems, LADAR/LIDAR, acoustic sensors, GPS, and radar.  b. EOD Robot Communication Systems - This effort is to develop or improve the use of the RF spectrum in EOD UGVs.  This effort shall include the development of a radio system for EOD UGVs that is capable of operating in harsh RF environments, is resistant to jamming, provides C2 and video over distances of at least 1200m line-of-sight (uninterrupted), and 600m non-line-of-sight, and has frequency flexibility to enable automatic or manual changes in the transm!  ission frequency as dictated by mission requirements.  The radio syste m should be designed to support internet protocol connectivity to enable net-centric operations and the sharing of data.  c. Light Hydrocarbon Fuel Cells - This effort is to miniaturize fuel cell technology for use in a variety of EOD equipment.  This effort could focus on using light hydrocarbon technology, such as propane.  3.  DIAGNOSTICS / IDENTIFICATION:  a. Radiographic Capabilities - This effort is to develop and/or improve radiographic technology by identifying a generator and imager combination that can generate 3-dimensional images through steel, while keeping the size down for one man portability.  This technology should provide the capability to shoot multiple imaging plates simultaneously without image distortion.  In addition, this technology should provide the capability to identify the filler (e.g. industrial chemicals, explosive types, etc.), distinguish organic/inorganic materials, and provide automatic component identification (e.g. diodes, resistors, swit!  ches, etc).  b. Fuze State - This effort is to develop or improve the Electronically Safed and Armed Fuze (ESAF) devices to remotely provide fuze status (armed / unarmed) to the EOD technician.  4.   UNDERWATER:  a. Autonomous Underwater Explosives Neutralization -  This effort is to develop or improve technologies that are suitable for integration into an unmanned underwater system to autonomously neutralize limpet mines and other explosive devices that may be placed on or near a ship hull or on pier and piling structures near ship berths.  This technology shall include the ability to maintain correct positioning for effective neutralization of threat objects for a prolonged period of time.  b. Low Collateral Damage Neutralization - This effort is to develop or improve neutralization techniques compatible with diver- and/or unmanned vehicle-placed systems to mitigate damage to ships hulls, underwater piers/pilings and underwater structures during neutralization of attached!   limpet mines and/or improvised explosive devices that are attached to , or in close proximity to their target.  c. Non-Imaging Underwater Sensors - This effort is to develop or improve non-imaging underwater sensors to include, but is not limited to: chemical detection explosives; internal explosives, radiological or other material/component identification; magnetic signature recognition; This technology shall include sensors that augment the current imaging sensors to increase the stand-off detection, classification, identification and localization capabilities of manned and unmanned underwater systems.  d. Autonomous Close-in Threat Object Inspection - This effort is to develop improved autonomy in unmanned underwater systems containing multiple sensors to enable adaptive, precision maneuvers relative to previously localized threat objects in a manner which optimizes sensor(s) performance against threat objects.  Integral autonomy enhancements are intended to enhance threat object and feature identification capabilities, and enable precision!   placement of neutralizers.  e. Detection / Location of Submerged UXO - This effort is to develop or improve detection, classification and localization of both ferrous and nonferrous UXO submerged in salt or fresh water and potentially covered by mud and silt.  This technology shall be transported by a single person or possibly integrated into unmanned vehicles during localized underwater searches.  WHITE PAPERS: Interested Offerors are requested to submit a white paper, the purpose of which is to preclude unwarranted effort by the offeror in preparing a full technical and cost proposal that would not be considered responsive to requirements.  Each white paper is limited to five pages in length and may address only one of the technology areas defined above.  The white paper shall consist of three primary sections: Technical, Management, and Cost.  The Technical section shall state which category is being addressed and shall consist of clear descriptions of objectives, techn!  ical issues which must be resolved to accomplish objectives, approach  to resolving these issues, and particular prior experience of the Offeror in the targeted technology area.  The Management section shall include key personnel (include curriculum vitae), experience, facilities and a plan of action with milestones.  The Cost section shall include a cost breakdown of the effort being proposed.  The period of performance shall not exceed three (3) years in length and the total cost shall not exceed $1,500,000.  White papers shall be submitted not later than 3:00 PM (EDT) on 22 August 2007.  It is anticipated that the evaluation of the white papers will be completed and the results disseminated to Offerors by 21 September 2007.  FULL PROPOSALS:  The Government will request full proposals based on the merits of the white papers received.  Full proposals will not be limited as to the number of pages and shall consist of three sections, Technical, Management, and Cost.  All sections shall reference the BAA number and include the Offeror's project t!  itle.  Unique titles given to the white papers/proposals should address the technology area that is being proposed.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award a sole source purchase order to Image Delivery System, LLC (IDS) to produce electronic files of vintage FHWA historical photos.  IDS will transfer photo hard copies electronically to CD format.  IDS will use an electronic program that they developed for FHWA.  Because of storage issues it is necessary to transfer these photos to CD format.  There is great historical value in the electronic acquisition of vintage black and white photos.  Because IDS developed this program for FHWA and are the only providers of the program, no other source can provide the required services.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is on or about July 25, 2007.

(HP) to provide HelpDesk tools; maintenance/support and network maintenance, for use in the performance of order HHSF223200650532G with HP for the ORA Consolidated Application HelpDesk (ORCAHD).  As the ORCAHD services are listed on HP?s GSA schedule contract, and the HelpDesk tools are not, it is necessary to purchase them open-market.  The HelpDesk tools are necessary to support HP?s proprietary systems and processes under the HelpDesk order and, therefore, HP is the only source who can satisfy FDA?s requirements for the Helpdesk tools.  The HelpDesk tools will be reflected on the order under Other Direct Costs (ODCs).
The period of performance for this requirement is four (4) years, February 1, 2007 through January 31, 2011.  The base year for the ORCAHD order and the Helpdesk tools ODCs was February 1, 2006 through January 31, 2007, and the Option Year 1 order for ORCAHD order has been executed. 
This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.  The NAICS code is 541511.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations and no solicitation document is available. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give a written response within five (5) calendar days from the date of this published announcement. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information can be sent to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Acquisitions & Grants Services, Attn: Michael McGrath, 5630 Fishers Lane HFA-500, Rockville, MD 20857. Information may also be faxed to (301) 827-7039. Responses received will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the FDA will proceed with the sole source award to the Hewlett-Packard Company, 9737 Washingtonian Blvd, Gaithersburg, MD 20879-7337. The anticipated award date of this contract is on around July 27, 2007.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD, AIR 2.3.3, has a requirement for Performance Based Logistics (PBL) sustainment support for the V-22 weapon system.  The V-22 weapon system includes the MV-22 for the United States Marine Corps (USMC) and the CV-22 for the United States Air Force (USAF)/Special Operations Command (SOCOM).  Additionally, the contractor will support selected aircraft trainers, simulators, and Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE).  This PBL effort will include the preponderance of V-22 logistics support requirements: supply chain management, including obsolescence and configuration management; maintenance planning and supportability analysis; development and support of technical data; site activation and facilities planning; in-service engineering and logistics support; training and trainer support; and sustainment of PSE.  It will be incumbent upon the contractor to leverage and synchronize aircraft production with logistics support to optimize reliability improvements and reduce costs and logistics footprint.  Examples of the benefits the Government expects to realize from such leveraging and synchronization are:  concurrent implementation of reliability improvements into production aircraft, fielded aircraft, and spare parts; concurrent management of obsolescence on production aircraft, fielded aircraft, and spare parts; concurrent procurement of spare parts and production assets; and use of onsite engineering and logistics support personnel with a robust reach-back capability to production engineering expertise.  The contractor must have the engineering and systems integration expertise to assess how reliability modifications to individual systems or process changes could affect overall aircraft performance or operational usage of the aircraft.  This PBL effort will exclude the following:  Government Furnished Material (GFM), aircraft engines, support equipment managed and separately supported by existing PBL contracts, and those specific systems, subsystems, and components managed by other Government agencies.  A copy of a draft Statement of Work can be viewed at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/index.cfm

  This is a notice of intent to request a proposal from and negotiate with Bell Boeing Tiltrotor Team (currently registered in the CCR as Bell Boeing Joint Project Office), Amarillo, TX, who has been identified as the only responsible source capable of meeting the Government?s requirements.  It is anticipated that a five-year indefinite-delivery type contract with cost-reimbursement, and potentially fixed-price, orders will be awarded to Bell-Boeing for this requirement. 

  Numbered Note 22 applies. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. 

 This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

 Interested parties may identify their interest and submit technical information and a technical capability statement in response to this notice.  Responses without a return address, mailing address, and company telephone number will not be recognized.  Proprietary data in the responses will be protected where so designated.  NOTE:  Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DOD activity.  Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423, or by accessing the CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov/.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

"Time for completion: 540 calendar days  "Proposal receipt date is approximate; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available.

Contract N61331-06-C-0023 was competitively awarded on a best value basis with one of the factors being an initial sample that could pass independently conducted ballistic tests. Subsequently ArmorWorks developed and delivered a first article that was extensively tested by the Government. This item passed this series of tests and the final configuration of the panels has been established. Use of any other source would require retesting, duplication of cost in an amount estimated at $200,000 that could not be recovered through competition, and an unacceptable delay in the LCAC armo!  r panel program. Therefore it is in the Governments best interest to acquire the additional panels from ArmorWorks. Delivery will be to the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, FL 32407-7001. NAICS Code 336992 applies. SBA Size Standard is 1000 employees

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) Charleston, SC, hereafter referred to as SSCC requires a consolidated support contract for critical integration, upgrade, and testing of Management and Control (M&C) systems in ship and at shore facilities, including associated engineering, technical, and logistics support services to support expanded requirements directly related to the Communications Division, Code 52 in-house capabilities. Communications automation programs such as Teleport Management and Control System (TMCS), Element Management System (EMS), and Automated Radio Communications (ARC) are assignments SSCC expects to continue in order to support the modernization of the existing communications infrastructure. The required Software Engineering and support services for Management and Control (M&C) systems are a continuation and consolidation of prior and on-going contract activity administered by SSCC in support of Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), along with Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other Federal agencies.  Specifically the software engineering and M&C Support Services will provide continued support for the Teleport Management and Control System (TMCS), FEMA's Communications Control System, the Element Management System (EMS), the Automated Radio Communications (ARC) System and similar efforts as current and future enhancements are deployed.  In addition to the foregoing, SSCC expects related tasking in support of other modernizing efforts for existing communications infrastructure. The primary places of performance include the Charleston, SC, Norfolk, VA, and San Diego, CA areas; aboard U.S. Naval Ships, U.S. Naval Shore Stations, FEMA Locations and at Joint Service locations worldwide. A brief description of the primary support areas is provided below. 1.1    Teleport Management and Control System (TMCS) - The Teleport Management and Control System (TMCS) provides the integrated and automated management system that monitors and/or controls functions for the Earth Terminal Segment (C, X, Ultra-High Frequency (UHF), Ka, and Extremely High Frequency (EHF)), Baseband Segment, electronic matrix switch, transmission security (TRANSEC) equipment, test equipment, and other facility specific functions for the Teleport program.  TMCS provides remote monitoring and control of major Teleport functions, and the overall management of the Teleport system.  The TMCS capability minimizes the amount of hands- on/manual functions required by Teleport support personnel.  Control is maintained through the use of computer terminals and a local area network (LAN), and also provides for remote monitoring capability at the Theater NetOps Center (TNC).  At the completion of TMCS Build Three, there will be nine Teleport sites, one each located in Northwest, VA; Fort Buckner, Okinawa; Wahiawa, HI; Lago di Patria, Italy; Ramstein, Germany; Camp Roberts, CA; Landstuhl, Germany, Bahrain and Fort Monmouth, NJ. 1.2    FEMA Communication Control System - The FEMA Communication Control System solution will provide an enhanced and fully supportable capability to enable remote management, configuration, monitoring and control of the selected FEMA National Radio System (FNARS) voice communications systems. The solution will also employ several network, communications and hardware components that will enable remote and local M&C capabilities to be extended to all Radio (HF/SATCOM/VLF) assets. This distributed capability is expandable to control RF assets throughout the FEMA RADIO voice communications system region should it be desired in the future. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract is contemplated.  Contract award is estimated to be December 2007.  Numbered Note 22 applies

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration/NESDIS intends to negotiate with the University of Maryland, Baltimore MD., on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41, U. S. C. 253 ( c ) (1), only one responsible source. It is believed that only this entity can satisfy the agency, requirement to provide scientific and technical expertise services for the Task Title:  Fast Radiative Transfer Modules for Cross-track Infrared Sounder CrIS. This Task will develop the capability to compute thermal radiances from a geophysical state using a rapid transmittance algorithm (RTA). These algorithms must be functionally and spectroscopically compatibility with the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). Task 1) Develop an upgrade to the Pre-launch RTA for all the CrIS channels. This RTA will have recent improvements that have been made to support AIRS and IASI.  These include non-LTE correction and variability for all trace gases in the AIRS RTA (CO, CH4, CO2, HN03, N20, S02). We expect this RTA  to be augmented with any changes to the planning for CrIS, such as apodization function, channel centers, of ILS shape. That is, this RTA should be as close to the launch configuration as possible, Task 2) Develop an upgrade to the post-launch infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer IASI TRA including all of the upgrades included in Task 1. This RTA will be utilized as a risk reduction for the CrIS Interferometer, specifically to be used in performing simulation experiments of the Crls channels from the real IASI radiances to demonstrate the expected performance of this suite of satellites. The delivered RTA)s) under this task must be compatible with the  methodology and spectroscopy developed for the AIRS RTA?s and be suitable for design and development of the IASI and Cris product systems. This means that the format of the coefficients and fitting functions must be reasonable close to the expectation of what will be used with the post-launch CrIS processing. 

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE$100K) Interested persons may identify their interest and demonstrate their capability in order to be considered for this opportunity.

All rock (gradation of 6 inches to 3 foot rock, emphasizing the 1 foot to 3 foot size class, with no more than 10% of material smaller than 6 inches) and fill (gravel, sand, silt, and clay) needed for the planned projects may be obtained at Jawbone Quarry.  An excavator and loader would be needed at the quarry to stockpile all needed rock and fill prior to project implementation.  The loader would stay on site at the quarry to load the dump truck, while the excavator would move onto the first project site. Noxious weeds and invasive non-native pest plants, such as bull thistle and woolly mullein, are known to exist near some treatment areas.  Known concentrations shall be avoided. The estimate start work date is September 10, 2007.  The estimate contract time is 30 days.

This modification will: 1) extend the period of performance of the contract from 31 August 2007 to 31 May 2008 with two additional three month option periods, and 2) increase the ceiling dollar amount by $23.5 million, from $142 million to $165.5 million.  The DISN Video Services-Global (DVS-G) system is in the process of being replaced by DISN Video Services-II (DVS-II).  This modification will provide the continuation of current work and the transitioning of current customers to the new system when DVS-II becomes operational.  AT&T owns and operates the equipment and proprietary software for the existing DISN Video Services under the DVS-G contract.  The Network Operations Center is located in an AT&T facility in Dranesville, VA.  The government is unable to turn operations over to another vendor since AT&T owns the equipment.  AT&T is the only vendor to incorporate both dial-up and dedicated Video Teleconference Facilities (VTFs) and provides classified support at the level of security required in the timeframe available.  To maintain operational readiness and continuous capability to perform its primary mission, DoD cannot afford any disruption of DVS-G services.  AT&T provides this secure service at a reliability of 99.6% on dedicated transmission links.  The above contract actions will be awarded sole source to AT&T based on their unique ability and capability to maintain the current video teleconferencing (VTC) services system. All delivery orders processed under the DVS-G contract are, and will continue to be, non-synopsized, sole source orders per the original fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  See Numbered Note 22. All inquiries regarding the sole source modification shall be submitted electronically and directed to Patricia E. Hilton, Contract Officer, at Patricia.Hilton@disa.mil, or Tricia L. Singler, Contract Specialist, Tricia.Singler@disa.mil.  (NAICS) 517110 is applicable to this acquisition.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Gamma Vacuum in Shakopee, Minnesota for the purchase of an Ion Vacuum Pump under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

Sole source determination is based on the need for an Ion Vacuum Pump that is compatible with our existing Gamma Vacuum ion pumps, titanium sublimation (TSP) pumps, pump controllers, and existing stock of spare parts.  Compatibility is required so that this pump and controller can be interchanged with NISTs existing pumps and controllers during emergency conditions to maintain vacuum in critical experiments.  In addition, compatibility is required to use the same stock of spare parts, cables and NIST custom made electronic control interfaces to the control units.  Since only Gamma Vacuum can provide pumps, controllers, and spare parts that are compatible with our existing stock, we require this order to be sole sourced to Gamma Vacuum.  
 		
Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 339111, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on July 26, 2007.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Paul Boesch, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-763-6603, Fax 301-763-4624, Email paul.w.boesch@census.gov
<DESC>INTRODUCTION

The U.S. Bureau Of The Census is assessing the quantity of 8(a) firms around the country that are able to provide media buying services as described above.  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to help the U.S BOC determine the viability of the 8(a) firms who respond to this request.  


DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES

The Census Bureau requires local media buying services for placing recruitment advertisements in 12 Census defined regional areas.  The local media buys will primarily be with traditional recruitment sources such as local newspapers (e.g. classifieds and display ads in county and community newspapers, etc.), out-of-home (e.g. billboards, posters, kiosks, mall and airport displays, bus shelters, street furniture, and other transit advertising), local radio, and local/cable TV and ethnic-targeted media.  However, an ever-increasing percentage of potential job applicants will not be reached by these traditional advertising means; thus, the contractor(s) shall also facilitate non-traditional media buys (e.g. Internet advertising and other print publications such as ?Penny Savers,? ?Shoppers,? etc.), as directed.  

The contractor shall track, monitor, and report weekly on all media buying activities and their associated costs.  The contractor may be tasked with providing local media consulting services such as suggesting specific media outlets and providing media placement strategies to reach targeted audiences with limited advertising dollars.  The contractor must have relationships with local media outlets enabling placement of the ads.  


DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED

Respondents should submit information about their company that will provide the BOC insight into their capabilities.   Information describing your past experiences with the federal government, examples of advertisements you have placed, work you have completed outside of your local area, how you typically price your services, your accounting/ invoicing procedures, your ad monitoring procedures, and any other information pertaining to your ability to place ads in a multitude of media outlets.  


DISCLAIMER

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.  


HOW TO RESPOND

Pleases submit your response to this RFI via email to Kenneth Bradford-Roy at:
Kenneth.Bradford.Roy@census.gov
Phone 301.763.3040

Responses must be received by Friday, July 19, 2007 at 12:00 P.M. EST.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is 43-32NT-0710 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation is unrestricted.  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-17.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516, with a small business standard of 11.5 million.  This product shall be delivered within 60 days after award.  Shipment will be F.O.B. destination with inside delivery to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Beltsville, Maryland 20705. The Government intends to award on a sole source basis to Thermo Electron North America, LLC, Cincinnati, Ohio 45271-2102.  Telephone number (928)428-9661.  This procurement is for the following minimum items: (1) GC Plus TriPlus Autosampler to collect C02 in the headspace of gas samples and introduce it via the C-111 interface. (2) Determine the ratio of 13C/12C.  Researchers need to ascertain the relative amounts of 13C in breadth samples expired by human subjects who have been fed foods or pure compounds labeled with carbon-13.  This information will be used to assess efficacy of labeling target molecules and to optimize the duration and developmental timing of labeling episodes.  In humans, samples will be analyzed for the appearance of 13C in CO2 (e.g. breath) of metabolities (e.g. plasma, urine, feces) after feeding 13C ?labeled foods or 13C-labeled compounds purified from plants.  Among other things, this information will address the apparent low bioavailability of polyphenolic compounds such as anthocyanins, including the possibility that these compounds are rapidly converted to metabolites, some of which may have important biological activity but which cannot be easily quantified without knowing their identity using current technology. Computer Equipment must be Section 508 compliant.  All of the above items are to be issued as a quantity of 1 each.

MCAGCC Access/Security Requirements-Contractor and Contractor-Employee Access Conditions:    1.  Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.  Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below.  Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees.  2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.  Submit the following:   •	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D. •	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof 	of insurance. •	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the 	prime contractor including contract number and term). •	Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year 	covering the previous two years.  Contractor employee background checks are 	conducted at contractor expense.  The background check: (a)	must establish the employee's citizenship or legal alien status.  Acceptable documents include birth certificate, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forms and passports. (b)	must include proof of a criminal records check from the county or state where the employee resided for the previous two years (or length of legal residence for foreign nationals in the U.S. for less than two years).

If the background check is selected for  verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database.  NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at Government expense. Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshal’s Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.

Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractor’s expense. 4.  Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.   5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.   6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee: 	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List. 	b.    is illegally present in the United States. c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant. d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information. 	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations. 7.

Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel. 9.  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.   Offerors shall submit past performance and experience information. The offeror must provide the information requested for past performance evaluation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  Relevant contracts include those held within the past three (3) years with civilian and/or Government agencies for similar types of work.  Offeror’s submitting no past performance information will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offeror’s.  Past performance information shall demonstrates how well the Offeror satisfied its customers on previous contracts and shall  include name(s) for points of contact, telephone numbers, email address, contract number (if !  any), contract price, period of performance, years performed and any unique qualities of the contract.

<DESC>Update 10 July 2007 The synopsis is revised as follows: the final solicitation will be issued without further notice in September 2007 and that contract award is estimated for December 2007. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWARSYSCOM), on behalf of the Program Executive Office (PEO) for Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I), Command and Control Program Office (PMW 150), intends to release Request For Proposals (RFP) number N00039-07-R-0027 for the procurement of Multi-Functional Information Distribution System (MIDS) On Ship (MOS) and associated Link-16 systems. This procurement, originally synopsized 25 October 2005 on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website under solicitation number N00039- 05-R-0046, was suspended indefinitely via the synopsis modification dated 03 April 2006 to enable further assessment of requirements. The current synopsis has been revised to reflect updated requirements. Five (5) distinct configurations of the MOS System may be ordered: 1) High Power MOS System (HPMOS) for shipboard application; 2) Low Power MOS System (LPMOS) for shipboard application; 3) HPMOS System equipped with commercial crypto for shipboard application; 4) LPMOS System equipped with commercial crypto for shipboard application; and 5) High Power Radio Terminal Set intended for use in non-shipboard applications. Link 16 antennas are not procured under this contract. All system configurations delivered shall utilize MIDS Low Volume Terminals (LVTs), provided as Government Furnished Property (GFP) via the Joint Program Executive Officer (JPEO) for Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), MIDS International Program Office (JTRS 10).  The scope of this contract also includes requirements for Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), spares, maintenance and repair, documentation, configuration management, and engineering. The Government anticipates a competitive award of a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  Individual delivery/task orders will be awarded on a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) basis for MOS systems and spares and on a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) basis for services. The basic contract will establish minimum and maximum ordering quantities. The prospective contract will have one (1) one-year base ordering period and four (4) one-year option ordering periods. This is a full and open competition. The final solicitation will be issued without further notice in June 2007 and will be available to interested parties, along with any amendments issued, solely on the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website (https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil/). The MOS System Performance Specification (SPS) will be available in CD format once the solicitation is issued.  A Bidders Mailing List will not be established, and hard copies of documents will not be provided. Contract award is estimated for October 2007. This procurement will require the large business offerors to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan demonstrating efforts to provide subcontracting opportunities for Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Business and other Small Business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334220. The projected proposal due date/time in this synopsis is an estimate only; the actual proposal due date/time will be established in the final RFP. Questions concerning this synopsis may be directed to Jon Wester at jon.wester@navy.mil or telephone (619) 524-7091.

RFQ51603-0011-07 for the provision of Trash Removal Services
located at FCI Three Rivers, Texas

In the original synopsis, the availability date was scheduled as February 09, 2007.  This modification is incorporating a new solicitation availability date of July 11, 2007, with an anticipated date of receipt for quotations to be on August 10, 2007 (2:00 p.m. Central Time).  These dates are projected estimates, and thus potential contractors should refer to the solicitation (1449 - Block #08) for the actual quotation deadlines.  Additionally, the original synopsis indicated an incorrect number of 30 cubic yard containers.  The requirement should correctly read two 30 cubic yard containers.  This modification maintains all the terms of the original synopsis excluding the change in the availability date and the correction in the number of 30 cubic yard containers.  Please ensure your compliance with these terms when providing a quote.

<DESC>Questions/Answers for Solicitation W911RZ-07-R-0014 1.  Have Ft. Carson military personnel previously applied the approximate 30% magnesium chloride/surfactant blend or was the application done by a private contractor?  Answer:  The service was previously performed by a contractor. 2. Will the successful bidder receive payment by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) immediately upon delivery of the submission of the product invoice?  Answer:  The Contractor may be paid by either DFAS or by Credit Card. The Contractor should specify which payment method they prefer in their proposal.  The invoice may be submitted to the contracting office and the COR upon completion of the services requ ested in the delivery order.  The COR then has 3 days to submit a form DD250. Once that form has been completed and sent to DFAS (or to the Contracting Office if by credit card), the invoice will be paid within 30 days. 3.  What are the typical widths for the dirt roads? Answer:  Roads are typically 20 - 30 feet across depending on the location (with or without the shoulder).  A standard lane is around 12 feet. 4.  Is there a water source available to the contractor? What cost? Answer:  No. The contractor shall apply a surfactant simultaneously with the Mag Chloride (therefore no pre-water will need to be applied).

8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:
A)	Background

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) assists Central Asia?s five nations to pursue a stable economy and democracy.  USAID works across the Central Asian Republics (CAR) to develop and improve health, education, job creation, energy, water supply and relations between people and government.  USAID supports opportunities for citizens of these countries to fully participate in improving their governance, livelihoods and quality of life.

USAID's Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible, in close consultation with the five U.S. Ambassadors in the region, for the design and management of USAID assistance programs in five republics.  The central office is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan with offices in Astana, Kazakhstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Osh, Kyrgyzstan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  USAID/CAR is responsible for approximately $80 million of assistance annually, with activities totaling $300 million in the areas of energy and environment, economics and finance, democracy and conflict mitigation, and health and education.

The MCC is in the process of reviewing this concept paper.  The TCP outlines an aggressive two-year program of anti-corruption activities with a budget of approximately $16.5 million which, if approved, would be funded from the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA).  These activities are focused in three areas where the GoK and the U.S. will work jointly:  1) strengthening judicial reform and accountability; 2) combating corruption in law enforcement; and 3) increasing the effectiveness of criminal prosecution.

System:   The wastewater system at Boca Chica Field is comprised of a collection system and treatment plant.  The collections system is comprised of 17,072 linear feet of gravity piping, 20,038 linear feet of force main piping, 14 lift stations and 94 manholes.  The gravity piping consists of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ductile iron, and vitrified clay piping with size ranging from 4? to 10? pipe.  The force main piping is a mixture of PVC, ductile iron, cast iron, and fiberglass reinforced pipe ranging in size from 1.5? to 8?.  The wastewater treatment facility is a 0.4 Million Gallon per Day (MGD) complete mix activated sludge (CMAS) plant consisting of automatic bar screen/grit removal system, flow equalization basin, secondary clarification, aeration basins, aerobic digester, sludge drying beds, and a chorine contact chamber with dechlorination.  The discharge is by gravity to six shallow injection wells. A 90-degree V-notch weir is installed in the end wall of the chlorine contact tank to measure the wastewater flow discharged to groundwater.  The annual total flow to the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was 44.2 million gallons (MG) last year.  The annual average daily flow from April 1999 through March 2000 was 0.12 million gallons per day (MGD).  

Site:  NAS Key West - Branch Regional Medical Clinic (BRMCL) is a site of approximately 15 acres and contains the Family Care Clinic, the Optometry Clinic and the Counseling and Assistance Center.  This site is located on the east end of the city of Key West on South Roosevelt Boulevard.  There are also five senior officer quarters located at this site.  Operating hours are from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.

System:  The wastewater system at the Branch Medical Clinic is comprised of a collection system and a single pump station.  Wastewater from the five senior officer?s houses, Medical Clinic, Energy Building, and a few miscellaneous buildings gravity flows to the pump station located at the loading dock behind the hospital.  Once collected, the wastewater is pumped through a sewer meter adjacent to the pump station and then to a manhole on the other side of Roosevelt Blvd.  The wastewater collection system is comprised of approximately 1,200 feet of gravity sewer, 670 feet of force main and 8 manholes.  The annual wastewater collection from April 1999 through March 2000 was in excess of 7.35 million gallons (MG).  This quantity is more than double the collection from the previous year of 3.20 MG.  This large increase in wastewater collection is attributed to the construction of the new Medical Clinic which was in the final stages in late 1999 and early 2000.

Site:  NAS Key West - Sigsbee Park is a site of approximately 350 acres located in Key West.  This is the site of a family housing complex consisting of 695 units for both officers and enlisted personnel.  The enlisted housing area has two-, three- and four-bedroom units with two full bathrooms.  The officer?s quarters are townhouses and duplex style units ranging in size from 1,045 to 1,937 square feet and were constructed between 1962 and 1965.  Other facilities at this annex include the Navy Exchange, Community Center, Child Development Center and Family Service Center.  Sigsbee Park is a Navy-owned island created by dredge-filling.  It is attached to the north side of the City of Key West (Roosevelt Boulevard) by a causeway.  Sigsbee Park operates 24-hours per day, seven days a week, year round. 

System:  The wastewater system at Sigsbee Park is comprised of a collection system with six pump stations.  The wastewater passes through a sewer meter that is located adjacent to pump station V-4155 before discharging into the City of Key West?s collection system.  The line of demarcation between Sigsbee Park and the City of Key West is the large manhole on Sigsbee Road in front of the guard house located just off of North Roosevelt Road.  The wastewater collection system is comprised of approximately 25,500 feet of gravity sewer, 10,800 feet of force main and 118 manholes.  The wastewater system at Sigsbee Park can be described by three different areas:  Townhouse Area, Capehart Housing, and Wherry Area.  The Townhouse Area sewer collection system is currently under construction to install a new pump station and replace the majority of the existing vitrified clay pipe with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe.  Also, most of the existing manholes are scheduled to be replaced.  This project is expected to be completed by August 2000.  The Capehart Housing Area underwent a major wastewater system renovation in the early 1990?s where four new pump stations and associated force mains were installed and all the vitrified clay piping was replaced with PVC piping.  The Wherry Area consists of antiquated vitrified clay piping with a small portion of PVC piping.  A new lift station was recently installed in this area.

Site:  NAS Key West - Truman Annex is a site of approximately 80 acres (after BRAC).  This Annex, which was formerly the Naval Station, occupies the west end of the Island of Key West.  Major facilities include the Joint Interdiction Agency Task Force-East (JIATF-East), unaccompanied enlisted personnel housing, administrative buildings, maintenance facilities, a fire station and less than 100 family housing units for both officers and enlisted personnel.   Truman Annex operates 24-hours per day, seven days a week, year round.  

System:  The wastewater collection system is comprised of a collection system and one pump station.  Before discharging into the City of Key West?s collection system, the wastewater must pass through one of three sewer meters.  The wastewater collection system is comprised of 14,982 feet of gravity sewer, 690 feet of force main and 35 manholes.  The wastewater system at Truman Annex is described by three different discharge sources:  Housing Area, Commercial Area, and the Harbor Area.  With the exception of some minor renovations from vitrified clay piping to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe in the Housing Area, the collection system at Truman Annex is largely 1950 vintage vitrified clay piping.  One pump station at the Beach Patio elevates wastewater to a manhole that gravity flows to the Commercial Area sewer meter.  A single lift station services the Outer Mole at Truman Annex.  Sewer meter records from April 1999 through March 2000 indicate a total annual collection of wastewater of 1.74 million gallons (MG). 

Site:   NAS Key West - Trumbo Point is located along the north side of the City of Key West. For the purposes of this study, Trumbo Point Annex also includes the areas of Fleming Key and Peary Court housing which are adjacent to the main Trumbo Point Annex site.  The total area for all three sites is approximately 400 acres.  Some of the major facilities on Trumbo Point Annex include 193 family housing units for both officers and enlisted personnel, two swimming pools, tennis courts, a small exchange facility, and a bachelor officers quarters.  Fleming Key is a Navy-owned island of approximately 256 acres located immediately north of Trumbo Point Annex.  Ordnance storage is the major activity on Fleming Key.  Other facilities on Fleming Key include the U.S. Department of Agriculture quarantine station which is now closed, Naval Research Laboratories facilities and the U.S. Army Special Forces Operations complex at the end of the key.  Peary Court is approximately 29 acres located along the north side of the City of Key West, adjacent to the main entrance of Trumbo Point.  This site contains 160 enlisted housing units and a credit union.  Trumbo Point Annex operates 24-hours per day, seven days a week, year round.

System:  The Trumbo Point wastewater system is comprised of a collection system and two pump stations.  Before discharging into the City of Key West?s collection system, the wastewater must pass through one of four sewer meters.    The wastewater collection system is comprised of approximately 28,000 feet of gravity sewer, 9,590 feet of force main and 91 manholes.  The wastewater system at Trumbo Point is described by four different discharge sources:  Housing Area, Industrial/Recreational, Fleming Key and Peary Court.  Both the Housing Area and the Industrial/Recreational Area sewer collection systems are vitrified clay piping.  The wastewater from these areas gravity flows through a sewer meter before discharging to the City of Key West on opposite sides of the base.  One pump station serves the Housing Area and discharges into a manhole about 150 feet away to the South.  The sewer collection system on Fleming Key consists on the 9,000 linear feet of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) force main that runs from the U.S. Army Special Forces Operation Complex to the City of Key Wests? wastewater treatment plant.  Peary Court consists of a PVC piping collection system and a prefabricated pump station which forces the wastewater off base.  The NAS Key West previously operated the area at the Pier on the West side of the base.  This area is currently occupied by the United States Coast Guard and is under pending transfer actions under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) program.  Sewer meter records from April 1999 through March 2000 indicate a total annual collection of wastewater of 147.19 million gallons (MG).

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:  IN-STORE ADVERTISING INITIATIVES.  This announcement is a Sources Sought Notice.  The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to seek sources interested in developing, implementing, and maintaining in-store advertising programs.  There is no solicitation package available nor does this commit the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) to issue a solicitation or make any award(s).  DeCA is seeking companies interested in planning, implementing, and maintaining no cost and/or revenue producing cutting-edge technological solutions used in retail to provide in-store advertising, informational tools, and other value added consumer services.  As examples, programs may include entrance marketing, health and wellness and ordering kiosks, in-store TV advertising, and interactive advertising as well as other tools that are currently in or being tested in the marketplace.  Any costs associated with the development, execution, and continuing management of an offeror?s program will be borne by the offeror and at no cost to DeCA.  Offerors may present multiple programs to DeCA.  Offerors should include a complete listing of trading partners (other retailers) where the offeror?s programs are currently in use.  The Defense Commissary Agency is a Department of Defense (DoD) Agency that manages and operates supermarkets for the Armed Services throughout the world, with annual sales of over $5.4 billion.  Currently, there are 262 stores in DeCA, 171 of which are within CONUS, with the balance of 91 located elsewhere throughout the world.  The commissary benefit exists for the Service members, military retirees, and their dependents.  As such, the commissary presents a family friendly environment and projects such image to its patrons.  Advertising shall not display or consist, in whole or in part, of ads for cigarettes, condoms, alcohol, or any product or service that is contrary to DeCA?s family-friendly environment or that is illegal in the jurisdiction of the commissary locations.  The proposed programs must meet DeCA?s objectives, to include thorough and professionally devised concepts delivered in a consistent fashion throughout the Agency?s stores.  These programs must be flexible enough to accommodate a wide variety of store sizes and layouts, varied and compressed operating schedules, and dissimilar product assortments and department mixes, both in CONUS and OCONUS locales.  They must also demonstrate their impact on patron use, whether it be through sales lift, customer spending habits, and/or patron acceptance/use.  It is anticipated that the DeCA total advertising, informational, and customer services program will blend multiple approaches to the delivery of:  (1) product and service advertising, (2) the enhancement of manufacturers and brand equity within the commissary system, (3) the distribution of coupons, (4) health and wellness services, and (5) the delivery of other value added services aimed at maximizing the customer shopping experience.

<DESC>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. FOR: Technology for Sustained Supersonic Combustion.  The Air Force Research Laboratory, Propulsion Directorate, Aerospace Propulsion Division (AFRL/PRA) seeks potential sources for a sixty (60) month, $14M program to enhance the capabilities of the Supersonic Combustion Ramjet  (SCRAMJET) research located at WPAFB, OH.  NATO participating companies and foreign firms will be excluded from participation in this effort.  Potential contractors and performing personnel must be US citizens.  Performing personnel may be asked to acquire security clearances at the Secret level at any time during the course of the contracted work.  All work will occur at WPAFB, AFRL/Propulsion directorate facilities.  The expected size of the contractor workforce based on current manning should be 16 researchers and technicians.

AFRL/PRA researches technologies applicable to scramjet, ramjet and combined cycle propulsion systems.  The principal area of technical interest for this organization is sustained supersonic combustion and its integration with other high speed engines, rocket powered or turbine powered.  By implementing novel computational, design and diagnostic methods in the pursuit of supersonic combustion ramjet technology, PRA has successfully demonstrated various levels of scramjet combustion in its research facilities and will do so with the future flight test of the AF X51 vehicle.  PRA intends to build upon these successful technologies by seeking industry partners to enhance the state of the art computational, design and diagnostic capabilities at WPAFB.

The effort entails the enhancement, optimization, demonstration, and evaluation of emerging technologies in the field of hypersonics.   The research has been divided into two areas.  The first area focuses on the fundamental technologies employed in the injection of various fuels in liquid, gaseous and super-critical states into high-speed crossflows.  Experiments will be carried out in reacting flowfields.  There is a strong computational element to this area.  The existing computational support provides analysis of 2D and 3D  combustion flow paths.   The computational tools implemented shall be Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS), advanced chemical kinetics modeling for hydrocarbon combustion, advanced turbulence models, nucleation, condensation, evaporation, and RANS/Large Eddy Simulation.  Researchers should have at least 5 years of experience simulating hydrocarbon combustion in scramjet propulsion flow-fields and PhDs in aeronautical or aerospace engineering.  In addition to the computational element, the research team should have members capable of performing combustion diagnostics, preferably in scramjet propulsion flow-fields, ie. direct connect facilities with experience in diagnostic methods such as pitot probes, thermocouples, and pressure transducers.  The second area deals with the design, implementation, testing and analysis of 2D and 3D scramjet components in reacting and non-reacting flowfields.  The components of interests are struts, isolators, flameholding devices, and combustors.  It is expected that testing results will identify components to be scaled-up to 10X scale in the near future.  Critical to any successful engine design will be to explore the use of cavity based flame holding devices and the influences of flow distortion on cavity behavior.  To assist in this exploration, the contractor is expected to utilize various optical diagnostic techniques in conjunction with traditional direct connect test and evaluation diagnostics to ascertain combustion behavior and to determine the scalability of various components.  Researchers should have at least 5 years of experience performing combustion diagnostics, preferably in scramjet propulsion flow-fields, and PhDs in aeronautical or aerospace engineering.  Past experience with diagnostic methods such as pitot probes, thermocouples, pressure transducers, Raman scattering, PIV, PLIF, tunable LEDs, IR and XRay measurements are required for success.

PRA has 3 test facilities capable of providing supersonic conditions for testing, with one of these facilities also having transonic capabilities.  Two facilities can reach temperatures up to 4000 Deg F with vitiation.  Potential bidders must have experience in the operation and maintenance of direct connect facilities and their appropriate hardware and software.  Each facility has its own control room operating a Vista data acquisition support package running on Linux OS.   There are sonic nozzles available for adjusting simulated flight conditions and the contractors can develop their own nozzles for flight regimes of interest.  Contractors will be responsible for documenting all changes to the DAQ systems and facilities including hardware and software.   These personnel will be required to work on-site at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.  

Businesses interested in this effort must respond with a complete capability/qualification package describing the company?s technical expertise, experience, personnel and facilities required to accomplish the work described above. 

The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541710. The small business size standard is 1000 employees.  The purpose of this synopsis is to provide the Air Force technical team with the ability to determine capabilities of potential respondents.  The Air Force is contemplating a small business set aside based on the responses received.  If this acquisition is set aside for small business, the resulting contract will contain the clause FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting which requires (for services) that at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.  Responses to this synopsis shall include a demonstration of the offeror's ability to perform at least 50 percent of the effort.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as amendments to this announcement. All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award. This Sources Sought Notice is also issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. All businesses capable of providing these services are invited to respond. Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this sources sought synopsis. The government requests interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size, business status (i.e., small business, disadvantaged, HUBzone, woman-owned), anticipated teaming arrangements, and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN07-51 - Proposers' Day Workshop for Multipath Exploitation Radar Program
<DESC>DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Workshop in support of the BAA07-58, Multipath Exploitation Radar program on August 15, 2007, at Booz Allen Hamilton, One Dulles Campus, 13200 Woodland Park Road, Herndon, VA  20171 from 9am to 12 pm.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the Multipath Exploitation Radar program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the Multipath Exploitation Radar program is to extend the reach of airborne sensor platforms beyond Line-of-Sight (LOS) limits by peering deep within the shadows of urban canyons.  The range of current sensors in urban environments is limited by LOS blockage due to buildings.  The Multipath Exploitation Radar concept will enable wide area urban surveillance with relatively few platforms by utilizing known multipath propagation between buildings into the urban canyons below.  Ordinarily, multipath is a nuisance for radar systems that causes target ambiguities.  This program will exploit the potential benefits of multipath to provide not only visibility into the urban environment but also distinctive signatures of the urban landscape that will help to localize and track targets moving within the urban canyons.  The first phase of this activity will acquire radar data from urban terrains.  This data will then be provided as Government Furnished Information for the second phase of this program.  A separate BAA will be issued for the second phase of this program.

REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  Participants must register NLT August 10, 2007 at the following website: http://www.schafertmd.com/mer/.   Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website.  There is no registration fee for attending this conference.  Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 100 registrants, and no more than 2 representatives per organization.  The Proposers' Day will be unclassified and open to the general public.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Additionally, all US Citizens are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference.  Non-US citizens are required to submit a DARPA Form 60 "Foreign National Visit Request".  The completed Citizenship Form or DARPA Form 60 must be faxed to:  Allison Strine, SRA International, Inc., fax 703-243-4532, phone 703-875-9526, no later than August 10, 2007.  Both documents are available for download at the registration website.  Attendance is not required to propose to any associated BAA.  After the conference, there will be an opportunity to meet individually with the Multipath Exploitation Radar program manager Dr. Edward Baranoski.  Please contact Allison Strine (Allison_Strine@sra.com), (703) 875-9526 to schedule an individual session.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 541380, identified as FDA-SOL-07-00258, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. Hard copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.
 
STATEMENT OF WORK:
The purpose of this contract is to provide Labview programming support to the CDRH Calibration Laboratory due to the White Oak move and transition to PC based software. Upon completion of programming by vendor, CDRH has ownership and all rights to access and modify the LabView program. Adequate documentation will be provided to verify that CDRH requirements were met. Vendor will provide Labview programming in stages to insure that the quality of work is meeting the needs of the X-ray Calibration Laboratory. 

General requirements 

The computer control system supplies a level of automation over the x-ray system to provide streamlined control, calibration, and monitoring. This automation is focused in four areas: ion 
chamber calibration, exposure rate calculation, automatic set up, and irradiator calibration. The computer control system uses a computer and optically isolated inputs and outputs to monitor 
and control the irradiator. An indexer controls the motors of the positioning track. An IEEE-488.2 card is used to communicate with electrometers. The x-ray system is monitored and 
controlled via an RS-232 connection. 

The control software is powerful yet designed to be simple to use. The core program is LabVIEW, a Windows-based program that is ideally suited for this type of application. It is very 
easy for an operator to use on a routine basis. Only information for routine use is presented to the operator. Selection of options is clear and unambiguous. Status of all system components is shown in a concise display. The control software is designed on a modular approach for functions. Operation screens are set up and customized to exactly match an rradiator. Command modules are written for each feature of the irradiator. Because of the modular design, additional features can be added easily and seamlessly after the system has been installed. 

Ion Chamber Calibration. The control system takes the rradiator, ion chambers, and electrometers through a number of steps that result in a calibration data set and report. When this 
process is started, a set up screen appears allowing the operator to configure such things as: source selection and desired exposure rate, electrometer settings of current vs. charge mode, ion chamber voltage, number of exposures, and exposure time. When the operator starts the calibration, the track is moved to position (if the track is automated), the source exposed, and the data collected. The electrometer is polled based on the set up. Data is written to a database as 
each point is finished. When the first ion chamber is completed, exposures begin for the second ion chamber (typically the reference chamber). When the second chamber is finished, the data is written to a spreadsheet and/or a report generated. This routine can be easily modified to fit a customer's specific procedure. 

Exposure Rate Calculation. With the power of the computer available for calculations, the irradiator control system can calculate the track's X-axis distance based on a desired exposure rate. This calculation includes is based on a polynomial equation that precisely matches the measurement data collected for that beam code/current/position combination. When current is changed, the exposure rate for that position is calculated. The same arrangement holds for time and exposure - when one is changed, the other is calculated and displayed. 

Automatic Set-Up. The automatic set up routine speeds up instrument or dosimeter calibration and increases accuracy by quickly configuring the irradiator to match a procedure. With the change of one button, this routine configures source, attenuator, track position or exposure rate, and time or exposure. These configurations are arranged in procedures and steps that the user defines. Whenever the operator changes a step, the irradiator is re-configured to match that step. 

Irradiator Calibration. The irradiator calibration requires that hundreds of data points be collected to determine exposure rates for distances along the positioning track. This data must 
be collected for each source and each attenuator. With the computer control system, this process is automated. The computer is connected to the electrometer via IEEE 488.2 interface. The irradiator control system presents a set up screen that allows the operator to specify distances, exposure time, and number of exposures at each position. Once the operator starts the exposure,  the control system performs the exposures at each position, collects the exposure rate from electrometer and saves it to a file. The automated sequence continues until all data is collected. An equation curve fit program is used to fit the data to a polynomial equation. The equation is then coded into the software control program. The computer based control system enhances ease-of-use by automating and simplifying steps of the calibration process. It handles the mundane, repetitive tasks and lets the operator concentrate on the calibration procedure.  The source code is supplied with modification rights for all LabVIEW applications. Support is included for helping adapt the software to FDA's existing techniques and procedures. 

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One Base (12 month) Year and one (12 month) option year. Base period: August 1, 2007 - July 31, 2008 Option year 1: August 1, 2008 - July 31, 2009

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A)

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent. The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with J Craig Venter Institute (JCVI)  Inc. for 
sequencing  of  2,000 Kb of Rotavirus RNA,accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Submit offers on NOI-NIAID-7117.. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) .The Epidemiology section in the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases has the capability to sequence Rotaviruses, and has recently partially sequenced 10 isolates in preparation of a Rotavirus Sequencing Project (Change in variables will be disruptive to experiment FAR 6.302-1).  But the laboratory does not have the manpower and capacity to conduct the laboratory and computational efforts needed at a grander scale to study population based aspects of rotavirus evolution and epidemiology, as this will involve the 
sequencing of hundreds of viral isolates.  For that reason, a commercial sequence vendor is required. The J. Craig Venter Institute/JCVI (formerly TIGR) has the capacity to sequence viral
genomes.  Recently JCVI has undertaken a grand effort to sequence 1000s of influenza genomes in the context of a NIAID-led project.  The service provided is ?soup to nuts? in 
that it includes all lab and computational elements required to go from purified RNA that we submit to delivery of publishable sequences and submission to Genbank.  Our lab will provide primers and assist with the development of a sequencing strategy based on our recent experience with all open reading frames of 10 rotavirus genomes..  The NIAID/DMID program officers who are in charge of the influenza genomics project have been extremely pleased with the sequencing services rendered by JCVI in that comparable project; they have consistently met challenges and delivered in a timely fashion.  Therefore we believe JCVI can uniquely meet our sequencing need in the context of our new rotavirus sequencing project.  
All work for all composite genomes will be inspected and approved by the NIAID/DMID project officer or his designee via the reports and flat files submitted. Acceptance Criteria: will be based upon decisions made by the NIAID/DMID project officer. FOB Point shall be Destination,9000 Rockville Pike Bethesda, MD. The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: (B)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation; FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial; FAR52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; FAR 52-212.5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items. FAR 52.246-2 Inspection of Supplies-Fixed Price. By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall have posted their FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items at website http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for 1 each of a Laser Doppler Vibrometer.  The Requirements or Salient Characteristics are as follows:  1.  The sensor shall use a visible light laser operating at no higher than Class II.  Laser viewing goggles shall be provided.  2.	The sensor shall be able to detect frequencies up to 25 kHz or higher.  3.  The sensor shall focus to a minimum stand-off distance of 250 mm with a minimum spot size of 25 micron or smaller.  The sensor shall have autofocus capability.  4.  The sensor shall be capable of measuring displacement as small as +/-2 nm or less, and as large as +/-25 mm or greater.  5.  An analog voltage or milliamp output proportional to displacement shall be provided.	6.  The sensor shall be capable of stand-alone operation with the capability for future control using software via a RS-232 or USB interface.  7.  A velocity output decoder capable of 10 m/s or greater shall be provided.  8.	The sensor head shall be tripod mountable.  Note:  The current requirements are for spot measurement of vibration displacement on a test article (such as a turbomachinery blade). However, in the future, we anticipate a need to perform measurements at large number of locations on the test article to provide a vibration mode shape. This capability is available in a "scanning laser vibrometer", which measures the velocity and displacement of turbomachinery blades undergoing complex vibration modes. A scanning system enables measurement of the entire vibration mode shape in an automated manner.  Some laser vibrometers (laser head and controller) are upgradeable to a scanning system, while others are limited to spot measurements only, and 9.  It is desirable that the system be upgradeable to a scanning laser vibrometer system. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 05-17.

The 4" blackbody sits behind the 3" target aperture (mounted in the big target wheel) and "illuminates" it with infrared radiation of a precise differential temperature relative to room temperature.  The target wheel and hence targets sit at room temperature.  When an imaging sensor views the target (which has a cutout pattern on it) from the front, the sensor sees the cutout areas at the temperature of the blackbody (above or below room temp) surrounded by room temperature structure.  By measuring the sensor's response in frequency and amplitude to the various sizes, patterns, and orientations of targets (there are 16 of them on the big wheel we're buying) over a specific range of differential temperatures, an accurate, quantitative, repeatable characterization of sensor performance can be made.

REVISED STATEMENT OF WORK:

1.	Statement of work

The purpose of this contract is to provide Labview programming support to the CDRH Calibration Laboratory due to the White Oak move and transition to PC based software.  Upon completion of programming by vendor, CDRH has ownership and all rights to access and modify the LabView program.   Adequate documentation will be provided to verify that CDRH requirements were met.  Vendor will provide Labview programming in stages to insure that the quality of work is meeting the needs of the X-ray Calibration Laboratory.  The final product will meet ADA requirements.

General requirements

The computer control system supplies a level of automation over the x-ray system to provide streamlined control, calibration, and monitoring. This automation is focused in four areas: ion
chamber calibration, exposure rate calculation, automatic set up, and irradiator calibration. The computer control system uses a computer and optically isolated inputs and outputs to monitor
and control the irradiator. An indexer controls the motors of the positioning track. An IEEE-488.2 card is used to communicate with electrometers. The x-ray system is monitored and controlled via an RS-232 connection.

The control software is powerful yet designed to be simple to use. The core program is LabVIEW, a Windows-based program that is ideally suited for this type of application. It is very
easy for an operator to use on a routine basis. Only information for routine use is presented to the operator. Selection of options is clear and unambiguous. Status of all system components is shown in a concise display. The control software is designed on a modular approach for functions. Operation screens are set up and customized to exactly match an irradiator. Command modules are written for each feature of the irradiator. Because of the modular design, additional
features can be added easily and seamlessly after the system has been installed.

Ion Chamber Calibration. The control system takes the rradiator, ion chambers, and electrometers through a number of steps that result in a calibration data set and report. When this
process is started, a set up screen appears allowing the operator to configure such things as: source selection and desired exposure rate, electrometer settings of current vs. charge mode, ion chamber voltage, number of exposures, and exposure time. When the operator starts the calibration, the track is moved to position (if the track is automated), the source exposed, and the data collected. The electrometer is polled based on the set up. Data is written to a database as
each point is finished. When the first ion chamber is completed, exposures begin for the second ion chamber (typically the reference chamber). When the second chamber is finished, the data is written to a spreadsheet and/or a report generated. This routine can be easily modified to fit a customer?s specific procedure.

Exposure Rate Calculation. With the power of the computer available for calculations, the irradiator control system can calculate the track?s X-axis distance based on a desired exposure
rate. This calculation includes is based on a polynomial equation that precisely matches the measurement data collected for that beam code/current/position combination. When current is
changed, the exposure rate for that position is calculated. The same arrangement holds for time and exposure ? when one is changed, the other is calculated and displayed.

Automatic Set-Up. The automatic set up routine speeds up instrument or dosimeter calibration and increases accuracy by quickly configuring the irradiator to match a procedure. With the
change of one button, this routine configures source, attenuator, track position or exposure rate, and time or exposure. These configurations are arranged in procedures and steps that the user defines. Whenever the operator changes a step, the irradiator is re-configured to match that step.

Irradiator Calibration. The irradiator calibration requires that hundreds of data points be collected to determine exposure rates for distances along the positioning track. This data must
be collected for each source and each attenuator. With the computer control system, this process is automated. The computer is connected to the electrometer via IEEE 488.2 interface. The irradiator control system presents a set up screen that allows the operator to specify distances, exposure time, and number of exposures at each position. Once the operator starts the exposure, the control system performs the exposures at each position, collects the exposure rate from electrometer and saves it to a file. The automated sequence continues until all data is collected. An equation curve fit program is used to fit the data to a polynomial equation. The equation is then coded into the software control program.   The computer based control system enhances ease-of-use by automating and simplifying steps of the calibration process.  It handles the mundane, repetitive tasks and lets the operator concentrate on the calibration procedure.
The source code is supplied with modification rights for all LabVIEW applications. Support is  included for helping adapt the software to FDA?s existing techniques and procedures.

Vendors determined to be in the competitive range will be contacted to supply a Bid Sample. Samples will be kept for approximately 1 week and then returned.

General Quality Requirements:  All materials are to be clean, brand new and free of any defects.  All workmanship is to be of first quality.  The Agency shall have the sole right to determine if this and all other requirements have been met.
Origin of Manufacture:  Only vest assembled entirely by United States citizens or persons who have legally immigrated and/or applied for United States citizenship will be considered for purchase.
Design Requirements: Concealable soft body armor intended for primary use as an undergarment worn concealed by a uniform or other type of shirt. This ballistic vest shall consist of two primary components- the ballistic panels enclosed by a protective Ballistic Panel cover and the Ballistic Vest Carrier or "outer-shell".
General Design and User Coverage. The soft body armor must provide maximum practical coverage for male and female officers for everyday wear.  However it must not bind or restrict user mobility or wearability.  The intent is provide full wrap, or overlap protection of the torso-coverage is to the maximum available consistent with wearability needs.  The soft body armor is defined as a vest with "full wrap" side panels that provide "overlap" protection. Suitable relief of not more than 1 inch should be allowed between the bottom edge of the vest and the gun belt when standing so that no binding occurs when the Officer is in the sitting position.  Ample relief must be provided in the armpit region for maximum mobility and a 2" or 3" scoop neck must be provided to maintain concealability and prevent the armor from showing when worn under a shirt with an open collar.
Ballistic Panels: The back and front armor panels should be one piece units made of Kevlar or Twaron/LFT Protexa and foam weave armor. The armor must meet or exceed National Institute of Justice (NIJ) 2005 Interim standards and preferably have MilSpec certification for Threat Level II protection from multiple hits and must have concurrent V-50 Ballistic Limit "benchmark" testing with the NIJ 2005 Interim testing and proof of certification and test reports must be submitted with this bid. Level II  Lbs/ft2(.83) Thinness(.29 inches) V-50 9mm (1540) V-50 .357 (1562)Backface 9mm (23.5) Backface .357 (32.38)	
Ballistic Panel Covers The armor must be contained in a heat sealed high elastic hydrolysis/microbial resistant polyurethane outer membrane such as VisiBALLISTICS(patent pending)that is opaque on one side and clear on the other. The membrane must be aromatic polyether polyurethane film/sheets with high crystallinity that facilitate bonding to substrates with water based adhesives.  Additional properties are functional flame retardant, high moisture vapor transfer rate and functional static dissipation.  This will provide the ballistic armor with added protection from moisture and odor while permitting a "Self Check" visual inspection system.  The ballistic covering (membrane) must be sealed by ultrasonic welding to prevent moisture penetration of the armor fibers.  The sonic seaming must hold fabric together as such tensile strength of seal is greater than the components on their own.  You must not be able to pull seam or weld apart once the materials are sonically sealed or welded. The membrane must have Velcro tabs that can attach to the inside of the inner face of the carrier for stability of the armor panels must be contained. There must be an additional soft trauma plate which also meets or exceeds NIJ standards and having concurrent V-50 "benchmark" testing to fit in the carrier front as described below. Included in bid material, minimum testing must be conducted and written verification sent in of below testing. Specific Gravity: ASTM Test Method (D-792)and Value 1.12,
Durometer (Shore A): ASTM Test Method (D-2240) and Value (86.88),

Ballistic Panel labels:  Concurrent with the NIJ-STD-2005 Interim Requirement, each ballistic panel shall have a label that contains the Manufacturer's name, Threat Level, Size, Model, Lot and Serial Numbers, Date of Manufacture, Strike Face, Care instructions, Certification of Compliance and required warnings on vest limitations according to the NIJ-STD-2005 Interim Requirements.
Ballistic Panel Concealed Label:  Each ballistic vest must also contain a concealed label to enable future tracing of the panel by model, serial and lot number, and date of manufacture.
Ballistic Vest Carrier:  two black in color VERTEX multi adjustable carriers will be issued with each vest. Each carrier must have two stealth plate pockets so that the wearer has the option of using either a standard 5x8 inch (13cmx20cm) or an optional 7x10 inch (18cmx25cm) armor plate. Materials used in the construction of the carriers? inner face must be a knit mesh with moisture management, anti-odor, microbial properties on the body side and have Velcro tabs to hold the upper (shoulder) wings of the armor in place and contribute to the stability of the armor in the carrier.  The Face (outer) side of the carrier must be constructed with 75Dx75D Super Mini-Ripstop made of 1005 polyester.  The material must have a DWR finish and weight of 2.7 oz/yd2 with a breaking strength of 160.5#/inch warp and 102.4 inch fill.  Wear abrasion on this fabric must exceed over 20,000 cycles and have a shrinkage warp of 0.8% and 0.4% fill. Carriers should have a four point Velcro strap system with the side straps no narrower than four (4) inches and no wider than four and one half inches (4 1/2) to permit proper and secure fitting.  All carriers must come with attached shirttails; have zippered access slots for the removal and insertion of the armor panels, not Velcro, except for the torso trauma plate pouch which should be Velcro sealed. 
Product Consistency: The manufacturer must warrant that all shipments of each certified model will be identical in design and construction to that which was originally certified.  The manufacturer and NIJ must have retained samples from the original certification for verification and/or inspection.  No substitutions will be allowed without prior approval of both the Agency and the End User Action Officers.
Serialization: All vests must be serialized, 100% inspected and traceable. All procedures and quality data must be available to the Agency for inspection upon request.
Fiber and Fabric Properties: Each lot's critical fiber properties (denier, # of filaments, fiber type, tenacity, and elongation at break) must have been certified by the fiber manufacturer.  Each lot?s critical fabric properties (weave, warp & fill ends/inch, basis weight, thickness, yarn and fabric tensile properties, 9mm and .357 Magnum V-50 ballistic limits) must have been certified by the fabric manufacturer.
Manufacturer Property Checks: The vest manufacturer must also recheck critical fabric properties (fiber/fabric property certifications, weave type, warp and fill ends/inch, basis weight, and 9mm/357 magnum penetration resistances) of each shipment received prior to its use in manufacturing ballistic vests.
Continued Performance: The manufacturer must warrant that the NIJ certified model will continue to perform at its established V-50 Ballistic Limit Levels, as demonstrated by independent laboratory tests, within a normal variation of +/- 3%, throughout the five year service life of the vest.
Plant Inspections:  The manufacturer must allow unannounced plant and data inspections if the Agency wishes to conduct them, at any time during or after the production of the Agency's vests. (Note:  All Agency plant visits and/or ballistic tests will be paid for by the Agency.)

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor?s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 17 July 2007, 10:00 A.M. Pacific Standard Time.  Quotations received after that date and time will not be considered.  Electronic offers submitted via FAX to 510-637-5978 Attn: Roy Gilbert or by email to Roy.L.Gilbert@uscg.mil are acceptable and strongly encouraged.

<DESC>This amendment to Solicitation Number W31P4Q-07-T-2007 is being issued to post requested answers to additional technical questions not previously posted. Closing date for receipt of quotes is extended until 17 July 2007, noon (CST). TECHNICAL ANSWERS  TO QUESTIONS ASKED: 1) Will the dynamometer be provided by the owner? Answer: Yes. 2) Has the dyno been specified? Answer: The technical answers indicate dyno cooling water is not currently required. What type of dyno is proposed (Eddy Current, DC or AC R egenerative)?  Answer:  The enclosure will be initially, and primarily, used as for propeller testing. At some point it may be used for dyno testing and the cooling water issue will be addressed at that time. 3) Will the energy rejected by the dyno be fed to the electrical grid, or run through an absorber? Should dyno heat rejection be figured into the enclosure? This will have a large influence on refrigeration equipment sizing and cost. Answer:  See Answer 2. 4) What test mode will the engine be operated at? Should the heat load be figured for 100 HP at wide open throttle? What time duration will the engine operate at WOT? This will also have a substantial impact on equipment sizing. Answer:  Operating limits were provided for material selection purposes. We are not asking the vendor to remove any heat load. The removal of the heat load will be provided for in another effort.  The engines will run in the chamber anywhere from a few minutes to 12 hours a day. 5) What time frame is desired to bring the chambe r within the range of the testing temperature? Answer:  We are not asking the vendor to provide temperature or humidity conditioning. 6) What tolerance is allowed for the temperature requirements? Answer:  See Answer 5. 7) The solicitation states humidity should be 0-100 percent RH. Is this over the entire temperature range of -40 degrees F -140 degrees F? If not, can the requirement be stated in terms of dew point temperature? a) 0 percent RH at -40 degrees F can not be achieved practically. 10 percent RH at -40 degrees F translates to a dew point temperature of roughly -75 degrees F. In any case, desiccant dehumidification will be required to reach this temperature. Is this expected in the project scope? b) 100 percent RH at 140 degrees F is roughly 1,100 gr/lb of moisture. The 0.4 percent ASHRAE Climatic Design data for the worst humidity condition found in the world is only 186 gr/lb. Is this level of humidity actually desired? Answer:  See Answer 5. 8) What tolerance is allowed for the humidity levels? A nswer:  See Answer 5. 9) The technical answers imply the chamber will be placed indoors. Is this a conditioned space? Refrigeration condensing coils should be placed outdoors to reduce building heat load. Answer:  The chamber will be indoors in an uncondit ioned space. See Answer 5. 10) Are there space restrictions for the HVAC equipment? Answer:  See Answer 5. 11) How will the testing be monitored? Should our proposal included observation ports with heated glass, or a closed circuit camera? Answer:  We will  provide cameras. 12) Heated door seals are commonly used with this type of environment to prevent humidity from freezing the door shut. At these conditions, a small ante room is sometimes used to maintain humidity levels if it is necessary for the operato r to enter the chamber between tests while at temperature. Should these items be considered in the proposal? Answer:  We do not require an ante room. Heated door seals should be considered if required to properly maintain door function. 13) Often, our clie nts also consider adding altitude simulation with engine test chambers of this complexity. Is this something the Redstone Arsenal would like to investigate? Answer:  We don't have an altitude simulation requirement, but would like to discuss that capabilit y with the vendor. **ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT**: Solicitation number W31P4Q-07-T-2007 is being issued as a request for quote.

<DESC>Attached are the pictures you requested on how the jib crane is mounted to the floor.  All jib cranes are encased in concrete.  DOL has fklft sizes up to 10,000 lb, scissor lift is available, and load test weights 10,000 lb (5ton) and 20,000 (10 ton) .    The pictures that show how the jib cranes are mounted to the floor are available via email, they will not transfer to FEDBIZOPS.  I cannot tell you how the cranes are secured in the concrete, would have to waint until the concrete is removed.    We do have a sissor lift, and a variety of forklfts we could provide for the vendor.  We also have concrete weights to load test the crane once it is in place.
