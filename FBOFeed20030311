<DESC>The USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS) intends to negotiate solely with Nonlinear Dynamics, Durham, NC for Progenesis Discovery Image analysis software.  An integral part of ARS's mission is to establish a protein expression profiling capability.  One of the approaches to be developed is a "bottom up" proteomic strategy that involves the fractionation of whole cell protein extracts by two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis followed by spot excision, enzymatic digestion and protein identification by mass spectrometry.  This software will be used to gain insight into the differential expression of proteins under different experimental conditions.  The USDA owns the first generation of bioinformatics platform, Phoretix 2D database, with which progenesis is completely compatible.  Companies with demonstrated capability and financial capacity to provide such software must submit a written substantive statement outlining the company's and software capability to the Contracting Officer within 5 days of publication of this notice.  This is not a request for proposal nor is a solicitation available.

<ARCHDATE>06232003
<CONTACT>Rhonda Chase, (757) 878-3766
<DESC>NA This is a synopsis for a noncommercial Reactive IR Suppressor T700-701C Engine Support program. Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) has a requirement for a Research and Development program to obtain engineering analysis and test support for the in-house development of a preliminary design for a reactive IR suppressor system. The Reactive IR Suppressor program was initiated to meet the needs of Army helicopters and provide the right level of survivability for the right period of time during threat  encounters while minimizing the impact to the helicopter during other operational scenarios. This IR suppressor system will provide improved susceptibility reduction of the helicopter in combat situations while maximizing engine performance characteristic s during routine operations. The objective of the reactive IR suppression program is to perform limited analysis and technical support to assess whether the reactive suppressor degrades performance of the T700-GE—701C engine. Typical IR suppressors add wei ght to an aircraft and restrict the exhaust flow which reduces power available in hover and increases fuel burn in cruise flight. AATD intends to award a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE).  This acquisition will be pr ocured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to Gene ral Electric Aircraft Engines. GEAE’s unique qualifications for fulfilling the contract requirements are based on their sole access to engine technical design data and engine cycle deck data on the T700-GE-701C engine.  Much of the information that would b e used to support this effort is proprietary to GEAE and is not available to other sources. General Electric Aircraft Engine is deemed to be the only responsible source uniquely qualified to perform this program.  Specifications, plans or drawings relating  to this procurement are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  The period of performance for this program is sixteen (16) months.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this is 336412. The anticipated c ontract will require access to and/or generate classified information.  Contractors are required to have Secret facility clearance. While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal which shall be considered .  Written proposals should be addressed to AATD, Attn:  AMSAM-RD-AA-C (Ms. Katherine Kearney (757) 878-5703), Building 401 Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.  Contracting Officer is Ms. Rhonda Chase who can be reached at 757-878-2071 or rchase@aat d.eustis.army.mil.  Anyone desiring an explanation or interpretation of this announcement must request it in writing at the above address (Datafax 757-878-0008 or rchase@aatd.eustis.army.mil.

<DESC>NA This is a synopsis for a noncommercial program entitled Engineering, Analysis, Test and Technical Support (EATTS).   The program objective is to provide various engineering, analysis, test and technical support to insert/integrate and test various technolo gies on the AH-64 fleet of Army aircraft.  The requirement involves AATD or AATD customer initiatives to improve the capability of, expand the service life of, or correct deficiencies of AH-64 variant rotorcraft.  A new indefinite delivery indefinite quant ity (IDIQ) sole source contract will be awarded to The Boeing Company dba McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company (Boeing Mesa).  Under individual orders, AATD will acquire Boeing Mesa support to effect the necessary engineering, analysis, test and technical support necessary to substantiate the candidate concepts/designs.  Testing may involve contractor flight testing using Government-furnished aircraft.  This acquisition will be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1; Only one resp onsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to The Boeing Company dba McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company (Boeing Mesa).  Boeing  Mesa is the original designer and manufacturer of the AH-64 Apache Helicopter series and Boeing Mesa has performed every major modification/ modernization effort for the Army from the original AH-64A through the current D models. Boeing Mesa is the only f irm holding the design, development, and software knowledge necessary to successfully perform the technology integration and test support efforts required by the Government.  Boeing Mesa is deemed to be the only responsible source uniquely qualified to per form this program.  Specifications, plans or drawings relating to this procurement are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  The estimated value/ceiling price of the IDIQ contract is $10,000,000.  The minimum order will be $25,000, whic h will be obligated on the first order concurrent with award of the master contract.  The period of performance for this program is five (5) years.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this is 541710.  The size standard is 1500.  The Government anticipates award of an IDIQ contract providing for Time and Material task orders.  The contract requirements and subsequent orders will be developed jointly between the Government and Boeing Mesa, consistent with alpha contracting  procedures and applicable cost principles, clauses, and provisions in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  Performance locations will vary from the Boeing Mesa facility in Arizona to Fort Eustis, Virginia and other CONUS sites as id entified in each task order.  No options are included in this acquisition.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal which shall be considered.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract for Tactical Tomahawk Full Rate Production (FRP).  The anticipated contract will be a five (5) year multi-year contract.  If the multiyear is not approved, the Navy intends to award a contract with one (1) base year and four (4) option years.  Contract award is planned for the third quarter fiscal year 2004.  This requirement includes the hardware manufacture of All-Up-Round Tactical Tomahawk (Block IV) missiles and related equipment and services.  The contract may include hardware manufacturing and testing; sustaining engineering; Special Tooling and Special Test Equipment; procurement of Range Safety Systems; Product Verification Testing and Functional Ground Testing; Guidance Test Set upgrades, support, maintenance and repair; refurbishment of containers and capsules; Government Furnished Equipment repair and upgrade; engineering and test support; and various elements of logistics support.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Since 1994, RSC has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the TWS.  RSC solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tactical Tomahawk missile, and is the only source capable of meeting scheduled thresholds for Fleet introduction of the Tactical Tomahawk missile.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tactical Tomahawk missile is required to conduct tasking under this contract, RSC is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<DESC>NUWCDIV Newport intends to award a sole source contract to Advanced Engineering & Sciences, Div. Of  ITT Industries, Colorado Springs, CO to update existing designs and to prototype a mounting scheme and hardware to enable easy alignment of up to eight cameras on a visualization system.  In addition, the contractor shall modify the visualization software to allow the projectile developers to view the trajectory from any point-of-view and view angle and evaluate its movement along the test range.  The reason for the sole source is that under a previous contract ITT developed a multi-camera video acquisition system for use underwater to track moving projectiles.  The current requirement is to update the design of the camera mounting scheme and to modify and enhance the 3-D tracking software.  The remote camera control and 3-D motion tracking technologies are direct extensions of the Dormant Motion Sensing System (DMSS) that ITT developed.  Because the tracking technologies and source code are proprietary to ITT, only ITT can satisfy the Government’s requirement. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source using SAP and commercial item procedures as set forth in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by 21 March 2003 will be considered by the Government. A determination not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. NAICS:  541330.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form. Instead, they may be accessed at our web site http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.

<DESC>A presolicitation notice was originally posted indicating other than full and open competition under solicitation number N68936-03-R-0022.  That notice has been canceled and is replaced by this notice.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division intends to procure the development of AV-8B Maintenance Station (AMS) software in support of the Engine Monitoring Unit (EMU) upgrade for the Rolls Royce F402-RR-408A/B engine on the AV-8B Night Attack and Harrier II Plus platforms on a competitive firm fixed price basis.  The AMS software shall be modified to process and display the corresponding parametric data of the new parameter validation, parameter limits, and algorithms that are embedded in the EMU software.  The AMS software shall be modified to generate the fault guided libraries for the new EMU incidents contained in the F402-RR-408A/B Engine Monitoring Systems and AV-8B Maintenance Station Functional Requirements (E/REL/DC/25627).  It is anticipated that the AMS will require a new database when the new parameter list is incorporated with continuous data.  The contractor will be required to perform trade studies and determine the database that will best support the functionality while maintaining supportability of the AMS.  The new database will be prototyped and functionally tested at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA.  The US133 program has been divided into two (2) phases.  Phase I has been completed and provided the upgraded software suite for converting the DOS-based Data Processing Ground Station (DPGS) to the Windows-based AV-8B Maintenance Station (AMS).  Phase II started the maintenance modifications to resolve fleet generated software trouble reports and improvements to the EMU and AMS, however this was not completed.  The AMS software development for the EMU upgrade will entail completing the US133 phase II software and implementing a new database.  Software that was started in Phase II and put on the shelf will need to be completed and functionally tested.  The contract will be for an estimated period of performance of fourteen months (date of award through 30 June 2004).  Detailed information will be provided with the solicitation that will be posted on or about 26 March 2003 at the 2.0 Contracts Competence homepage at: https://contracts.nawcwd.navy.mil/rfp-nawc.htm.  The solicitation will close 25 April 2003.  Award will be issued under the authority of the test program for commercial items (FAR 13.5).  All responsible sources must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at the following website: https://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mil/ccr/scripts/index.html.  Responses must include all information requested in the written Request for Quotation (RFQ).  Evaluation for award will consider meeting the technical requirements and other factors including past performance and price.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation that shall be considered by the agency.  These responses shall be submitted in writing to Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Code 210000D, Bldg. 20259, Attn: Debbie Winfield, China Lake, CA  93555-6100 or fax to (760) 939-9651 Attn:  Debbie Winfield; or email to: Deborah.Winfield@navy.mil.

<DESC>Jewel Cave National Monument Description of Ticketing System Requirements I. Site Introduction: Jewel Cave National Monument is a unit of the National Park Service.   It was established in 1908 to preserve and protect Jewel Cave (currently  the third longest cave in the world) for its scientific value and  public interest.  The site?s visitation is about 100,000 a year.  The  monument is located 13 miles west of Custer, SD and 26 miles east of  Newcastle, WY. II. Fee Program Introduction: Several federal acts and regulations authorize Jewel Cave NM?s  collection of fees.  The monument collects a Daily Recreation fee for cave  tours.  Annually the monument sells about 80,000 tickets for 3 different  tours.  Most of these tickets (about 75%) are sold in June, July and  August.  During the busiest days of the year over 900 tickets will be sold.   During the height of the season, 2 ticket stations will be operating  from 8:00 am. to 6:00 p.m. 7 days a week.  By contrast, in winter there  are days when no tickets are sold.    Staffing includes a year round fee manager and during the summer months  1 lead fee collector and 4 ticket sellers.  There are currently 2  ticket selling stations located in the monument?s visitor center.  There is  also a manager?s station in a fee office.  Plans this summer include  adding a ticket selling station in a kiosk building located next to the  visitor center parking lot.   III. Fee Program History: Prior to 2000 Jewel Cave NM sold tickets on a first come first served  basis using cash registers.  In 2000 the monument became part of the  National Park Reservation System (NPRS) operated by Biospherics  (biospherics changed their name to Spherix in 2001).  In the fall of 2002, the  monument?s management team decided to discontinue the sites use of the  NPRS.  As of January 2003, tickets are being sold using the same cash  registers and methods used up to 2000.  Jewel Cave NM has received funding  to purchase a new ticketing system.   IV. Site?s Computer Infrastucture System: Ø Maximum cable distance from a Switch to PC is 300 feet in the  monument?s visitor center.  There is fiber to the kiosk bulding located next  to the visitor center parking lot.  Our LOCAL network speed is 100 Mbs  MAX (This can go down depending on network traffic). The Wide Area  Network (Internet) is 128 Kbs. Existing monument server uses the NT 4.0 6a  operating system. V. Ticketing System Requirements: Jewel Cave NM is seeking a system with the following capabilities:  § Sell tickets for at least 4 tours (events), each with different  prining and inventory  § Sell timed tickets for at least 24 different tour times (e.g. the  Scenic Tour is presented every 20 -30 minutes from 8:30 a.m. to 6:00  p.m.)  § All tour times must be easily accessible on the ticket selling  screen   § Sell at least 6 different ticket types for each tour (adult, youth,  child, etc.)  § Instantaneously count down an inventory of at least 30 tickets per  tour smialtaneously being sold at three differnet ticket selling  stations  § Inventory count down must be clearly visible on the ticket-selling  screen.   § Ability to over sell inventory  § Provide for later that day and next day ticket sales   § Have a ticket inventory that re-sets each day  § Must track advance sales  § Managers must be able to quickly and easily change ticket inventory  in response to staffing changes, emergencies or group reservations.  § Ticket stations work with a Touch Screen, preferrable  § Manager?s station works with a mouse and keyboard   § An X-out function to allow for cashier breaks with out closing out  § Print a group receipt and individual tickets for each sale  § System is PC based  § Supports one of the following databace platforms: MS Access 97,  Access 2000 or  MSSQL 7.0  § Has multipoint credit card connections (uses internet and modem for  credit card verification)  § It is preferable (but not absolutely necessary) if the monument IT  staff could configure ports  § Ability to split ticket sales into several accounts (Note: Not every  ticket is split the same way; proceeds from some ticket types go to one  account, from others, to several different accounts.)  § Ability to generate ticket sales information in a variety of querys  designated by managers (e.g. one week of sales broken down by ticket  type)  § Good software support, 10/7 acceptable  § Good training materials VI.

<DESC>This solicitation is to provide services to decommission Roads 1015 and 1027 in the Bull Run Watershed on the Mount Hood National Forest.  Road decommissioning is to be accomplished by hydraulic track-mounted excavators, crawler-tractors (dozers), and dump trucks.  Culvert removal will involve excavation of approximately 25 large culverts, which carry live streams.  The volume of excavation is estimated at 500 – 2000 cubic yards per culvert.  Stream diversion will be required to protect water quality.  Following earthwork, exposed soil is to be seeded with weed-free annual rye grass seed (Lolium multiflorum) and mulched with weed-free annual rye grass straw or wheat straw.  Seed shall be applied at the rate of 50 lb./acre.  The contractor shall provide State of Oregon certification of species and purity for both seed and mulch.

An overall plan of work must be submitted, with the contract bid, including: a description of each piece of equipment to be used, a schedule of work with an estimated number of work days for each section of road, and a general plan for stream diversion and water quality control. Due to restricted access to the work site, the contractor will also be required to attend a mandatory Pre-Solicitation Meeting/Site Visit to be held on April 23, 2003.
  
Necessary roads may be minimally cleared of brush, downed trees, etc. to facilitate access to work sites.  Live streams will be diverted from excavated areas to prevent soil from entering the waterway.  A water quality control plan must be submitted and approved for each stream diversion prior to the start of excavation.  Such plans must include a sketch of the stream channel showing how water is to be diverted and a description of the equipment to be used.  Required equipment may include piping, sandbags, plastic sheeting, pumps, hoses and filters.  

A log stringer bridge is to be removed at milepost 4.0, road 1015.  Bridge materials and road surfacing will be disposed of at a nearby site designated by the COR.  Channel banks are to be re-contoured as directed by the COR.  A plan of operation and water quality control must also be submitted and approved by the COR prior to the start of bridge demolition.  Due to safety concerns, this bridge is currently closed to vehicle traffic.

The Contractor shall be responsible for all repairs, maintenance, and operating supplies required in the use of the equipment, as well as furnishing all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, and incidentals to perform all work specified herein.  Should the need for repairs develop, such repairs will be accomplished within two (2) calendar days or the equipment shall be replaced with a comparable piece of equipment at no additional cost to the Government. The contractor will also be responsible for all signing and barricades for traffic control. For more detailed information of specified work, refer to the plans.  This project will be available April 7, 2003.

<DESC>The USDA Agricultural Research Service in Aberdeen, ID has a requirement for corn to be shipped to Guatemala in April of 2003. Our requirement consists of the following: 
01 Nutri Dense Corn qty 120 metric tons 
Possible option 130 Metric tons 
02 Nutri Dense low phytate Corn 120 metric tons 
Possible option 130 metric tons
Specifications for ARS Grain Guatemala Phytate Study
1. We require grain produced by two "near-isogenic" hybrids of corn: 1) a standard hybrid that produces grain with normal levels of grain total phosphorus (about 2.5 to 4.0 mg total phosphorus per gm) and normal levels of phytic acid phosphorus, representing about 75% of grain total phosphorus; 2) a "low phytate" hybrid that produces grain with normal levels of total grain phosphorus but where phytic acid phosphorus is reduced by 80% or more. These two hybrids are required to be "near-isogenic"; nearly identical in their genetic makeup except for differences at one or a few loci that result in the differences in phytic acid content. Other grain
constituents such as zinc concentration should be similar, with less than a 20% difference between the grain produced by  the two hybrids. These two hybrids should not represent  Genetically Modified Organisms, they should be "GMO-free", according to current definitions and practice, and therefore should be free of transgenics according to current testing procedures. 
2. We may require up to 250 metric tons of each.
3. The two hybrids should be grown under identical or highly similar production conditions, at the same location, using identical fertilizer applications and other production practices.
4. The grain should be harvested, dried and packaged for shipment according to the following specifications. It should be packaged in 40 lb bags. No indication of the type of corn should be given on the bags. Instead a color-coding system will be used. Six different colors will be used for the lettering and logos on the bags, three for the normal grain and three different ones for the "low phytate" grain. These six colors and coding names will be provided by the USDA-ARS.  For each type of grain, one-third will be packaged into bags with each of the three color-codes for that type of grain. In addition to the use of the color-codes for lettering and logo on the bags, the first letter of the Spanish word for a given color used on a bag should be printed prominently on the bag. For example, if the color-code is green, or "verde" in Spanish, a prominent "V" would also be printed on the bag.
Requests for RFQ’s can be faxed in or mailed in to the attention of Fred Gifford as listed in this notice.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with University of Alberta, Department of Public Health Sciences, 13-301 Clinical Sciences Building, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada for analyzing 2600 urine samples for total arsenic content and arsenic species.  Total arsenic shall be determined using an Ion Coupled Plasma, Mass Spectrometric (ICPMS) technique.   The arsenic species arsenite, arsenate, monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid shall be determined using a High Performance Liquid Chromatography / Hydride  Generation / Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (HPLC/HG/AAS) method developed by Dr. X. C. Le.  The contractor shall provide the EPA the results of the analyses in a written report.  The period of performance is anticipated to be within 12 months from date of award.  EPA believes that the University  of Alberta is the only source capable of providing the required services based on their development of the analysis method and their ability to provide comparable results to previous analysis for the Arsenic in Drinking Water and Diet Study.   EPA has identified University of Alberta as the only  source with the necessary background and expertise to perform the required services within the prescribed time frame, i.e., FAR 6.3020-1, "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  All interested parties who believe they can provide the  required services should submit a written proposal within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a small business size standard of $6.0 million is applicable.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any  other source(s) exists, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently any response failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Submit responses via the Postal Service to USEPA,  Attn: Jennifer Hill (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC  27711 or via courier service to USEPA, Attn: Jennifer Hill (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 4930 Page Road, Durham, NC  27703.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Mary E. Coleman Contract Specialist 7037871353      Mary.Coleman@mms.gov;
<DESC>**UPDATED INFORMATION REGARDING DATES AND REQUIRED SUBMISSIONS**   As stated in the prior FedBizOps announcement, the Department of  Interior (DOI)/GovWorks is seeking potential contractors to provide a  solution which will allow the processing of invoices electronically,  hereinafter referred to as "e-invoicing".  The e-invoicing shall be posted and  processed through GovWorks' Business Information System (BIS), and  ABACIS, our financial accounting system.  GovWorks currently processes some  1,200 to 1,500 invoices per month for approximately 500 vendors.  This  is a labor and paper intensive environment.  GovWorks' invoice approval  process involves the attention and participation of several different  entities.  These entities include the vendor, procurement assistants,  the COTR, the CO and the Finance department for disbursement of payments.   In order to implement a successful e-invoicing solution, the system  must provide 24 hour x 7 day accessibility to all entities involved.  This  requirement is being issued by GovWorks under the franchise authority  of the Department of the Interior (DOI) in accordance with FAR 13.5,  Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  This is not a request for  competitive proposals.  This competitive process will be simplified in  order to facilitate the acquisition process and prevent undue  administrative burden upon the Contractor(s) and the Government.  The draft  solicitation requirements are now available via GovWorks web site, located at  http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp.  After review of the  solicitation requirements, you may submit questions and comments.  All  Offerors must submit any questions in electronic format, either by mail or  e-mail in Microsoft Word with one (1) printed copy, no later than 4:00  P.M. Eastern Standard Time, Thursday, March 13, 2003, via email to both  Mary.Coleman@mms.Gov and Terrie.Callahan@mms.gov.  The Government  anticipates releasing the questions and answers, via the GovWorks web site,  http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp, no later than Tuesday,  March 18, 2003.  Please be advised that the Government reserves the right  to transmit those questions and answers of a common interest to all  prospective Offerors.  In order to compete for this acquisition interested  parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by  providing a Capabilities Statement which is due no later than 3:00 P.M.  Eastern Standard Time, Friday,  March 21,  2003.  The Government will  review and evaluate the experience and capability of your organization  and proposed project team as demonstrated by the information supplied in  this submittal.  All Offerors must submit an electronic copy in  Microsoft Word plus one (1) original hard copy to the Contracting Officer at  the address specified in this notice.  Your Capabilities Statement  should provide information detailing: (1) your key personnel and program  manager (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or  managing the work) with their qualifications and specific experience  within the electronic invoicing environment; (2) your organizational  experience within the electronic invoicing environment; and (3) specific  references (including contract number &  project description, period of  performance, dollar amount, client identification with point of contact  & telephone number) for previous  related work within the electronic  invoicing environment that your key personnel or organization have  performed within the last two years.  If you believe the Government may find  derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance  record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by  your organization to address the problem.  After review of all  Capabilities Statements, those offerors deemed "Best Qualified" will be provided  additional proposal instructions and contract requirements.  Your  Capabilities Statement will be evaluated based on  your key persons' skills,  abilities and experience within the electronic invoicing environment;  your organization's experience and past performance (including number,  size, and complexity of similar projects, technical excellence,  adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of program management,  willingness to cooperate when difficulties arise, willingness to partner with  the Government in providing robust solutions, general compliance with  the terms of the contracts, and acceptability of delivered product and  service rendered.)

<CONTACT>Cynthia Soules, HH65 Purchasing Agent, Phone 252-335-6641, Fax 252-334-5240, Email CSoules@arsc.uscg.mil
<DESC>The above-cited solicitation is hereby amended to revise the Governments requirement and to extend the closing date.  This requirement is for the manufacture of HH-65 helicopter main rotor blade storage cans in accordance with the specifications stated herein.  The United States Coast Guard (USCG) has the requirement to obtain 150 each new shipping/storage containers for main rotor blades (P/Ns 366A11-0010-05, 366A11-0010-03, 366A11-010-02, and 366A11-0010-06) used on the HH-65 Dolphin helicopters.  The USCG plans to replace the existing shipping containers in order to improve reliability, maintainability, and protection for the main rotor blades.  Blade containers may be stored outside and are therefore exposed to a variety of environmental conditions.  The USCG will provide access to a main rotor blade for the sole purpose of taking measurements and photographs as needed for container design. The location will be at the Aircraft Repair and Supply Center, Elizabeth City, NC or another USCG Air Station.  Access requests shall be coordinated through Mr. Tom Schweers, (252) 335-6612.  Materials used in the container fabrication shall be certified and suitable to meet all requirements of this specification. Standard commercial parts shall be used to the maximum extent possible, consistent with reliability, maintainability, and performance.  Commercial utility parts such as screws, bolts, nuts, with suitable properties, may be used. The containers shall be designed to be repairable and of the minimum practical weight consistent with the requirements of this specification. The containers shall be designed to prevent salt air, water, and dirt intrusion. The packing material shall be molded to fit the contour and outline of the blade. Note: Non-water-absorbing foam is required.  Containers shall have hand-operated, self-contained latches.  These latches shall include over center, cam action, and/or spring-loaded configurations that are convenient to use and provide consistent clamping force.  Physical protection by recessing or shielding is required to prevent damage during normal handling.  All sealing surfaces shall be such to ensure sealing consistent with the requirements of this specification. The main closure flange between the cover and the base shall be configured such that rainwater will not enter the container.  The cover section shall be of a lightweight shell of sufficient rigidity to support one loaded shipping container stacked on top when assembled with the base section and shall contain lifting handles for handling when detached from the base. No obstructions shall exist to interfere with forklift tine insertion when containers are stacked.  Provisions for cover lifting shall be provided. Manual lifting provisions shall be provided when personnel can safely remove or install the cover or section. The cover or section shall be capable of being lifted without injury to personnel and damage to the main rotor blade.  Each container shall be provided with alignment provisions on top and bottom in order to allow rapid and orderly stacking operations for containers of the same part number. These provisions shall provide lateral restraint and shall not interfere with forklift access. The container shall be capable of supporting the superimposed weight of one like container including the contents. The container shall be constructed to permit lifting by forklift truck and pallet jack from the longest side without employing additional blocking and without permanent deformation of the container. The container shell material shall be adequately protected or reinforced so that forklift handling will not result in damage that would prevent the container from performing its intended functions.  The following service facilities shall be incorporated in one end of the container. All facilities shall be recessed within the container wall or otherwise protected.

(1) Record receptacle. A cylindrical receptacle shall be provided of such size as to permit easy insertion and removal of the necessary records. The attitude of the installed receptacle shall be such that water will not collect in it when the record receptacle cover is removed. There shall be no access from the record receptacle into the interior compartment of the container. The receptacle shall be closed from the outside with a watertight cover.  (2) Receptacle covers. All record cover(s) shall be permanently attached to the container by means that will not interfere with the accessibility to the material in the receptacle. The cover shall be capable of being removed and installed by hand or common hand tools. Each container shall be identified with a data plate containing the following information in four-inch letters: Part number of the container; Manufacturers cage code; and the description HH-65 MAIN ROTOR BLADE.  During normal shipping, handling and storage, containers and blades shall be able to withstand shock and vibration and exposure to a variety of environmental conditions.  The container and all accessories shall sustain no damage that would affect the ability of the container or impair its performance.  The main rotor blades shall sustain no damage.  A relief valve, humidity indicator, view ports, drain plug and desiccant basket are not required. Throughout the life of this contract, the contractor shall maintain a quality system in compliance with ISO 9001, ANSI/ASQ Q9001 or a quality system that is subject to the Contracting Officers approval. The contractor shall provide a technical data package to include drawings, specifications, and part numbers used in the container construction.  The contractor shall provide a repair manual and replacement part listing for each container furnished under this contract.  Line Item (1), Technical Data Package for HH-65 main rotor blade shipping/storage containers, quantity 1 each (not separately priced) with delivery no later than thirty (30) calendar days after date of award; Line Item (2), Main Rotor Blade Shipping/Storage Containers, quantity 150 each, delivery of 1 each first article no later than 60 calendar days after contract award and delivery of 149 each production quantity desired no later than 6 months and required no later than 12 months following approval of first article; Line Item (3) Repair Manual and Replacement Part Listing (150 each) to be provided with each container (not separately priced); and Optional Line Item (4), First Article Testing (1 each) no later than thirty (30) calendar days after notification by the USCG.  NOTE:  In the event the USCG requires first article testing, line item (4) may be unilaterally exercised by the Government.  In this event, the contractor shall obtain the testing at a Government-approved testing facility.  Such testing will include, but may not be limited to, flat drop, end impact and vibration testing.  The USCG reserves the right to witness the first article testing in these instances. If first article does not pass the testing, the contractor has thirty (30) calendar days to correct the deficiencies and satisfactorily complete the test.  If a second test is needed, it will be done at the contractors expense.  The following is added to the addendum to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.212-1:  The proposal submitted by the contractor must include pricing for line items 2 and 4 as well as descriptive literature and/or technical data sufficient to evaluate the technical acceptability of the offered containers through analysis or by similarity.  The proposal must also include primer/paint specification and color.  Certification of welders is not required; however, certification of all material used in the fabrication of the containers is required.  Offerors may submit alternate proposals that offer different specifications and prices.  Each proposal must be a complete stand-alone offer with the required supporting documentation and will be evaluated independently against the offerors other proposal(s) as well as other competitors proposal(s).  The evaluation for award criteria is revised to reflect:  The technical evaluation factor includes the following subfactors:  (1) Compliance with the specification; (2) Maintainability; (3) Shock, vibration and environmental protection; (4) Size/weight; (5) Ease of use/handling; and (6) durability.  Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Price is somewhat more important than delivery.  The following is added to the addendum to FAR 52.212-4:  FAR 52.209-4, First Article Approval-Government Testing (SEP 1989), paragraph (a) deliver one unit of line item 1 within 60 calendar days to USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center, Receiving Section, Building 63, Elizabeth City, NC 27909-5001; paragraph (b) Within 20 calendar days; FAR 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (JUL 1990); FAR 52.217-7, Option for Increased Quantity-Separately Priced Line Item (MAR 1989) complete fill-in with within 90 calendar days after receipt of first article; and FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data--General (JUN 1987).  The closing date and time for submittal of quotations is extended until 4 April 2003 at 3:00 P.M. local time.  All other terms and conditions remain the same.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for written information from all parties, especially small and small disadvantaged firms, interested in the upcoming acquisition for base operating support and operation and maintenance services at Eareckson Air Station, Alaska.  The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Responses should focus on your firm's technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services for the operation and support of Eareckson Air Station, as described below.  You should address the contracting officer's interest items on (i) Statement of Objectves (SOO) v. Statement of Work (SOW), and (ii) commercial practices.  Standard publicity brochures are not particularly desired.  Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted.  The contractor shall be responsible for operation and maintenance of Air Force facilities at Eareckson Air Station, Shemya Island, Alaska.  Duties include (partial list) airfield management, operations, and maintenance; on-station management; corrosion control; equipment and facilities repair; fire protection; power production; water treatment and distribution systems; heating systems; roads and grounds (incl. snow removal); fuels management; weather support; and visitor support services (lodging, food, etc.).  The Government will probably issue the solicitation in the early fall of 2003, with award in the February-March 2004 time frame and with performance to begin on 1 October 2004.  The current and previous contracts were solicited on an unrestricted basis, but the Government solicits capability statements and expressions of interest and intent from small businesses.  Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise in airfield management, please include information as to the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement.  Small businesses (including veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned,  HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women-owned, and other small businesses) are particularly invited to respond to express interest in submitting a proposal and to provide information as to their qualifications.  The current contract was acquired with SIC 8744, Facilities Support Management Services.  The corresponding NAICS is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The corresponding size standard is $23M.  The current contract's Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for industry comments.  The contracting officer invites comment from industry as to whether using a SOO would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer.  Under the SOO approach, the Government would issue a SOO as part of it solicitation. The SOO would broadly describe the top-level requirements allowing industry maximum flexibility to propose innovative and cost effective methods to meet those objectives.  The previous acquisition for this requirement was not accomplished under FAR Part 12 because of the complexity and type of contract terms and conditions.  However, responses to this synopsis will be used to assist the contracting officer to determine whether the upcoming acquisition can be accomplished under Part 12.  Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities, and resources to satisfactorily perform the mission as stated in the PWS.  Capability statements of up to 15 pages in length may be submitted to the contracting officer, Timothy Inman, 3CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Elmendorf AFB, AK  99506, and are requested by 24 September 2002.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for written information from all parties, especially small and small disadvantaged firms, interested in the upcoming acquisition for base operating support and operation and maintenance services at Eareckson Air Station, Alaska.  The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Responses should focus on your firm's technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services for the operation and support of Eareckson Air Station, as described below.  You should address the contracting officer's interest items on (i) Statement of Objectves (SOO) v. Statement of Work (SOW), and (ii) commercial practices.  Standard publicity brochures are not particularly desired.  Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted.  The contractor shall be responsible for operation and maintenance of Air Force facilities at Eareckson Air Station, Shemya Island, Alaska.  Duties include (partial list) airfield management, operations, and maintenance; on-station management; corrosion control; equipment and facilities repair; fire protection; power production; water treatment and distribution systems; heating systems; roads and grounds (incl. snow removal); fuels management; weather support; and visitor support services (lodging, food, etc.).  The Government will probably issue the solicitation in the early fall of 2003, with award in the February-March 2004 time frame and with performance to begin on 1 October 2004.  The current and previous contracts were solicited on an unrestricted basis, but the Government solicits capability statements and expressions of interest and intent from small businesses.  Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise in airfield management, please include information as to the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement.  Small businesses (including veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned,  HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women-owned, and other small businesses) are particularly invited to respond to express interest in submitting a proposal and to provide information as to their qualifications.  The current contract was acquired with SIC 8744, Facilities Support Management Services.  The corresponding NAICS is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The corresponding size standard is $23M.  The current contract's Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for industry comments.  The contracting officer invites comment from industry as to whether using a SOO would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer.  Under the SOO approach, the Government would issue a SOO as part of it solicitation. The SOO would broadly describe the top-level requirements allowing industry maximum flexibility to propose innovative and cost effective methods to meet those objectives.  The previous acquisition for this requirement was not accomplished under FAR Part 12 because of the complexity and type of contract terms and conditions.  However, responses to this synopsis will be used to assist the contracting officer to determine whether the upcoming acquisition can be accomplished under Part 12.  Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities, and resources to satisfactorily perform the mission as stated in the PWS.  Capability statements of up to 15 pages in length may be submitted to the contracting officer, Timothy Inman, 3CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Elmendorf AFB, AK  99506, and are requested by 24 September 2002.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division is seeking interest from 8(a) firms with bona-fide places of business in the North Florida District of the Small Business Administration. The Navy is targeting the issuance of additional Blanket Ordering Agreement's, (BOA's). The estimated period of performance will be three (3) years with the Government reserving the right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703 (c). BOA's are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) District Offices. The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southern Division (NAVY) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA Holders will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. On a semi-annual basis, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of: (a) usefulness and need for service, and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only (DesignBuild), to the BOA holders for submission of a proposal. If the parties come to an agreement, a contractual document (task order) will be issued and the BOA holder will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the task order, as directed by the Contracting Officer. Competition for the BOA task orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders in the SBA District noted in this synopsis. However, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition if unable to obtain adequate competition. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, but there is a threshold minimum of not less than $100,000.00 that can be placed on a task order with a maximum of $3,000,000. A project could be awarded at an amount less than $100,000.00, if all parties are in agreement. The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a Best Value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Scheduling and Price. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the BOA holder or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the BOA Holders only. DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The anticipated work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. Covered work includes, but is not limited to, the following types: EMERGENCY REPAIRS: Broken and leaking water lines, gas lines, sewers, storm drains, electric power lines, phone lines, associated structures, interior building repairs, broken doors and windows, etc., exterior repairs, roof leaks, related repairs caused by wind damage, flooding, etc., mechanical problems, HVAC and others. MINOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS: Miscellaneous exterior and interior renovations, fence, shelters, ramps, sidewalks, concrete work, installation or replacement of utilities, pipelines, and conduits, installation of miscellaneous electrical and mechanical devices, roof repairs, demolition projects, asphalt, painting, exterior and interior, ceiling repairs or modifications. DESIGNBUILD: On - site design solutions for emergency calls and DesignBuild Services for minor construction items. The SIC/NAICS Codes covered under the BOA for work performed in the NAICS Groups 233, 234, and 235 for construction. GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers military installations within the Resident Officer in Charge of Construction (ROICC) Pensacola area of responsibility, including NAS Pensacola, NAS Whiting Field, Corry Station, Outlying Landing Fields (OLF), and NAVRESCRUITSTA and NAVMARCORESCEN, Mobile, AL and Montgomery, AL. The agreements will be written for a period of three (3) years. The agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued thereunder. If a firm is graduating from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the agreement holder and the agreement will terminate. Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued. Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation. The agreement holders may be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal. SOLICITATIONS: Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror.

<DESC>The Air Combat Command (ACC) Contracting Squadron at Langley AFB, VA seeks to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, "Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority".  The Air Force is seeking interest and information specifically for the potential privatization of the electric, natural gas, water and wastewater utility systems at numerous Air Combat Command bases.
The objective, should privatization result, is the ownership of the Air Force base's electric, natural gas, water and wastewater systems, operation and maintenance and obligation to continue to provide utility service for an indefinite and ongoing period will transfer to a utility service provider.  All responsibility for providing and maintaining reliable utility service, including such items as, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, maintenance costs, major system renovations, construction, equipment, manpower and overhead costs will become the utility service provider's responsibility.  It is intended that the privatization will ultimately reduce the Air Force's life-cycle costs for operating and maintaining utility systems and services.
This request for interested parties is for gathering information and is a required component of a systematic process to evaluate the interested parties under the Air Force Utilities Privatization Program.  To minimize costs to both potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is being issued to determine the interest and feasibility of proceeding with formal RFPs.  This Request for Interest is not a guarantee on the part of the government that a formal solicitation will be issued.
Parties interested in acquiring any of the Air Force utility systems listed below should provide a statement of interest which includes the Company name, address, email address and phone number for your point of contact, the installation name(s) and system(s) your firm is interested in acquiring.  Also include a description (no more than two pages) of the firm’s capabilities, qualifications, experience and resources available for each system of interest.  Please respond electronically to Damon.Coon@langley.af.mil or by hard copy to ACC CONS/LGCE, 130 Douglas St, 4th Floor Suite 400, Langley AFB,VA  23665-2791.

DAVIS-MONTHAN
UTILITY SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS
General: Davis-Monthan AFB is located in the Sonoran Desert of southern Arizona (AZ), in Pima County, within the city limits of Tucson. The 355th Wing is the host wing at DMAFB. Davis-Monthan AFB occupies 10,633 acres and contains approximately 1850 buildings.  Natural gas is the only system being considered for privatization at Davis-Monthan AFB.
Natural Gas: Natural Gas is supplied to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base by Southwest Gas Corporation through a 4 inch main line and 4 inch meter (Wilmot City Gate) and a 6 inch main line and a 4 inch meter (Swan Gate). These metering and regulating stations serve the base at 35 PSIG. Southwest Gas Corporation owns the two supply lines, metering stations and regulators. The natural gas system is owned by the base from the metering stations onward. These two separate supply systems are linked at the FamCamp area. The main metering station is located just south of the North Ramp near Building 1632. At this station, the lines supplying the housing areas are split from those supplying the main base. All lines are looped except those supplying the Kachina Housing Area. Southwest Gas Corporation also supplies and owns a 4 oz natural gas service to Bldg. 8030 with a separate 1.5 inch main and 1.5 inch meter.
There is an El Paso Natural Gas Company 10 ¾ inch High Pressure Natural Gas pipeline that crosses a southwest portion of the Base. This line is not connected to the Base natural gas system.
There are no physical on-base natural gas wells. The Southwest Gas Corporation metering stations used for billing purposes is identified in Table 7.1.1-1. The Air Force-owned distribution system consists of approximately 366,555 linear feet of underground piping. The majority of the piping is less than 10 years old. The old gas system replaced is carbon steel pipe and is abandoned in place.
Natural gas is used primarily for central gas chiller plant, space heating, hot water, and exclusively for stove, range, hot water and majority heating in all housing. There are service regulators for every building including all housing that reduces the pressure of the gas. Approximately 99 percent of the system piping is polyethylene (PE) and the remaining 1 percent is PVC or carbon steel. The PE piping was installed in the early 1990’s. No cathodic protection systems exist for the natural gas system. The existing 2 inch PVC line with steel risers remains in the trailer park area and is projected to be abandoned in the future. PVC pipe for gas is not industry standard and due to yard irrigation, it is probable that deterioration of the steel risers is likely. Since the steel is not interconnected adding cathodic protection could be costly. Abandonment of the system entirely or a renovation project to upgrade the system to industry standards should be considered for the trailer park area. The PE piping diameter ranges from 8 inches to 1 inch. A total of 40 meters are located within the base gas system.

<DESC>The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab plans to conduct a concept demonstration of a commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) or emerging technology Mobility Command and Control Data Exchange (MC2DE) system.  An MC2DE is needed to dynamically relate all of the information needed to plan and execute worldwide missions by creating publish/subscribe relationships between the information in disparate Air Force Command and Control (C2) systems, so that it appears or acts as if it were in a single shared database, or datacube.  The datacube must be accessible by a multitude of users, from Mobility Air Forces (cargo and tanker aircraft) to Combat Air Forces (fighters and bombers) to civilian agencies and must update, in real-time, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), weather information, military operations data, and diplomatic clearance (DIPCLEAR) data.  MC2DE must continuously compare the mission data with the global conditions data as well as with other missions through a publish/subscribe system.  It must automatically notify the appropriate ground operators, whether in CONUS (i.e., Tanker/Airlift Control Center), or abroad (i.e., Combat Air Operations Center), or both, of potential conflicts before they occur.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: MC2DE must accept mission plans in a format consisting of spatial and temporal information of the right granularity to adequately describe when and where the missions/sorties will be at any given time.  The mission array must also include additional attributes such as DIPCLEARs, aerial refueling, hazardous material, passengers, controlled takeoff time, controlled arrival or crossing times, etc.  This collection of data must be published to a datacube, so that external agencies can see and subscribe to the data for changes (i.e., an air tasking order could subscribe to the sorties in the mobility cube and automatically be updated when a change in the sortie data occurs.)  Data for each mission/sortie should subscribe to external data, whether formally published or not, so that a change in data, such as weather or a NOTAM at a corresponding time/place would trigger an update/action inside the domain to warn the user or automatically re-compute the flight plan, republish, and warn ground operators.  Through this BAA, the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration. The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system readily available to support the requirements.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the USAF, funding will be sought for prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Air Mobility Command. NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 25 March 2003.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Please use the following guidelines when submitting white papers: a) TECHNICAL APPROACH.  Please provide a brief high-level technical description of the proposed Mobility Command and Control Data Exchange system (no more than 1-2 pages).  Ideally, the technical approach should include a scenario illustrating the use of the proposed system.  If applicable, pictures of the system are encouraged (soft copies preferred).  b) RISKS.  Briefly address all potential risks.  Does the system rely on the performance of subcontractors?  c) TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.  Describe the type of training that will be required to operate your system?  How long will the training take?  Briefly summarize how personnel would deploy and operate the system.  d) COMPATIBILITY. Explain system compatibility.  e) ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING.  State the type of environmental testing that has been performed on the system.  What are the temperature and humidity limits within which the system will function properly?  f) COST.  What is the estimated cost or cost range of the proposed system, including low volume production numbers and high volume production numbers?  g) AVAILABILITY.  Provide system availability information.  Is it available off-the-shelf right now?  If not, how soon can it be made available?  h) PREVIOUS WORK.  Briefly explain any previous work you have done or are doing for military/civilian customers similar to what this BAA addresses (include demonstration information that supported that work).  Refer technical questions and submit product information to the Air Mobility Battlelab’s technical representative: Mr. Ed Lillion of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at lillione@ctcnsc.com or mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.  The single point of contact concerning this Sources Sought Notice is Mr. Lillion .  You may contact Mr. Lillion with any questions you may have at (814) 269-6516.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL BAA INFORMATION: This notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2). There shall be no formal RFP. The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the proposals received. The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the technology demonstrated. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.  Respondents are advised that only the Air Mobility Battlelab is legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.

<DESC>The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) plans to conduct a concept demonstration of a commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) or emerging technology Near Real-time Aviation Weather Information Datalink System (NAVWINDS).  Mobility Air Forces (MAF) aircraft require near real-time reception and display of mission relevant weather data/products for C-5, C-17, C-130, and C-141 cargo aircraft, KC-10 and KC-135 tanker aircraft, C-9 aeromedical evacuation aircraft, and all MAF special mission aircraft.  Access to in-flight weather conditions as well as destination and alternate destination airfield weather on a global scale would aid in mission success and decrease aircrew task load.  Weather conditions are likely to change across a typical long duration mission and the current request/response process does not provide an automated means to update mission specific weather information.  This information is necessary for aircrews to effectively circumvent known or forecast areas of hazardous weather, exploit favorable conditions to reach their destination safely, and make prudent weather related mission divert decisions.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION.  The envisioned system would utilize a laptop computer or electronic kneeboard system, which could be carried on and connected to existing aircraft power and antenna systems.  To improve command and control (C2) and weather forecast accuracy for future missions, aircrews require the automated capability to collect, format, and transmit real-time weather data regularly using existing C2 channels without added aircrew workload.  Information available should include graphical images of weather radar, satellite images, winds aloft at all altitudes, icing, convective weather, turbulence, airport METARS, Terminal Area Forecasts, and Significant Meteorological (SIGMET) information in both graphic form and text.  The system should be able to receive data from both military and civilian weather sources. Information should be collected from a variety of weather sources and capable of being delivered through a variety of delivery methods in-flight (INMARSAT, Iridium, VHF/UHF, Telephony, Internet, Direct PC, etc.).  The system should be configured to optimize efficiency on limited bandwidth systems such as Iridium. The ability to use multiple delivery methods will preclude having a separate system dedicated to each type of aircraft.  Through this BAA, the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration. The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system readily available to support the requirements.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the US Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) and the United States Army Reserve and Army National Guard, seeks to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, "Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority" for Utility Privatization of the Listed United States Army National Guard Utility Systems.  The potential privatization actions will include transfer of ownership, operation and maintenance, and the obligation to serve.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an easement as an attachment to the Request For Proposal (RFP).  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.

<SUBJECT>67--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR CAMERA CALIBRATION SYSTEM
<DESC>This is not an announcement of a solicitation.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) for U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) planning purposes based on industry interest, price, and schedule information to design, construct, and deliver a camera calibration system to the USGS capable of calibrating both digital sensors and analog frame cameras used in photogrammetric mapping applications in a laboratory testing environment.  The U.S. Geological Survey, Geography Discipline, has been responsible for aerial camera calibration in the United States since the 1950s.  Historically, metric-quality, analog aerial cameras have been calibrated using a camera calibrator system consisting of banks of collimators to determine:  1) the focal length of the camera lens; 2) the radial and de-centering distortion corrections for the camera lens; 3) the resolution of the lens at various points within the focal plane as well as an area weighted average resolution (AWAR); 4) the positions of the fiducial marks with respect to the optical axis; 5) the flatness of the focal plane; and 6) the dimensions of the focal-plane opening.  The camera calibration system was also required to accommodate cameras from various camera manufacturers (e.g., Zeiss, Jena, Leica).  With the introduction of electronic sensors and computing technology, digital sensors are now being used for precision mapping applications.  The physical design of these cameras is more varied and often include software processing.  However, the photogrammetric community will use both analog and digital cameras in parallel for at least the next decade.  Therefore, the USGS' interest is for a new camera calibration system capable of deriving the same measurements for analog systems that the current system derives and to be able to calculate lens distortion coefficients, lens resolving power, and other relevant characteristics for current digital imaging systems.  Industry response is solicited to indicate level of interest, what capabilities are currently available, schedule information to design, construct and deliver such a system, and commercial pricing information in as much detail as organizations are willing to provide.  Proprietary data that contains restrictions on its release should not be submitted.  Neither a draft statement of work nor specifications are available from the USGS.  No formal solicitation or contract will result from this synopsis for industry information; any subsequent solicitation will be synopsized prior to its release.  Information responding to this request should be received within forty-five days from publication of this notice.  Submit responses to Ron Parsons, USGS, EROS Data Center, Sioux Falls, SD 57198.

<SUBJECT>A--Air Force Corrosion Prevention and Control Office Compressor Development
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service intends to make a time and materials, sole source award to NCI Information Systems, Inc. for the development and testing of more efficient air compressors. This action is a follow-on procurement to a contract previously awarded to NCI Information Systems, Inc. for initial research and development of compressors.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Air Force Corrosion Prevention and Control Office (AFCPCO), AFRL/MLS-OLR, Robins Air Force Base, GA. The AFCPCO ensures that the Air Force has a viable program to prevent, detect, and control corrosion damage on the structures of Air Force systems and equipment and minimizes the impact of corrosion on them.  The PRAM (Productivity, Reliability, Availability, Maintainability) Program was initiated to address this mission.  The development and testing of new technology air compressors is part of the PRAM Program.  The objective of the compressor technology task is the development and testing of more efficient air compressors to be used in shop and flight line applications throughout the U.S. Air Force.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Request for Industry comments on Draft Statement of Objectives for repair/overhaul of the Coast Guard''s HU25 aircraft leading edge slats.  POC Mr. J. J. Tirak, 252-335-6877.
<DESC>U.S. COAST GUARD
HU25 SLAT REPAIR/OVERHAUL
STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
10 MARCH 03

1.0	BACKGROUND 
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate within salt-laden environments.  This condition accelerates the corrosive attack to the HU-25’s leading edge slats.  Over the years the slats have been cannibalized and repaired several times.  Repaired slats do not meet the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM’s) critical profile and contour dimensions for fit to aircraft which contributes to excessive labor hours during installation.  History shows that a complete disassembly of HU-25 slats is necessary for thorough inspections, which commonly require outer skin replacement.  Slats are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking also provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, and item location.  In order to maintain better configuration control, the Coast Guard has assigned and labeled slats with unique Coast Guard part numbers reflecting complete slat assemblies (see ARSC Control Drawing 925-267).
2.0	OBJECTIVE

A.	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to effectively repair/overhaul and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 slat assemblies.  Repaired/overhauled slats must meet the OEM’s critical profile and contour dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal trimming and adjustment during slat installation.  In addition, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated during repair/overhaul. 
3.0	The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of repair for leading edge slats.  First, a “baseline repair” would be required for slats that are subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or impact damage. This would require skin replacement and hardware.  Second, “overhauls” would be required for slats that also exhibit significant wear and/or internal corrosion.  The offeror shall provide a cost break down for items above and beyond a baseline skin replacement.  At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the offeror's technical and cost proposal.  Offeror’s may propose additional levels of service.

The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited, required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, non-serviceable slat storage, preservation, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul slats.
	The offeror’s responsibilities to Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM service bulletins remain incorporated upon completion of work. 

Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center’s (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the winning offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.  
B.	To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria: 
1.	Technical
a.	Provide detailed work specifications for slat baseline repair and overhaul
b.	Provide a written Performance Metrics plan
c.	Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard
d.	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling and fixtures to meet the OEM’s critical profile and contour dimensions per the OEM drawings listed in paragraph 3.0.
e.	Provide separate cost breakdowns for slat baseline repair and overhaul
	Note: The Coast Guard considers a baseline repair as replacement of slat skins and required hardware to make complete slat assemblies.  An overhaul is considered over and above the repair scope and includes replacement of internal assemblies and costly cannibalized components (i.e. bearing and rail supports, internal structures, rails, movable rib assemblies, etc.)
2.	Past Performance  
a.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like items
b.	Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address.
3.0	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 
The following Technical Specifications are applicable:
		a.	OEM drawings: 
	1.	M20H137010B1, slat series, Inboard Slat
	2.	M20H137030B2, slat series, Center Slat
