<DESC>Range Instrumentation Systems, Air Combat Support, Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin Air Force Base (AFB), Florida, plans to award a sole source contract to Cubic Defense Applications, Inc. (CDA), 9333 Balboa Avenue, San Diego, California 92123, for the integration of additional tactical information to support combined/coalition training and provide infrastructure for ground tracking into the Nellis Air Combat Training System (NACTS).  The additional tactical system information will offer the warfighter a real-time common operational assessment of the employment effectiveness of tactical assets.  This new requirement will be called the NACTS Spiral FY04 or NS-04.  The NS-04 effort will build upon the basic NACTS, NACTS Range Security Initiative (RSI), currently being fielded, as well as the NACTS Range Security Upgrade (RSU) and NACTS Range Security Enhancement (RSE) programs currently in development by CDA.  The NS-04 effort will require information and data being developed under these efforts to include CDA proprietary information associated with the RSE effort.  Specific NS-04 tasks will include: 1) A NACTS longevity analysis report to determine what it will take to keep NACTS functional, and operationally in step, with the on-going goal of integrating additional tactical information and providing infrastructure for NACTS through 2012.  This analysis report will include, but not necessarily be limited to:  a) upgrade of the Computational Subsystem operating system to a Personal Computer based control and computation subsystem, b) common display subsystems, c) upgrades to pod processors and Random Access Memory, d) enhancements to pod and ground system security, e) pod test sets, f) upgrades of NACTS masters and remotes, g) elimination of NACTS Ground Security Module, and h) determination of optimum developmental cost/schedule/and operational approach to providing 20 new NACTS pods to replace existing P4AW pods, 2) Upgrading NACTS to incorporate baseline changes to Aircraft Operational Flight Programs, 3) Integration of additional weapon simulations, and 4) Integration of F-22 information into NACTS for post-mission merge and display.  CDA is uniquely capable of performing the required tasks since they developed, installed, and modified the existing training system under NACTS and NACTS RSI programs.  CDA’s extensive knowledge of NACTS, and their current in-development work on NACTS RSU and RSE programs, allows CDA to satisfy the Air Force’s requirements for the NS-04 effort within the program timeline.   In addition, all solutions must be interoperable and compatible with existing NACTS operations and maintenance equipment developed by CDA.  This  directly applies to CDA’s proprietary Individual Combat Aircrew Display System (ICADS), which is fundamental to NACTS and must be addressed in the longevity analysis.  Due to in-depth system knowledge and proprietary aspects of  NACTS, only CDA can effectively and efficiently accomplish the NS-04 effort.  Information associated with this effort is unclassified, or classified up to, and including, SECRET.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Mrs. Karen S. Turner, karen.turner@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850) 882-9391 x 5053, FAX (850) 882-3226.  Technical questions should be directed to the Program Manager, Mr. Jeffrey Wallace, jeffrey.wallace@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850) 882-9391 x 5067.  Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>This acquisition addresses the merging of Cluster 3, the Maritime and Fixed Station Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), and Cluster 4, the Airborne JTRS, programs. This merged program is now referred to as the Airborne, Maritime, and Fixed Station (AMF) JTRS program. The AMF JTRS program has a two-phase development strategy: Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD) and SDD.  Pre-SDD is focused on the system architectures and initial designs for the AMF JTRS, as well as identifying possible cost-effective hardware and software commonality across the operating domains. The purpose of this fifteen (15) month effort, which will be executed concurrently by two Contractors, is to define system requirements and interface requirements and to proceed with initial development of the AMF JTR Set through Preliminary Design Review (PDR).  Pre-SDD will also include a priced option for design through PDR of the Maritime/Fixed Station Service Integration Kits (SIKs). The preliminary design of each selected Contractor will enable the use of commercial-based products and standards to the maximum extent possible and foster high component commonality, while maintaining maximum flexibility and focusing on minimizing initial capability cost. SDD will be a full and open competition, with options for LRIP.  It will include the post-PDR development of a modular AMF JTRS design and associated form factors.  The AMF JTRS communications system shall support growth, technology refresh, and technology improvement with minimum effect on its installed equipment, software, and platform interfaces.

<DESC>This is a requirement for a WEIGHT HANDLING EQUIPMENT MULTIPLE AWARD CONTRACT (WHE MAC) – SOLICITATION NUMBER N3258A-04-R-1900.  THIS SOLICITATION IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.    The WHE MAC will be used primarily for the ordering of new Overhead Electric Traveling (OET) cranes of varying spans and lifting capacities for Navy, Marine Corp, or other federal activities worldwide.  Hoists will be either manufacturers’ standard commercial or custom designed.  In either case however, many of the assemblies and subassemblies will be standard off-the-shelf components.   Bridge girders will typically be custom designed to fit the runway span.  The work contemplated under this procurement will include, but not be limited to, the following:  Site survey/investigation, design, fabrication, rail survey/installation, demolition/removal of existing cranes and equipment, associated runway/equipment electrification, crane installation, crane testing, operational training requirements, etc. While it is anticipated that the WHE MAC will be used primarily for the purchase of new OET cranes, other equipment/services that may be ordered include: 1) Jib Cranes, Monorails, Trolley Hoists, Wall Cranes or similar weight handling equipment; and 2) Reconstitution/overhaul of the various types of weight handling equipment covered by this WHE MAC. Application for use of the weight handling equipment procured under this contract may range from general purpose to more complex applications.  Individual project design requirements will reflect such applications. The Government reserves the right to award up to five Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts under this solicitation or to award only one contract covering only the seed project identified in the solicitation.  Award of the up to five ID/IQ contracts comprising the WHE MAC will be made to the responsible offerors, whose proposals, conforming to the solicitation, are considered to be the most advantageous to the government as a result of a best value evaluation. Technical evaluation factors, when combined, will be considered approximately equal in to price in the best value evaluation.  Award of the initial project (delivery order) covering the design, fabrication, installation and testing of two 10-Ton OET cranes and one 20-Ton OET crane for installation in the Undersea Network Centric Laboratory, Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC), Newport, RI will be made to the offeror whose proposal is considered to be the most advantageous overall as a result of the best value evaluation described above.  Proposal Evaluation factors may include: 1) Price for the initial project; 2) Relevant Past Performance; 3) Management Approach; 3) Technical Experience, Expertise, and Qualifications; 4) Quality Control.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 333923 and the corresponding small business size standard is 500 employees. The total amount of the WHE MAC contract (i.e., the total amount of all delivery orders issued during the contract term, regardless of the number of contracts awarded) shall not exceed $30,000,000.  The WHE MAC contract will be valid for ordering future requirements for up to 5 YRS (i.e., base ordering period of one year, with options for four additional one-year ordering periods) from the date of award, or when the total value of the WHE MAC as described above reaches $30,000,000, whichever occurs first. Future delivery/task orders will be competed only among the up to five successful contractors. Award of each future delivery/task order may be based on either Best Value to the Government or low price. The ID/IQ contract awards resulting from the solicitation will include a minimum guarantee of $10,000.  Award of a delivery order under the ID/IQ contract(s) will satisfy the minimum guarantee.   Delivery/Task orders may require the work of registered professional engineers.     Per the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) has been amended to require that all contractors be registered in the Department of Defense (DoD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Information concerning registration in CCR may be obtained by visiting the website www.ccrdlsc.dla.mil or by referring to DFAR Subpart 204.73.  Offerors should submit verification of their firm’s registration in the CCR database with their proposal.  Be advised that failure to register in the CCR makes an offeror ineligible for award of a DoD contract. The estimated date that the solicitation will be available is 23 February 2004 and the estimated due date for proposals is 9 April 2004.  The address for downloading the solicitation from the internet once available, is http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil.  You must first create an account.  You may view the site without an account.  Once registered and when the request for proposal becomes available, you will receive an email notification informing you that the solicitation documents are available for downloading.  An official plan holders list will be maintained on-line and can be printed from the web site.  Email notification of any changes (amendments) to the solicitation that become available will only be made via the esol website, and only to contractors who register on the site for this solicitation.  Therefore it is the contractor’s responsibility to check the internet site listed above daily for any posted changes to the solicitation plans and specifications.  A pre-proposal conference is scheduled for 9 March 2004. Questions concerning this solicitation must be submitted in writing to Ms. JoAnn Turk, Contract Specialist at joann.turk@navy.mil. Note 1.

D.	AFTER THE DPE  1.	Closing Price Discussions. Discussions concerning price shall normally conclude at the close of the DPE. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the DPE from any of the participants; unless the Contracting Officer re-opens pricing discussions with all participants and requests final price proposals in accordance with FAR 15.307. 2.	No Automatic Award Determination. The Contracting Officer has determined that price is not the only factor to be considered when determining which Offeror shall receive the contract award. Therefore, the Offeror with the lowest price at the clo se of the Dynamic Pricing Event may not automatically be awarded the contract or purchase order that results from this solicitation. 3.	Notification of Unsuccessful Offeror(s). The Contracting Officer shall award a contract based on all the factors identified in this solicitation. The unsuccessful DPE participants will be sent a post-award notification, if required by FAR 15.503(b), via e-mail correspondence or the Procuri.com notification system.

<DESC>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES (NIEHS), NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, INTENDS TO SOLICIT PROPOSALS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL TWIN REGISTRY AND THREE DISEASE SPECIFIC REGISTRIES AS 
RESOURCES FOR INVESTIGATIONS OF GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES IN COMPLEX DISEASE. THE MAJOR PURPOSE IS TO STUDY THE FEASIBILITY AND COST OF ESTABLISHING A UNITED STATES NATIONAL TWIN REGISTRY.  A SECOND MAJOR PURPOSE IS TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY AND COST OF ESTABLISHING THREE INDIVIDUAL, DISEASE-SPECIFIC REGISTRIES FOR TWINS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS), AND SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE).  THIS WILL INVOLVE  RESEARCHING RELEVANT ISSUES AND MAKING A RECOMMENDATION FOR ACTION BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THE RESEARCH.  PREVIOUS TWIN STUDIES HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED THE USEFULNESS OF THIS TYPE OF FAMILY DESIGN IN ETIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS.  THE USE OF TWINS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE STATISTICAL POWER OF A GENETIC STUDY BY EXPLOITING THE UNIQUE DEGREE OF SHARING (BOTH GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL) AMONG TWINS.  COMPARISON  OF CONCORDANCE RATES FOR A TRAIT OR DISEASE AMONG MONOZYGOTIC (MS) AND DIZGOTIC (DZ) TWINS ALLOW  FOR A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE RISK OF DEVELOPING THAT CONDITION IS DUE TO HEREDITARY SHARED OR NONSHARED ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, OR SOME COMBINATION OF THESE.   THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PERFORM THE MAJOR TASKS AS FOLLOWS: (1) PROVIDE CURRENT DEMOGRAPHIC STATISTICS OF TWINS IN THE UNITED STATES BY CONDUCTING COMPREHENSIVE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT POPULATION OF TWINS IN THE US AND STRATIFY THEM INTO DEMOGRAPHIC SUBGROUPS BASED ON THEIR ZYGOSITY, AGE, SEX, RACE/ETHNICITY, SES, URBAN LIVING CATEGORIES, GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION WITHIN THE US, ETC.  THIS WILL HELP TO IDENTIFY SUB-POPULATIONS WITH CONSISTENTLY LOW RATES OF RESEARCH PARTICIPATION WHOM MAY REQUIRE SPECIAL RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION CONSIDERATIONS. (2) PROVIDE IN-DEPTH CURRENT DEMOGRAPHIC STATISTICS OF TWINS IN THE U.S. THAT ARE AFFECTED BY TYPE 1 DIABETES, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, OR SYSTEMIS LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS.  AS PART OF THIS TASK INVESTIGATE AND DESCRIBE THE PROPORTIONS OF US TWINS WITH THESE CONDITIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN EXISTING TWIN REGISTRIES AND/OR PARTICIPATING IN TWIN RESEARCH PROGRAMS CONDUCTED BY REGISTRIES, ACADEMIC, OR OTHER RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS.  (3) EVALUATE THE ETHICAL, LEGAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES THAT WOULD BE ENCOUNTERED IN ESTABLISHING AND OPERATING A NATIONAL AND THREE DISEASE SPECIFIC REGISTRIES.  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL DISCUSS LEGISLATION SUCH AS THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY (HIPAA) AND THE PRIVACY ACTS AND HOW HEY MIGHT AFFECT ESTABLISHING THESE REGISTRIES OR DISSEMINATING PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION IN THE FUTURE, AND HOW THESE ISSUES RELATE TO SPECIAL POPULATIONS INCLUDING CHILDREN, SUBJECTS WITH DIMINISHED CAPACITY, WOMEN, MINORITIES, ETC.  (4) ESTIMATE WHAT PROPORTIONS OF US TWINS DESCRIBED IN TASKS 1 AND 2 ABOVE WOULD LIKELY BE WILLING TO ENROL IN A TWIN REGISTRY AND PARTICIPATE IN REGISTRY SPONSORED RESEARCH PROGRAMS.  THE CONTRACTOR SHOULD RECOMMEND VARIOUS ASCERTAINMENT AND RECRUITMENT METHODS DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE RECRUITMENT OF THE GENERAL US TWIN POPULATION, AS WELL AS SPECIAL ASCERTAINMENT AND RECRUITMENT METHODS THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED FOR SUBGROUPS WITH HISTORICALLY   LOW RECRUITMENT RATES (MINORITIES, NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING, WOMEN, RURAL GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS, LOW SES GROUPS, ETC.)

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with the American Academy of Pediatrics, Washington, DC. Immediately following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the American Academy of Pediatrics established a national Task Force on Terrorism.  Comprised of pediatric experts in such fields as infectious diseases, emergency medicine, disaster planning, and mental health, the work of this Task Force has been governed by three key goals. First, ensure that pediatricians and other health care providers have the information they need about children, terrorism and disasters as fast as it becomes available. Second, ensure that the unique health and mental health care needs of children are considered in all terrorism and disaster planning and response efforts. And, third, ensure that functioning linkages exist between all national, state and local governmental and private entities working on issues concerning terrorism and disasters.

As the dominant pediatric professional society in the U.S., the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have established a track record of producing cutting-edge materials for child health providers with a rapid turnaround.  Since the dissemination of the final products is as important as the development of the materials, AAP’s built-in mechanism to reach all pediatricians nationally enhances the value of their work immensely.  

 THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent by the Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronic Program Office )PMA-209) to issue an order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-03-G-6550 with Rockwell Collins Government Systems (RCGS), 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, IA  52498.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is assigned responsibility for the planning, programming, budgeting, procurement, installation, operation, and support of the Air Combat Electronics programs.  Within NAVAIR, PMA-209 is assigned overall Program Management responsibility for the acquisition and logistics support being provided by both field activities and NAVAIR personnel.  The Rockwell Collins C-12561A Remote Control Unit (RCU) is currently used by the RT-1794(C)/RT-1824(C) radios.  The software for the C-12561A can only be reprogrammed using the Rockwell Collins RCU reprogramming kit and not by current fleet support equipment (AN/USQ-131).  The Rockwell Collins RT-1794(C) & RT-1824(C) can be reprogrammed using the AN/USQ-131.  The RT-1851(C) radio will use the C-12561A for remote control, but will require a separate and distinct software load to control the added features and capabilities present in the RT-1851(C).  The tasking to be provided under this order will be for the development of the capability of reloading the C-12561A RCU via the RT-1851(C) using existing fleet available support equipment AN/USQ-131.  The RT-1851(C) software reprogramming capability shall be compatible with current fleet reprogramming tools.  The C-12561A RCU reload via RT-1851(C) effort will require the development, test, validation, verification, certification, and documentation of a new software load for the RT-1851(C).  The period of performance is anticipated to be through 30 September 2004.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  The ARC-210 radios were previously procured under another contract vehicle and RCGS is the only manufacturer that can provide this software for the utilization on their radios.

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION
for
S5105-04-Q-0025
Computer Based Training (CBT) for Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) Certification
NDT Discipline: Magnetic Particle

I.	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with 
requirements of FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13.106, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only bid document that will be issued. 

II. 	This solicitation, S5105A-04-Q-0025, is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  A fixed-price, bilateral Purchase Order or Delivery Order is the anticipated award. 

III. 	The solicitation document and incorporated provision/clauses are those in effect through FAR 
FAC # 2001-19, dated January 2004. 

IV. 	This solicitation is a small business set-aside IAW FAR 6.203 and FAR 19.502-2.  All eligible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.  The applicable NAICS is 541611, the SIC is 7371, and the small business size standard is $21 million.

V. 	Statement of Work for NDT CBT Certification (13 Nov 03)

a. Background: The Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) performs contract management services for the Department of Defense and other Federal Agencies.  One of the critical contract management functions involves providing Government Contract Quality Assurance activities outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42 Contract Administration and Part 46 Quality Assurance.  Many of the activities outlined in the FAR require Government over-sight of the contractually performed inspections and tests.  One of the critical types of inspections and tests involve Nondestructive Testing (NDT).  Past practice was to certify and re-certify by examination, which was labor intensive and very expensive.  It is proposed that in the future Computer Based Training (CBT) be used to assist in NDT skills maintenance and to serve as a basis for demonstrating currency of skills (Certification Maintenance).  Commercially available CBTs have been identified that incorporates many of the competencies that are necessary for DCMA’s personnel, but additional modules and tests need to be developed to tailor the product for our purposes.

b. Description: Technical and programming services are needed to develop additional modules to augment a commercial Computer Based Training application that will be used to support Nondestructive Testing certification maintenance for NDT Specialists (Level II).  Contractor will provide this CBT service on CDs (Compact Disks) and the final delivery will be two sets of CDs (one Master and one certified copy) from which DCMA will be able to make user copies (if necessary), and 85 re-usable training CDs that cannot be copied by users.  The software must work in the DCMA Microsoft Windows environment and must be compatible with Adobe Acrobat.

	c. Place of performance:  Contractor’s facility.

	d. Date of Delivery:  The expected date of delivery is no longer than 12 months from date of award.
	Offerors should provide a delivery schedule that meets or exceeds the expected date of delivery.

e. No contractor travel.  There will be a post-award meeting with representatives from DCMA at the contractor’s facility.  Date TBD.

f.  Anticipated Contract Line Items are below:

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS IS A RE-ADVERTISEMENT. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to procure construction of the Dr. Nancy Foster Florida Keys Environmental Center on the Old Submarine Boat Basin, Key West, Florida.  The work in the contract includes, but is not limited to: 1) Demolition of a one story (6,918 sq. ft.) building; 2) Removal of 1,982 sq. ft. portion of another one story building which will become Bldg. C; 3) the construction of a new one-story maintenance building (3,600 sq. ft.) – Bldg. A; 4) the construction of a two story administration building (13,000 sq. ft.) – Bldg. B; 5) the renovation and addition to Bldg. C into a one story Visitor Center building (13,246 sq. ft.).  The contractor shall phase work so that the interior of the Visitor’s Center building will be completed and turned over to the Government for installation of the exhibits by January 14, 2005.  The addition to the Visitor Center building and outside construction of the Visitor Center building will be completed by April 22, 2005.  Liquidated Damages for that portion of the work will be required as incentive for timely contract completion. The entire project shall be completed within 426 calendar days after issuance of the notice to proceed.  The contractor will be given notice to proceed approximately June 30, 2004. The completion time includes all adverse weather days and seasonal time loss. The maintenance building and Visitor Center addition will be supported with concrete slab-on-grade and grade beams.  The administration building will be pile supported (augered cast-in-place) with concrete slab on grade and grade beams. Walls are architectural precast panel and roofs are concrete slab on metal roof deck. A portion of the roof over the administration building will be a specific LEED certified construction systems (i.e. green roof). The Contractor shall provide all the labor, material, equipment and each and every item of expense to construct these buildings and structures. The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the Best Value to the Government following the evaluation criteria and cost.  The following technical and performance criteria will be used in evaluating the proposals: (1) past performance, (2) experience with similar types of construction, (3) proposed team and their experience, (4) submission of a construction work plan that not only exhibits understanding of the LEED process but also illustrates a strong plan for quality control and success, and (5) local small business subcontracting.  The technical proposal, including past performance, is equal in importance and weight to the price proposal.  However, as the technical scores of offerors become closely grouped, price becomes a more important factor.  The resultant procurement will be a firm-fixed price contract.  This is a total small business set-aside.  Estimated construction cost of the basic work is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  A portion of this work will be alternate or option items that are dependent on available funding.  Drawings and specifications and bid documents will be available on the NOAA/CASC FTP site on or about February 25, 2004 for offerors to download.  A pre-proposal meeting and site visit will be scheduled approximately 10 days after issuance of the RFP.  Prospective offerors will have a minimum of 15 calendar days to respond following this FEDBIZOPS publication.  Offerors wishing to submit their proposals in response to the solicitation will have 45 calendar days to submit the proposals after issuance of the RFP.  All responsible firms may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  All solicitation requests shall be in writing which may be faxed or e-mailed to Attn: Ron Anielak or Donita McCullough.  Requests must include company name, address, telephone number and indicate registration in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  After CASC receipt of the solicitation request, potential offerors will be notified when the RFP is available for download and be provided instructions for downloading.  Hard copies of the solicitation, drawings, and specifications will not be available.

<CONTACT>Shannon Prince,937-904-4245
<DESC>UPDATE (02-05-04) NOTIFICATION OF AN INDUSTRY DAY The T-38 Flight Training System Program Office (ASC/YTA) of the Aeronautical  Systems Center continues to analyze and assess industry capabilities to provide  an upgrade to the current T-38C escape system to include the aircraft’s  ejection seats and inter-seat sequencing, as well as escape path clearance. The  Government anticipates conducting another Industry Day on the 9th of March in  Bldg 570, Rm. 102 located on the premises of Wright-Patterson AFB, beginning at  8:30 a.m. (EST).  This will be Industry’s opportunity to meet with Government  representatives and to understand how the Government will measure  anthropometrical values once escape system components are installed in the T- 38C mock forebody located at Wright-Patterson AFB.  This meeting will also  provide Industry and the Government an opportunity to discuss program  developments up to this point.   This is also a call for industry to schedule appointments to see the T-38C mock  forebody in a one-on-one environment with the personnel who will conduct the  anthropometrical analysis of submitted systems.  There will be six half-day  appointments available beginning Wednesday, the 10th and ending Friday the 12th  of March, 2004.  Each half-day session will be scheduled on a first-come, first- serve basis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program will be  given. An open forum of question and answers will follow this portion.   Attendees must indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 13 Feb 04 to  Capt Jay Kilpatrick Program Manager, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201-1,  WPAFB, Ohio 45433-7211.  The Government limits attendance to no more than 3  persons per interested party.   How to contact this program: POC:  Capt Jay Kilpatrick (Program Manager), 937-904-4317, Ms Sally Meyer  (PCO), 937-904-4304 ////END OF UPDATE//// UPDATE (01-09-04) POTENTIAL IMPACT OF INCLUSION OF ESCAPE PATH CLEARANCE SUB-SYSTEM IN FIRST  ITERATION During our recent Industry Day, as well as in subsequent T-38 ESUP RFI  responses, a phased approach was suggested as a suitable acquisition strategy  for the ESUP.  We are strongly considering such an approach, but would value  your inputs as we formulate such a program.   One consideration is how to “segment/phase” the program.  In particular, we are  evaluating the benefits of not including the upgraded escape path clearance sub- system from the first phase.  It’s the governments position an upgraded escape  path clearance sub-system presents the greatest technical and schedule risk  over a replacement seat or inter-seat sequencing sub-system.   The Government will not define a design solution for the escape path clearance  sub-system. We will require its performance to be such that it will allow the  overall ejection sequence timing to be kept as low as possible so that we get  maximum system capability from replacement seats. Question:  What do you foresee as the schedule impact of including an improved  escape path clearance sub-system in a first phase of the ESUP?  Please provide  your answer as a function of total system design/development/qualification,  specifying to the greatest extent possible the issues you see as of greatest  concern. Request your response be submitted NLT February 9, 2004 to: ASC/YTA, Capt. E.  Jay Kilpatrick II, Program Manager, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201-1,  WPAFB, Ohio 45433-7211, Phone 937-904-4317 or to: ASC/YTA, Mrs. Sally Meyer,  Contracting Officer, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201-1, WPAFB, Ohio 45433- 7211, Phone 937-904-4304 ////END OF UPDATE//// UPDATE (10-10-03) RELEASE OF 29 SEPT 03 INDUSTRY DAY INFORMATION: 1) List of Attendees 2) 3 Presentations (ASC/YTA; AETC/XPRU; T38ANTHRO_DRZEHNER) 3) List of Questions and Answers  Should you have questions or additional concerns about  the ESUP Industry Day info noted above please email them to  Jason.Ortiz@wpafb.af.mil. ////END OF UPDATE//// UPDATE (10-3-03) MEMORANDUM FOR REGISTRANT FOR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FROM: ASC/YTA  1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201 I Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7211 SUBJECT: T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program, Request for Information (RFI)  1.

Both the time and the location have been determined as follows: We will be holding this conference on Monday, September 29th, 2003 from 1:00pm  to 5:00pm (Eastern Standard Time).  We will be meeting at the Ervin J. Nutter  Center in the "Berry Room" conference facility.  It is located within the  Nutter Center at 3640 Colonel Glenn Highway in Dayton, Ohio, 45435-0001, USA.   This link, http://www.nuttercenter.com/berry/index.html, should provide more  information about the conference center.  A tentative agenda and information on  local accomodations is attached.   /////UPDATE END///// The T-38 Flight Training System Program Office (ASC/YTA) of the Aeronautical  Systems Center is analyzing and assessing industry capabilities to provide an  upgrade to the current T-38C escape system to include the aircraft’s ejection  seats, escape path clearance, inter-seat sequencing, as well as the physical  accommodation of a greater range of aircrew personnel.  The Government  anticipates conducting the first Industry Day on 29 Sep 2003 (specific time and  location to be determined).  This will be Industry’s initial opportunity to  meet with cognizant Government representatives and to discuss the known  requirements and intent of the T-38 ESUP.  We are actively seeking Industry’s  inputs in helping us develop the acquisition strategy for this program.  Due to  size limitations, no more than three (3) representatives per company may attend  this meeting. A simulated T-38C cockpit, to be located at AFRL, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH,  will be available to Industry for inspections, measurements, etc. to aid in  Industry’s partnership with the Government in developing the acquisition  strategy.  The modified cockpit mock-up will be available to Industry  approximately late October/November 2003.  Companies interested in obtaining  access to the mock-up must request this in writing through the individuals  listed at the end of this synopsis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program and the  results of a recent Air Force Research Laboratory anthropometrical study on the  T-38C aircraft will be given. This will be followed by an “open forum” of  question and answers.  Following the open forum, Industry representatives may  individually engage with Government representatives for appointments (one hour  or less) to present their capabilities and concepts.  Maximum leverage  of “available technology” in any technical approach is highly encouraged.  This  is the initial step to establish industry’s understanding of the T-38 ESUP and  to allow the Government to determine market capabilities. Attendees must  indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 10 Sep 03 via the  individuals listed at the end of this synopsis.  Similarly, if you are  interested in having access to the T-38 cockpit mock-up please provide your  request, in writing, to the listed individuals contained at the conclusion of  this synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this RFI and notification.  Submitting capabilities  and concepts in response to this RFI is voluntary and participants will not be  compensated.

<SOLNBR>FA8726-04-R-0001
<RESPDATE>020104
<CONTACT>Richard F. Fox, Contracting Officer, (781) 377-6395
<DESC>This announcement serves as notice to all potential offerors that, on or about 18 December 2003, the Airborne, Maritime and Fixed Station (AMF) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Program Office, Networks and Information Integration (NI) Directorate, Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts anticipates release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) FA8726-04-R-0001 for successful completion of the AMF JTRS Pre-System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase. The AMF JTRS Program has a two-phase development strategy: Pre-SDD and SDD.  Pre-SDD is focused on the Radio Frequency (RF), network, and system architectures and initial designs for the AMF JTRS that will minimize platform integration costs.  The purpose of this fifteen (15) month contract effort, which will be executed concurrently by two Contractors, is to define system requirements and interface requirements and to proceed with initial development through PDR.  A key objective of this Pre-SDD contract is to define and document performance requirements and associated system architectures that enable common software and hardware implementations across form factors/configurations.  The PDR will occur no later than eleven (11) months after contract award.  The resulting modular and scaleable design shall result in a system meeting or exceeding all JTRS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) threshold requirements for the Airborne and Maritime/Fixed Station domains, accommodate all platform requirements, and support network-centric operations.  The results from the Pre-SDD phase (networking attributes, platform interface requirements, and modular design) will feed directly into the Government's SDD planning.  For SDD, the Government plans to conduct a full and open competition to select a single prime system contractor that will qualify the required number of JTR production sources, and to focus on post-PDR design, testing, certification.  The SDD contract will include priced options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) of AMF JTRS. The Pre-SDD acquisition will follow the competitive procedures of FAR Part 15 and associated supplements and utilize full and open competition.  The Government plans to award two (2) cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) and Time and Materials - Labor Hour (T&M - LH) contracts, executed concurrently and conducted independently by the contractors, to complete the Pre-SDD effort.  There will be a requirement for data deliveries consisting primarily of technical reports, specifications, and interface control documents.  The solicitation will be posted on the Internet at the Hanscom Electronic Request for Proposal Bulletin Board (HERBB) website: http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil.  Under "Business Opportunities", set "Type" and "Location" to "ALL", click "Go", and then scroll down to "Airborne, Maritime, and Fixed Station Joint Tactical Radio System."  In addition, the solicitation will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Offerors will be provided forty-five (45) calendar days to respond to the solicitation.  The Government will request that offeror's proposals remain effective for 120 days following receipt by the Government.  Telephone requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.  Foreign-owned firms, including Canadian sources, will not be eligible to compete.  Interested contractors desiring business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Reporting System. The Pre-SDD effort requires access to the following classified information: Unified Information Security (INFOSEC) Criteria (UIC). The Government will post on the HERBB a copy of a DD Form 254 to be downloaded for contractor completion of blocks 6a, 6b, and 6c.  The completed DD Form 254 shall be submitted via facsimile to Mr. Richard Fox, ESC/NIK Contracting Officer, at 781-377-2657.  Upon verification of the DD Form 254, the Government will contact the offeror to set up an appointment for offeror's review at Hanscom AFB, MA at a date no earlier than the release of the RFP.  A hard copy of the completed DD Form 254 shall be provided with the submission of the proposal.  The Pre-SDD effort requires access to certain waveform specifications and other documentation with Government Purpose Rights.  The offeror will be required to sign non-disclosure agreements before any Government Purpose Rights data/information is released to an offeror, per DFARS 227.7013-7 and 252.227-7013(b)(2)(iii)(A). This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal.  It does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Furthermore, offerors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.   Please direct any questions on this NOCA to the following individuals at ESC/NIK: Richard Fox, Contracting Officer, 781-377-6395, Richard.Fox@hanscom.af.mil or Ann Bastek, Contract Specialist, 781-377-7512, Ann.Bastek@hanscom.af.mil. *****  See Note 26.

STATEMENT OF WORK/SPECIFICATION

C.3 SPECIFICATION

The INL/A single engine eradication aircraft performs a variety of missions.  At times the aircraft operate from forward operating base locations under primitive conditions and at other times from international airports with instrument only approaches.  The primary mission is to locate and eradicate illicit narcotic producing plants.  This mission requires that the aircraft have (relative to standard production agricultural spray aircraft) exceptional range and endurance, as well as the capability to fly aerial application operations at altitudes up to 12,000 ft. MSL.  Operations are often flown in very rugged mountainous terrain that requires optimum climb and turn performance at high-density altitudes.  Illicit crops are usually grown in remote areas with few bases from which to operate aircraft.  For this reason, the aircraft is required to have much greater range than standard agricultural spray aircraft.   Reconnaissance missions flown by this airframe are in the same rugged environment as the aerial eradication, but generally require even greater endurance to cover large areas of remote territory.  Further, the aircraft and crews are frequently targeted by hostile fire.  Most hits received have been from NATO ball 7.62mm (sometimes steel core armor piercing) and smaller arms.  A swath guidance system is currently installed on the fleet and is used primarily as a spray guidance system and a spray area organizational tool, but also has a secondary function as a mission recorder providing a vital database for spray analysis and mission evaluation.

C.3.1.  The Department of State’s Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) Office of Aviation (A) has a requirement for aerial herbicide application airplanes to support the USG’s counter narcotics mission.  The aircraft proposed for this request must have the performance and equipment required for meeting or exceeding the current mission requirements of the INL/A  spray aircraft.  Consideration will be given to overall aircraft life cycle and spares inventory costs. The proposed airframe is to be a new, current production aerial application airframe with equipment specific to the INL mission and with minor aircraft modifications as may be required to meet or exceed specifications outlined in this solicitation.  Offerors are invited to propose additional modifications and equipment on a priced option basis that would enhance mission and safety performance of the aircraft.  The contractor shall provide to INL a basic quantity of two turboprop aerial application airplanes that are capable of meeting or exceeding the performance that is currently provided by INL/A’s  spray aircraft. The two aircraft shall be ready for delivery to INL/A no later than 180 days from contract award.  The aircraft shall meet the following mandatory requirements:

<DESC>**CORRECTION NOTE:  The solicitation number in the original FedBizOpps notice was erroneously entered as S-LMAQM-00-R-0033 vice S-LMAQM-04-R-0033.   Information on the Department's web site, www.statebuy.gov, for S-LMAQM-04-R-0033 relates to this synopsis.

The purpose of this notice is to inform prospective offerors of the upcoming pre-proposal conference and site visit.   Complete draft or official RFP documents will be posted imminently on the Department of State website, www.statebuy.gov.

A pre-proposal conference will be held with prospective offerors at the CA/VO Conference Room, 7th Floor, Low Rise, SA-1, Columbia Plaza, 2401 E Street, Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, February 17, 10:00 a.m.   Visitors should arrive early to complete security procedures.  

Prospective offerors shall notify the Contracting Officer by February 15, 2004 if they plan to attend the pre-proposal conference.  The notice shall specify the names of the attendee. Because of space limitations, each prospective offeror will be limited to a total of one representative.   If more space becomes available, we will notify all offerors who have expressed interest in attending.

A site visit will be held at the National Visa Center (NVC) in Portsmouth, New Hamphire on  February 25, at 10:00 a.m.  Appointments should be booked directly with NVC, either Leo Hession (603-334-0928) or Barbara Cawley (603-334-0705).   Because of space limitations, each prospective offeror will be limited to a total of two representatives.    Should response exceed capacity, the government reserves the right to limit attendance to one representative per offeror.

The government will not reimburse any attendee at the pre-proposal conference or the site visit for travel costs or any other expenses.

The pre-proposal conference will be held for the purpose of providing information concerning the Government’s requirements which may be helpful in the preparation of proposals and for answering any questions regarding this solicitation.

Attendance at the pre-proposal conference and the site visit is recommended; however, attendance is not a prerequisite for proposal submission and will not be considered a factor in proposal evaluation.

The success of this conference depends largely on the lead time available to the Government for research in connection with questions submitted by prospective offerors.  Therefore, you are requested to mail written questions concerning any areas of uncertainty which, in your opinion, require clarification or correction, by close of business five calendar days after issuance of this solicitation.

Questions should be submitted to the Contract Specialist in e-mail format at the following address:  MejiaKJ@state.gov and should have “Pre-Proposal Conference Questions” in the subject line.   A set of questions and answers will be furnished to all prospective offerors whether or not they are in attendance.

<DESC>THIS IS A RE-ADVERTISEMENT. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to procure construction of the Dr. Nancy Foster Florida Keys Environmental Center on the Old Submarine Boat Basin, Key West, Florida.  The work in the contract includes, but is not limited to: 1) Demolition of a one story (6,918 sq. ft.) building; 2) Removal of 1,982 sq. ft. portion of another one story building which will become Bldg. C; 3) the construction of a new one-story maintenance building (3,600 sq. ft.) – Bldg. A; 4) the construction of a two story administration building (13,000 sq. ft.) – Bldg. B; 5) the renovation and addition to Bldg. C into a one story Visitor Center building (13,246 sq. ft.).  The contractor shall phase work so that the interior of the Visitor Center building will be completed and turned over to the Government for installation of the exhibits by January 14, 2005.  The addition to the Visitor Center building and outside construction of the Visitor Center building will be completed by April 22, 2005.  Liquidated Damages for that portion of the work will be required as incentive for timely contract completion. The entire project shall be completed within 426 calendar days after issuance of the notice to proceed.  The contractor will be given notice to proceed on or before June 15, 2004. The completion time includes all adverse weather days and seasonal time loss. The maintenance building and Visitor Center addition will be supported with concrete slab-on-grade and grade beams.  The administration building will be pile supported (augered cast-in-place) with concrete slab on grade and grade beams. Walls are architectural precast panel and roofs are concrete slab on metal roof deck. A portion of the roof over the administration building will be a specific LEED certified construction systems (i.e. green roof). The Contractor shall provide all the labor, material, equipment and each and every item of expense to construct these buildings and structures. The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the Best Value to the Government following the evaluation criteria and cost.  The following technical and performance criteria will be used in evaluating the proposals: (1) past performance, (2) experience with similar types of construction, (3) proposed team and their experience, (4) submission of a construction work plan that not only exhibits understanding of the LEED process but also illustrates a strong plan for quality control and success, and (5) local small business subcontracting.  The technical proposal, including past performance, is equal in importance and weight to the price proposal.  However, as the technical scores of offerors become closely grouped, price becomes a more important factor.  The resultant procurement will be a firm-fixed price contract.  This is a total small business set-aside.  Estimated construction cost of the basic work is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  A portion of this work will be alternate or option items that are dependent on available funding.  Drawings and specifications and bid documents will be available on the NOAA/CASC FTP site on or about February 25, 2004 for offerors to download.  A pre-proposal meeting and site visit will be scheduled approximately 10 days after issuance of the RFP.  Prospective offerors will have a minimum of 15 calendar days to respond following this FEDBIZOPS publication.  Offerors wishing to submit their proposals in response to the solicitation will have 45 calendar days to submit the proposals after issuance of the RFP.  All responsible firms may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  All solicitation requests shall be in writing which may be faxed or e-mailed to Attn: Ron Anielak or Donita McCullough.  Requests must include company name, address, telephone number and indicate registration in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  After CASC receipt of the solicitation request, potential offerors will be notified when the RFP is available for download and be provided instructions for downloading.  Hard copies of the solicitation, drawings, and specifications will not be available.

<CONTACT>David Lum, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-205-9587, Fax 202-260-0855, Email dlum@ibb.gov
<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), International Broadcasting Bureau  (IBB) require the performance of their existing transmitters to be enhanced by retrofitting them with digital exciters capable of generating a suitable Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) signal format.  The anticipated requirement will be accomplished via a two-step acquisition process.  To pre-qualify, potential sources shall provide sufficient technical documentation to BBG/IBB to demonstrate that their proposed DRM exciter can successfully be integrated into the following transmitter types when those transmitters are equipped with solid-state modulators manufactured by Continental Electronics or others; the Marconi B6128 and B6132, the Continental Electronics Model 418, 419 (all models) and 420B, and the Brown Boveri SK53 and SK55.  To be acceptable, the Offeror's transmitter(s) must be capable of performance that complies with all IBB contractual specifications when performance data is measured at the output port of the transmitter.  The IBB specification will reference the latest version of European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ESTI), ES 201 980, as the governing document containing criteria for DRM performance.  Portions of the original transmitter performance criteria that are applicable to personnel and equipment safety, audio performance, and unwanted emissions will also be applicable.  Alternate proposals may be submitted if they are clearly marked as such for separate evaluations.  IBB will allow each potential Offeror access to appropriate IBB transmitting stations and to representative transmitter types as needed to allow the Offeror to develop integration techniques for their DRM exciters and to perform demonstrations to the IBB.    In the second step of the procurement, those Pre-Qualified Offerors will be invited to submit a COST PROPOSAL AND DELIVERY SCHEDULE for a specified number of DRM exciters complete with any supplemental parts or items needed for DRM compliant operation along with the final retrofit plans for each transmitter type, spare parts lists and operations and maintenance manuals for the DRM exciter as well as complete schematics and mechanical drawings for the retrofit.   As an option, Pre-Qualified Offerors may also be asked to provide technical support during the conversion of IBB transmitters.  The successful Offeror will be awarded a contract for the delivery of the specified exciter and all related equipment/accessories required for the installation, testing and operation of the above mentioned transmitter types.  IBB is also interested in measuring devices capable of decoding the DRM data format; Offerors are encouraged to include information about them in their submittals.  Qualified sources will be required to provide retrofit, test, and modify/enhance the operational performance of existing transmitters with a digital HF exciter capable of quadrature amplitude transmission.  The BBG/IBB intends to issue a full and open unrestricted solicitation document in accordance with FAR Part 15 for a negotiated firm fixed-price (FFP) procurement with Pre-Qualified Phase One proposals due thirty (30) calendar days thereafter.  Cost proposals and delivery schedules will be due 30 days after Offerors are notified they have satisfied Pre-Qualification criteria.   Award will be based upon product performance, availability and delivery schedule, price and the evaluation criteria stated in the solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal to the BBG Contracting Officer at the above listed address in response to the forthcoming Solicitation No BBGCON3604S5431.  Oral expressions of interest will not be accepted.  Any questions related to the subject solicitation must be submitted in writing to the attention of the Contracting Officer.  All written expressions of interest shall specifically reference this FBO Notice by its title and date of publication.  This notice is not a RFQ, RFP, or an IFB.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  The National Park Service intends to modify its existing contract C2000022300 with Wallace Roberts Todd to add additional quantities not-to-exceed $1,200,000.  This will allow flexibility to design the Proposed Georgetown Waterfront Park located in Rock Creek Park located in urban Georgetown of Washington, D.C.  The Government has determined it is cost effective and in its best interest to continue the design with the same A/E firm rather than compete new requirements because the added work is follow-on to work already performed.   Interested firms are invited to inquire by contacting Marlene Haussler via email:  marlene_haussler@contractor.nps.gov; telephone (303) 969-2159 no later than 2 p.m. (Mountain Time) on February 20, 2004.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration's (NARA) Office of Presidential Libraries is seeking information and capabilities statements from responsible small and large business firms that have the ability to conduct a broad-based, multi-year market research and audience evaluation program for its nationwide system of Presidential Libraries. 

As a preliminary effort, the NARA Office of Presidential Libraries is currently coordinating a test branding effort by developing a Presidential Libraries logo and system-wide brochure. This preliminary effort has helped NARA and the Libraries clarify goals and purposes for system-wide cooperation. The NARA Office of Presidential Libraries has undertaken an evaluation of existing data to determine past trends based upon available information; however, this data may require further analysis.

By the end of calendar year 2004, the Office of Presidential Libraries will oversee eleven Libraries throughout the United States. Locations include:

Herbert Hoover Library, West Branch, Iowa (near Iowa City)
Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, Hyde Park, New York (near Poughkeepsie)
Harry S. Truman Library, Independence, Missouri (near Kansas City)
Dwight D. Eisenhower Library, Abilene, Kansas (near Topeka)
John F. Kennedy Library, Boston, Massachusetts
Lyndon B. Johnson Library, Austin, Texas
Gerald R. Ford Library, Grand Rapids, Michigan
Jimmy Carter Library, Atlanta, Georgia
Ronald Reagan Library, Simi Valley, California (near Los Angeles)
George Bush Library, College Station, Texas (near Houston)
William J. Clinton Library, Little Rock, Arkansas

These are not "libraries" in the usual sense of the word, but rather the official repositories for the papers and historical materials of U.S. Presidents. In addition to making these materials available for use by researchers, the Libraries have a museum component offering exhibits and programs designed to give the general public a better understanding of the individual Presidents, the institution of the Presidency, and the American political system as a whole. With a growing system of Libraries (visited by more than a million people per year combined) and a commitment to educate and inform the public about the Presidency as well as the mission of NARA, the Office of Presidential Libraries wants to increase the general public's awareness of the Library system as a whole. As a means of serving the immediate markets surrounding the individual Libraries, NARA also seeks to increase the number of visitors to the Libraries, increase participation in special educational and public programs, and increase knowledge about the mission and purpose of these unique cultural institutions. To achieve these four goals, the Office of Presidential Libraries wants to: 1) understand the markets in which the Presidential Libraries operate; 2) identify the value in branding the Presidential Library System in local markets and nationwide; 3) identify the best methods to promote the system or the individual Libraries in their markets and elsewhere; 4) obtain and analyze valid demographic and quantitative data about Presidential Library customers over time; and 5) obtain and analyze qualitative data about customer expectations/preferences and program effectiveness over time.
NARA desires to obtain an understanding of the possible time and costs necessary to achieve the Office of Presidential Libraries’ four goals including, but not limited to, the five enumerated requirements above.  As such, it is hoped that the respondents will include rough orders of magnitude for these two factors, i.e. time and costs, which will enable NARA to better formulate parameters for a future requirement.

In order to assist in determining qualified sources for future acquisitions, all business firms responding to this synopsis may provide: (1) the name of the firm, point of contact with phone number and number of employees of the firm, (2) detailed information supporting their capabilities and qualifications to provide the required services, (3) specific relevant contracts being performed or recently completed, especially for other government agencies and/or NARA, detailed description of the work, explanation of how work relates to NARA’s requirement, number of employees working on contract, annual and total dollar value of contracts, contract numbers, points of contact and phone number, and (4) any other pertinent information which would enable the Government to assess the firm’s capabilities. Small business firms responding to this synopsis must state that they are a small business based on the $6.0 million standard for North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) 541910 Marketing Research Services and state which Small Business Administration categories are applicable to their business [i.e., 8(a), HUBZone, Minority-owned, etc.]. This synopsis is for information gathering and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to pay for the information requested, issue a solicitation, or award a contract. All interested firms must submit their complete response to the attention of Mr. Daryl Hawkins no later than 5:00 PM EST on March 3, 2004. Responses should be e-mailed to the above address or faxed to (301) 837-3227. Questions concerning this project must be submitted in writing to the National Archives and Records Administration, Acquisition Services Division (NAA), Room 3360, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland, 20740-6001, ATTN: Mr. Daryl Hawkins (Telephone 301-837-0306, Fax 301-837-3227). Telephone requests will not be honored. *****

<ARCHDATE>04192004
<CONTACT>JoAnn Moller, 732-532-3974
<DESC>This is a market survey to locate sources (System Integrators) for the Lightweight Video Reconnaissance System (LVRS) II.  The LVRS II is used by United States Army Special Forces reconnaissance/scout squads to capture digital still pictures, compres s, and transmit near real-time, still frame images to base stations or battalion tactical operations centers (TOCs) over standard military radios.  The system is comprised of a base station and multiple outstations.  The outstation consists of a day camera  to capture the images, an Image Intensification (IÃ‚Â²) attachment for use during periods of extremely low light (10-4 Foot Candles), as well as a processor to compress the image, add desired text or symbols, display the image, and interface with squad or  team organic radios.  The base station consists of a computer to interface with the TOC base station radios and a color printer to print the images.  Further, the LVRS II base station can retransmit images to other base stations. The LVRS II shall be MIL-STD-2500B with Notice 1, National Imagery Transmission Format Version 2.1 (NITF 2.1) Certified (minimum Level 3).  The LVRS II shall be Joint Technical Architecture Ã¢Â€Â“ Army (JTA-A), Version 6.5 compliant.  LVRS II shall provide  a full range of data transmission capabilities and communication links (e.g. SINCGARS, PSC-5 (Narrow Band, Wide Band, and Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA)), AN/PRC-117F, AN/PRC-148, AN/PRC-150, Special Mission Radio Set (SMRS), and other HF and SATC OM).  Imagery and Data shall be able to be sent over all government voice bandwidth circuits in harsh tactical environments where airtime for transmissions is limited and using cryptographic devices (e.g. KY-57, KY-58, KY-99, KY-99A, KG-84A, KG-84C, KIV-7,  and KY-100) or secure telephones (STU-III, STE).  The LVRS II shall be compliant with; MIL-STD-188-184, Interoperability and Performance Standard for the Data Control Waveform; MIL-STD-2045-44500, National Imagery Transmission Standard (NITFS); and Tactic al Communications Protocol 2 (TACO2).  Hardware and Software shall be user friendly to allow non-technical users to operate the system and be able to transmit imagery in Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) Image Compression for the National Imagery Tra nsmission Format Standard (MIL-STD-188-198A with Notice 2). The LVRS II shall be configurable and compatible with various platforms, i.e. vehicle, aircraft, and man-portable. The LVRS II shall consist of the following major components: an out station and a base station.  The outstation consists of a day sensor and a nighttime sensor with an image intensified night channel (I2 tube will be provided as Government Furnished Equipm ent (GFE)) to include a lightweight handheld portable processor and a sensor with day/night capabilities, which can be remotely triggered.  A remote shall give the operator the ability to remotely control the modular sensor (e.g. focus, zoom, capture, save ) and send still frame images when the handle held portable processor is being operated from a remote location.  Image compression and military communication interfaces allow the user to record digital still frames.  Standard military batteries power the h andheld processor and sensors.  The outstation will also interface with organic communication equipment.  The day sensor system will capture and transmit still-frame color images to the base station when frame integration is turned off, with frame integrat ion turned on, monochrome images are acceptable.  The out station will provide digital compression and transmission of images.  It will be operable by soldiers in a field environment wearing cold weather equipment and/or Individual Protective Equipment (IP E) clothing.  The LVRS II shall also provide an interface to a National Television Systems Committee (NTSC) video in and video out sources.  The resident software shall be capable of manipulating, compressing, capturing, recording, and transmitting still f rame  and multi-frame images that will allow the base station operator to recognize a light vehicle with a probability of 70% out to a range of 1500 meters in daylight with a 7-kilometer visibility conditions.  The out station will not be acoustically detectabl e by unaided hearing at any range greater than 5 meters.  The base station consists of imagery compression/decompression and communications interface hardware, a monitor, and a color image printer.  The base station can be operated in a HMMWV, M577, or any  other shelter with a 115-volt alternating current (AC), 12-volt or 24-volt DC power supply source.  It will interface with organic communication equipment, retransmit to other base stations, and receive images from the outstation without any discernable l oss of resolution or image quality.  The base station will store multiple images capable of being selected and displayed on a video monitor.  In addition, it will record outstation spot and salute reports and symbology on the printed copy of the image or o n the retransmitted image.  The base station will not be acoustically detectable by unaided hearing at any range greater than 50 meters. This equipment is to be Non-Developmental Item (NDI) or NDI with minor modifications which include but are not limited to hardening for field and inclement weather use and Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI).  This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP).  Thi s request is limited to contractors currently manufacturing systems capable of providing a completely integrated LVRS II end-to-end working system.  No partial or developmental systems will be accepted. Potential integrators must submit technical informati on, in writing, no later than COB 19 Feb 2004, to Project Manager Soldier Sensors and Equipment; Product Manager Sensors and Lasers; ATTN: Jaime Gonzalez; 10107 Beach Rd / Bldg. 325; Fort Belvoir, Virginia 22060-5800.

All conceptual research, development and demonstration tasks described should be aimed at addressing or contributing to improvements in some or all of the areas of most concern expressed in the Tactic al Electric Power (TEP) Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for future power systems.  These include:  Utility Class Power Quality, AC and DC, as defined in MIL-STD-1332B; Reduced Fuel Consumption; Reduced Weight; Improved Reliability for  AC and DC se ts;  Reduced Acoustic Signature; and Lower Maintenance Ratio.  Present values for these characteristics include:  Operating Fuels:  DF-1, DF-2, JP-8; Maximum Fuel Consumption: 0.33 gph at rated load; Wet Weight: 138# for the 24 VDC set and 158# for the 120 volt, 60 Hz AC set; MTBEFF: 818/490 hrs, AC/DC sets; Noise: 79  dB(A) @ 7 meters; Maintenance Ratio: 0.041.  In all cases, simplicity, durability and ruggedness are desired characteristics of any modifications directed at product improvements.  Technologies with well defined approaches which are peripherally applicabl e to improving the current 2 kW MTG and/or to accelerating the research on the MTG successor will be considered.   Other generator system performance or operational characteristics and requirements which might be improved upon, but which can not acceptably be compromised, include:  Meet EMI requirements per MIL-STD-461; Operational Environment: -40 degrees Fahrenheit t o +120 degrees Fahrenheit, rain, humidity, altitude, sand/dust; rail transport; -65 degrees Fahrenheit cold storage; salt spray and fungus; Electric Power Rating: 2 kW, 1.0 pf @ 4000 ft and 120 degrees Fahrenheit, derate by 3.5%/1000 ft, max power rating a t 110% of nominal rating; and all Electric Power Quality requirements per MIL-STD-1332B.   Concepts which offer the prospect of direct retrofits to improve the current fleet are desired.  Investigations which will result in clear and significant benefits to the next generation MTG set in the areas of desired improvement listed above are also sou ght.  Investigations which, in the sole judgment of the government evaluators, offer only minor improvements or are considered unlikely to be affordably realizable will not be considered for further discussion or development. There is no funding nor are there any plans to apply the results of this R&D effort to the current production of the 2 kW MTG.   The DOD has no established plan to procure the 2 kW MTG beyond the existing production contract.   CERDEC is interested in obtaining brief white papers, not exceeding 10 pages, describing advanced R&D (6.5) technical approaches to provide product improvements to the currently fielded Army lightweight, man-portable, 2 kW military  tactical generator set (MTG).  White papers should address the ability of the proposed approach(es) to satisfy the operational and performance requirements outlined within this RFI and highlight the product improvements to be obtained upon successful impl ementation.  The white paper shall also describe the direct experience of the proposer with power generation systems in the classification of the DoD 2kW MTG, to include testing experience to DoD standards for tactical power requirements.  White papers sho uld describe the organizational capabilities of the proposer and should provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost to execute an R&D program along the lines of the approach (es) described.  The principal focus of the white paper shall be to identify and  describe relevant technical approach (es) to pursue R&D objectives that will provide product improvements to the currently fielded 2kW MTG and/or accelerate advances applicable to the next generation 2 kW Military Tactical Generator set. Because the appropriate technology and approach for a successor system has not yet been defined or determined, CERDEC is also interested in obtaining a second set of white papers, not exceeding 10 pages, describing advanced R&D (6.5) technical approaches t o developing the potential successor power system to the currently fielded 2kW MTG if considered to be different from the specific existing system above.  Alternative technological approaches, to include other electromechanical/electromagnetic converters, fuel cells, and other direct energy conversion means may be considered.  White papers should address the ability of any proposed technological approach to satisfy the operational and performance requirements outlined within this RFI.  The white paper shall  also describe the direct experience of the proposer with power generation systems in the classification of the DoD 2 kW MTG, to include testing experience to DoD standard tactical power requirements.  White papers should describe the organizational capabi lities of the proposer and should provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost to execute an R&D program along the lines of the approach (es) described. Funds have been authorized and appropriated for the R&D product improvement effort, however CERDEC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for information solicited herein.  The data received in response to the RFI is for information purposes only and does not mandate or impose requirements.  It is highly desirable that data be received with unlimited rights to the Government.  However, we recognize that proprietary data may be included with the information provided.

<SUBJECT>A -- Aerodynamic Efficiency Improvement (AEI) Program
<DESC>The United States Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is developing technologies to enable ultra-efficient high aspect ratio wings for the SensorCraft concept flight vehicle – an advanced ISR platform (See Reference 1).  The benefits derived from these technologies will reduce structural loads and improve vehicle lift-to-drag (L/D) minimizing vehicle weight and cost.  The High L/D Active (HiLDA) Wing program continues to investigate the merits of incremental improvements to the SensorCraft air vehicle via the incorporation of technology advancements achieved in the following AFRL research programs:  “Active Aeroelastic Wing” (AAW) – seeks to achieve aerodynamic efficiency at off-design conditions, provide a means of primary flight control, alleviate gust/maneuver loads, and provide aeroelastic response control; “Adaptive Structures” (AS) – provide aerodynamic wing shape tailoring, manage/alleviate structural loads; and “Active Flow Control” (AFC) – maintain wing laminar flow, prevent shock-induced boundary layer flow separation, reduce skin friction drag, and provide active flow separation control.  Information is being sought to further develop and mature SensorCraft wing aerodynamic and aeroelastic technologies ultimately validated through flight demonstrations.  The prospective candidates shall propose technologies sufficiently developed or exhibit applicability for further maturation including demonstration in a flight test program within the next 1-2 years.  Candidates themselves need not necessarily have prior experience in developmental flight test activities.

In addition to proposed technologies, candidate responses should include information regarding:  technical competency in terms of engineering and facilities; prior company technical experience in relation to the topic; collaboration with other research organization or agencies; and biographies of technical experts.  Technical point of contact for this activity is Dr. Ken Iwanski, AFRL/VAAA, 937-255-5147, kenneth.iwanski@wpafb.af.mil.  Contractual point of contact is Mr. Dennis Strobel, Contract Negotiator, AFRL/VAK, 937-656-9617, dennis.strobel@wpafb.af.mil.  Please respond by close of business            05 March 2004.  Responses should be submitted to Dennis Strobel, AFRL/VAK, 2310 8th Street, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH 45433-7801.  Responses are to be limited to five (5) pages, with the preferred option being an electronic submission (MS Word or Adobe PDF file).  All routine communication concerning this acquisition should also be directed to the aforementioned Mr. Strobel.

Statement of Work Islamic Services Life Connections Program

A. BACKGROUND
In September 2000, the Executive Staff of the Federal Bureau of Prisons approved a concept which would initiate a pilot program of multi faith Residential Life Connections Pre-release Program. This is a voluntary program which will initially be located in five institutions in various regions of the country. The program will be available to men and women inmates.

The program provides inmates with intensive opportunities for spiritual growth and deepening their religious roots by sharing common space and programs for the purpose of personal transformation and reducing recidivism. Inmates will participate in religion specific and inter faith program components designed to bring restoration with God, family, community, and self. The program’s design will increase religious tolerance and respect among inmates of various faiths; will connect each inmate with a spiritual mentor; and will link participants with a faith community at their release destination in order to enhance community reintegration. Another component of the program will initiate specific Victim Impact programs to assist inmates in claiming responsibility for their actions and making amends with victims, family, and community.

The program will enlist partnerships with individuals and organizations in its efforts to lower recidivism and facilitate spiritual growth and personal change. Volunteers, contractors, mentors, sponsoring religious congregations and organizations are all essential partners in the program.

The goal of the Bureau of Prisons Residential Life Connections Pre-release Program is to provide inmates living in a shared living space with intensive opportunities for holistic life restoration for the purpose of reducing recidivism and enhancing prison management.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation DTCG85-04-Q-625370 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is small business set-aside procurement.  The NAICS Code is 333612. The small business size standard is 1,000. This is an unrestricted procurement.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.
