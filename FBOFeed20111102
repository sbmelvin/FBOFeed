In accordance with FAR 5.207 (c) (15) (ii); all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
Based upon market research, the Government will be using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Qualification Requirements:  Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.  
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br />The COAC Services Branch, Office of Acquisitions, DERA, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH, for the Cardiovascular - Pulmonary Branch (CPB), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Toshiba America Medical systems, Inc., 2441 Michelle Drive, Tustin, California 92780, for the continuation of Leasing and maintaining the Toshiba Cardiovascular Computer Tomography Imaging Scanner services as outline below
<p>The reference number: NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2012-017-DDC.<br /><br />Background<br />The Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics has taken a leading role in developing advanced cardiac imaging methods, noninvasive physiological studies, and minimally invasive interventional procedures. This work has included some of the first demonstrations of functional brain imaging, discovery of magnetization transfer contrast in NMR experiments, development and validation of new MR imaging methods, use of NMR and optical spectroscopy to study in vivo physiology, invention of novel two photon optical microscopy methods, and study of some of the first uses of MRI to guide intravascular catheter-based procedures and robotic surgery. The Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics is staffed by a large team of physiologists, engineers, physicists, and physicians spanning a wide range of interests ranging from subcellular metabolism to human diagnostic imaging and catheter-based interventions. <br />Computed Tomography is an x-ray based technology that produces noninvasive cross-sectional images of the body. The advent of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scanners enabled acquisition of high resolution 3-dimensional images of the body when married with helical scan methods. The value of the resulting high resolution images has been recognized by many groups around the world as providing high enough resolution images to diagnose coronary artery stenosis in patients. This methodology is useful in a wide range of cardiovascular applications including noninvasive angiography, imaging heart valves and the pericardium. One disadvantage of current generation MDCT scanners is the limited spatial coverage of the detectors. Typically, 64-detector scanners cover 4 or less cm along the axial direction of the body. To produce the highest quality images of the body, helical scanning modes are used which frequently use 80% overlap between each rotation to guarantee adequate spatial coverage and minimize image artifacts. This increases radiation exposure and reduces temporal efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:<br />This equipment will support pre-clinical and clinical research using high resolution CT scans to study myocardial perfusion, myocardial viability, coronary calcium, coronary artery stenosis, catheter-based interventions, and robotic surgery.<br />NHLBI is interested in soliciting capability statements from all qualified Offerors demonstrating their ability to perform this effort. At a minimum, prospective Offerors must document capabilities in the following areas:<br />1. Competence and experience in the operation and maintenance of 256-row MDCT Cardiovascular Computer Tomography Imaging Scanner<br />Provide certification in order to lease a Toshiba 256-row MDCT Cardiovascular Computer Tomography Imaging Scanner and to maintain the system</p>
<p>Anticipated period of Performance: December 30, 2011 through October 29, 2012, for period not to exceed 10 months.</p>
<p>Services to be Performed<br />General Requirements<br />Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services and perform the work set forth below.</p>
<p>All work under this contract shall be monitored by the Project Officer, whose position is defined elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>Specific Requirements<br />The contractor shall be responsible providing maintenance for a MDCT scanner.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact Toshiba America Medical Systems, Inc.'s 256-detector CT scanner supports many existing research projects in the laboratory and enhances this research by providing high-resolution 3-dimensional images of the heart and vascular tree. The images that have been captured by the Toshiba Scanner provide methods for assessing myocardial perfusion, myocardial viability, coronary artery disease, intravascular interventional procedures, and robotic surgery. In order to complete these studies the Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics must continue to use the equipment that provides this technology. Therefore, it is in the best interest for the Government to negotiate with the manufacturer Toshiba America Medical Systems, Inc., for continuing services.</p>
<p>The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br /><br />Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with size standard of 500 employees; the small business set-aside does not apply for this requirement.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition <br />procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-53 (August 4, 2011).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by November 9, 2011, 7:30 am Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue contract modifications to contract N00019-07-C-0055 on a sole source basis with Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, San Diego, CA to test previously developed software on the X-47B Unmanned Combat Air System (UCAS) in order to continue the efforts to demonstrate hybrid probe/drogue United States Navy (USN) and boom/receptacle United States Air Force (USAF) style autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) as part of the UCAS Demonstration Program by CY 2014. Current UCAS-D efforts include demonstrating critical technologies for an unmanned, carrier suitable, tailless, low observable (LO) platform in a carrier relevant environment. The product from this developmental test effort is the technical data to assess system performance, determine viability of the AAR concept, and support the further development of future unmanned systems. Upgrades to existing UCAS-D X-47B software will be developed and tested for the AAR capability within the existing architecture and interface with proprietary vehicle management control software. <br /><br />The UCAS-D X-47B air vehicle is the only relevant carrier-suitable unmanned air system in existence capable of demonstrating AAR in the near-term. Moreover, the X-47B hardware was recently re-designed and modified to accommodate both USN-style and USAF-style refueling. The physical hardware and electronic interfaces required to perform AAR are now ready for testing. These electronic interfaces, however, are proprietary to NGSC, as the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the X-47B. As such, NGSC is the only responsible source with the requisite knowledge, technical expertise and experience capable of satisfying the Government's data needs by CY 2014 within the allocated budget. <br /><br />Unless otherwise stated herein, no formal request for proposal or additional written information is available. Request for same will be disregarded. A determination by the Government not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. This synopsis is published for informative purposes (THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Introduction:
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research was established in 1989. Its reauthorizing legislation (42 U.S.C. 299 et seq; "Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999") renamed it the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and established it as the lead Federal agency whose mission was to enhance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health services and access to such services for all Americans. AHRQ's mission is to produce "measurable improvements in health care in America, gauged in terms of improved quality of life and patient outcomes, lives saved, and value gained for what we spend." Under the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999 (S 580), which reauthorized AHRQ, AHRQ's reauthorizing legislation stated that, "The Agency shall promote health care quality improvement by conducting and supporting- (1) research that develops and presents scientific evidence regarding all aspects of health care, including- (2) methods for measuring quality and strategies for improving quality; and (3) initiatives to advance private and public efforts to improve health care quality." (cite http://www.ahrq.gov/hrqa99a.htm)</p>
<p>To achieve its mission, the Agency conducts and supports a broad base of scientific research and promotes improvements in clinical and health system practices, including the prevention of diseases and other health conditions. AHRQ sponsors and conducts research that develops and presents evidence-based information on healthcare outcomes, quality, comparative effectiveness, patient safety, cost, use and access. Included in AHRQ's mandate is support of the generation, synthesis, and dissemination of scientific evidence, including effectiveness research and analytic methods.</p>
<p>In particular, AHRQ was designated by the Secretary to implement and administer the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act. The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (Patient Safety Act), and its regulations (the Patient Safety Rule) authorized the creation of Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs), which collect, aggregate, and analyze confidential and privileged information regarding the quality and safety of healthcare. The goals of the Patient Safety Act are to encourage the expansion of voluntary, provider-driven initiatives to improve the quality and safety of health care; to promote rapid learning about the underlying causes of risks and harms in the delivery of health care; and, to share those findings widely, thus, speeding the pace of improvement. The Patient Safety Act also authorizes the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to facilitate the development of a Network of Patient Safety Databases (NPSD), to which PSOs can voluntarily contribute non-identifiable patient safety event information. The NPSD will receive and report on non-identifiable, aggregated patient safety event information which will be included in AHRQ's annual National Healthcare Quality Report and National Healthcare Disparities Report (NHQR and NHDR). AHRQ understood the complexity of ensuring that information submitted to the NPSD was non-identifiable and the costs associated with adherence to the confidentiality provisions of the Patient Safety Rule. Therefore, AHRQ established the PSO Privacy Protection Center (PSOPPC) to assist PSOs and others with meeting the requirement that patient safety event information be made non-identifiable prior to sending to the NPSD. The PSOPPC will receive patient safety information in a standardized format (AHRQ Common Formats) and render it non-identifiable before transmitting it safely and efficiently to the NPSD.</p>
<p>The Patient Safety Rule requires PSOs, to the extent practical and appropriate, to collect patient safety event data from providers in a standardized manner. AHRQ's common definitions, data elements, and reporting formats are known as Common Formats. The PSOPPC only accepts data represented as AHRQ's Common Formats. The PSO also delivers technical assistance to PSOs on the use of AHRQ's Common Formats.</p>
<p>The Common Formats include event descriptions, specifications for patient safety aggregate reports, delineation of data elements to be collected for different types of events, and technical specifications for electronic data collection and reporting. The technical specifications promote standardization of collected patient safety event information by stipulating rules for data collection and submission. The PSOPPC maintains the Common Formats and the technical specifications. The Common Formats and the associated technical specifications are available on the PSOPPC Web Site (www.psoppc.org).</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The main requirement of this contract is to provide guidance to PSOs with using the Common Formats and rendering patient safety event information non-identifiable. The PSOPPC will contract with PSOs to receive patient safety and quality data and to render patient safety work product non-identifiable and compliant with requirements of the Patient Safety Rule (Section 3.212), then transferring the data securely and efficiently to the NPSD.</p>
<p>Specific objectives of this contract are to:</p>
<p>1 Maintain PSOPPC operations<br />2 Develop and maintain PSO PPC website and databases for receipt, analysis, and development of non-identifiable data, archive, storage, and access to data by PSOs<br />3 Receive information on patient safety events from PSOs <br />4 Apply protocols for rendering patient safety events non-identifiable<br />5 Transfer non-identifiable information of patient safety events to the NPSD<br />6 Provide technical assistance to PSOs, including training<br />7 Coordinate and conduct the PSO Annual Meeting, AHRQ Common Formats Software Developer's Meeting and PSO Quarterly Conference Calls</p>
<p>Firms should have the capability to develop large scale databases for patient safety and healthcare quality data; experience with development of standardized definitions, data elements and reporting formats for patient safety event reporting; statistical analysis expertise in non-identification methods; logistical support for meetings of up to 300 attendees; and the ability to receive, process, and maintain data at FIPS category moderate.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p>AHRQ is seeking qualified firms able to optimize their technical and management resources, creativity and flexibility to achieve Agency goals.

<DESC>Introduction:
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research was established in 1989. Its reauthorizing legislation (42 U.S.C. 299 et seq; "Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999") renamed it the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and established it as the lead Federal agency whose mission was to enhance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health services and access to such services for all Americans. AHRQ's mission is to produce "measurable improvements in health care in America, gauged in terms of improved quality of life and patient outcomes, lives saved, and value gained for what we spend." Under the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999 (S 580), which reauthorized AHRQ, AHRQ's reauthorizing legislation stated that, "The Agency shall promote health care quality improvement by conducting and supporting- (1) research that develops and presents scientific evidence regarding all aspects of health care, including- (2) methods for measuring quality and strategies for improving quality; and (3) initiatives to advance private and public efforts to improve health care quality." (cite http://www.ahrq.gov/hrqa99a.htm)</p>
<p>To achieve its mission, the Agency conducts and supports a broad base of scientific research and promotes improvements in clinical and health system practices, including the prevention of diseases and other health conditions. AHRQ sponsors and conducts research that develops and presents evidence-based information on healthcare outcomes, quality, comparative effectiveness, patient safety, cost, use and access. Included in AHRQ's mandate is support of the generation, synthesis, and dissemination of scientific evidence, including effectiveness research and analytic methods.</p>
<p>In particular, AHRQ was designated by the Secretary to implement and administer the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act. The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (Patient Safety Act), and its regulations (the Patient Safety Rule) authorized the creation of Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs), which collect, aggregate, and analyze confidential and privileged information regarding the quality and safety of healthcare. The goals of the Patient Safety Act are to encourage the expansion of voluntary, provider-driven initiatives to improve the quality and safety of health care; to promote rapid learning about the underlying causes of risks and harms in the delivery of health care; and, to share those findings widely, thus, speeding the pace of improvement. The Patient Safety Act also authorizes the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to facilitate the development of a Network of Patient Safety Databases (NPSD), to which PSOs can voluntarily contribute non-identifiable patient safety event information. The NPSD will receive and report on non-identifiable, aggregated patient safety event information which will be included in AHRQ's annual National Healthcare Quality Report and National Healthcare Disparities Report (NHQR and NHDR). AHRQ understood the complexity of ensuring that information submitted to the NPSD was non-identifiable and the costs associated with adherence to the confidentiality provisions of the Patient Safety Rule. Therefore, AHRQ established the PSO Privacy Protection Center (PSOPPC) to assist PSOs and others with meeting the requirement that patient safety event information be made non-identifiable prior to sending to the NPSD. The PSOPPC will receive patient safety information in a standardized format (AHRQ Common Formats) and render it non-identifiable before transmitting it safely and efficiently to the NPSD.</p>
<p>The Patient Safety Rule requires PSOs, to the extent practical and appropriate, to collect patient safety event data from providers in a standardized manner. AHRQ's common definitions, data elements, and reporting formats are known as Common Formats. The PSOPPC only accepts data represented as AHRQ's Common Formats. The PSO also delivers technical assistance to PSOs on the use of AHRQ's Common Formats.</p>
<p>The Common Formats include event descriptions, specifications for patient safety aggregate reports, delineation of data elements to be collected for different types of events, and technical specifications for electronic data collection and reporting. The technical specifications promote standardization of collected patient safety event information by stipulating rules for data collection and submission. The PSOPPC maintains the Common Formats and the technical specifications. The Common Formats and the associated technical specifications are available on the PSOPPC Web Site (www.psoppc.org).</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The main requirement of this contract is to provide guidance to PSOs with using the Common Formats and rendering patient safety event information non-identifiable. The PSOPPC will contract with PSOs to receive patient safety and quality data and to render patient safety work product non-identifiable and compliant with requirements of the Patient Safety Rule (Section 3.212), then transferring the data securely and efficiently to the NPSD.</p>
<p>Specific objectives of this contract are to:</p>
<p>1 Maintain PSOPPC operations<br />2 Develop and maintain PSO PPC website and databases for receipt, analysis, and development of non-identifiable data, archive, storage, and access to data by PSOs<br />3 Receive information on patient safety events from PSOs <br />4 Apply protocols for rendering patient safety events non-identifiable<br />5 Transfer non-identifiable information of patient safety events to the NPSD<br />6 Provide technical assistance to PSOs, including training<br />7 Coordinate and conduct the PSO Annual Meeting, AHRQ Common Formats Software Developer's Meeting and PSO Quarterly Conference Calls</p>
<p>Firms should have the capability to develop large scale databases for patient safety and healthcare quality data; experience with development of standardized definitions, data elements and reporting formats for patient safety event reporting; statistical analysis expertise in non-identification methods; logistical support for meetings of up to 300 attendees; and the ability to receive, process, and maintain data at FIPS category moderate.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>

Qualified firms must demonstrate substantial experience with development of large scale databases for patient safety and healthcare quality data; development of standardized definitions, data elements and reporting formats for patient safety event reporting; statistical analysis expertise in non-identification methods; logistical support for meetings of up to 300 attendees; and the ability to receive, process, and maintain data at FIPS category moderate.

<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted legal principles and theories. In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management. The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies. The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.</p>
<p>Complexity</p>
<p>Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. military and the Government of Afghanistan can be complicated.</p>
<p>Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact other programs. They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.</p>
<p>Physical Demands</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the work is principally sedentary, however frequent travel in and around, or being stationed in Afghanistan provinces, is likely. While on a site visit there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances - the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Extended onsite visits to remote project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also often a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty,windy, and polluted environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty or polluted environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.<br />Period of Performance - The period of performance for this order will be one year from the date of award with the option to renew.</p>

<DESC>Project PRA-GWMP 11(5)<br />Arlington Memorial Bridge Bascule Span Repairs
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION STATEMENT (RFI): DTFH71-12-I-00001</p>
<p>A bridge safety inspection team under the direction of the Federal Highway Administration performed an in-depth inspection on the bascule span of the Arlington Memorial Bridge in May 2011. By re-calculating the vehicle load capacity, the bridge was found to be structurally adequate for state legal loads without any weight restrictions.</p>
<p>Even though the load carrying capacity is still adequate, it is slightly lower than the calculated capacity based on the previous in-depth inspection report (October 2009) due to ongoing corrosion of the steel members. Items on the bascule span will require attention before they become critical and affect the load carrying capacity of the structure. The following is the statement of work to address these immediate concerns.</p>
<p>1- The bearing seat along the edge of both bascule span abutments has areas of moderate to severe spalling and delamination (see Photos 1 &amp; 2). Place shim plates between all steel stringers and the counterweights. In addition, existing support columns under counterweights also have severe section loss. Repair these columns by attaching new base plates and grouting concrete contact areas to transfer loads from these stringers to the foundation areas.</p>
<p>2- Several curb stringers including stringer trusses that support a portion of the right lanes (both inbound and outbound right lanes), are exhibiting moderate to severe section loss which has increased since the last inspection due to the ongoing corrosion (see Photos 3 &amp; 4). Repair existing stringer beams by bolting new angles and plates to the existing stringer beams. In addition, replace tension members on two (2) truss stringers also located along right lanes just under the curb line. This will require temporary works to relieve stresses during replacement of truss members.</p>
<p>This work will require lane and sidewalk closures. Closures will be limited to non rush hour times and weekends. Attached drawings of repairs and falsework may be revised from comments received from contractors involved in the RFI process. Attached drawings are considered preliminary design.</p>
<p>A site visit is scheduled for November 17, 2011 at 9:00 am all participants are required to have hard hats, vests and flash lights and should be aware of hazardous site conditions. We will meet near the traffic circle on the Virginia side. Contractors interested in attending a site visit should register by 12:00 pm on November 15, 2011, and will be notified if the Government needs to schedule multiple site entry due to the confined area of the bridge. If contractors do not pre-register for the site visit they will not be allowed access to the site. Contractors are limited to two (2) attendees, names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses are required for each attendee. Contractors are expected to have the following Qualifications/Experience: experience on two (2) contracts within the past five (5) years performing technically the same or similar design and construction work, including experience on structural steel repairs in confined areas located on high steel that may require rigging. Additionally, the Contractor is expected to have experience on bridge truss member replacements and/or rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Please email Ms. Peggy Schaad, Contract Specialist at eflhd.contracts@dot.gov. We request written comments and capability statement from contractors by November 30, 2011before 2:00 pm EST. <br />Delivered to:<br />Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division<br />ATTN: Peggy Schaad<br />21400 Ridgetop Circle<br />Sterling, VA 20166-6511</p>

<DESC>Yellowstone National Park is annoucing it's intent to sole source award to Telonics, Inc.
Any vendors comments should  be submitted in writing via email to Andrea_Hannon@nps.gov
The Bison Ecology and Management Program uses Global Position System transmitting units to track individual bison during the course of monitoring both population and disease dynamics in Yellowstone bison.  In order to continue the long term monitoring of Yellowstone bison we routinely refurbish previously deployed GPS collars when the battery life has been exhausted and the webbing needs to be replaced.  
In previous years the Bison Ecology and Management Office has contacted other telemetry equipment companies to request price quotes to refurbish this equipment.  We were unable to find a company that would rebuild equipment not manufactured by their employees.  This same process of requesting quotes from other telemetry companies was also conducted by the procurement office and the same result occurred.  No company is available to rebuild this equipment other than the original manufacturer.  
The collars will be refurbished using the following specifications:Inspect and replace if necessary the store on board data collection deviceProgram the refurbished equipment to collect one GPS location every 2 hoursRefurbish the equipment to collects GPS data for a minimum of 2 yearsInspect and replace if necessary the Mortality Switch.  Ensure the refurbished equipment will activate the mortality switch after 6 hours of inactivity at greater than 60  beats per minute (to be negotiated with company technicians to determine a compromise rate that does not unduely consume power from the battery)Inspect and replace if necessary the Activity Sensor and ensure that the refurbished equipment is programmed to collect data at 10 minute intervals throughout the data collection life of the equipment.  Also, ensure the Tip Switch functions at +5 degrees, head to tailInspect and replace if necessary the Temperature Sensing deviceReplace black webbing in order for the GPS antenna to function when webbing length is adjusted to 38-42"The black webbing material should be constructed of Heavy duty neck collar material sufficient to stay on an adult female bisonEnsure that the refurbished equipment emits a VHF pulse at 40 beats per minute.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH NOTICE

T700 Commercial Depot for Navy H-60 Sea Hawk and Marine Corp H-1 Cobra and Huey Aircraft Fleet

Naval Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) is in the beginning stages of forming an Acquisition Strategy and seeking potential sources, which may be interested in a follow-on requirement for Standard Depot Level Rework of T700-GE-401/401C Turbo Shaft Engines, Cold Section Modules (CSM), and Power Turbine Modules (PTM) for the Navy H-60 Sea Hawk and Marine Corps H-1 Cobra and Huey aircraft.  The required support provides services of repair, rework, and testing of the T700-GE-401 and T700-GE-401C engines in accordance with the T700 Depot Maintenance Work Requirement (DMWR).
  The T700-GE-401 and T700-GE-401C engines are installed and operated on the Navys H-60 Sea Hawk aircraft and the Marine Corps H-1 Cobra Attack and Huey Utility helicopters.  The Navy H-60s are utilized ashore and aboard naval ships conducting Anti-Submarine Warfare, Mine Counter Measures, Search and Rescue, as well as underway replenishment.  Both Navy and Marine Corps helicopters have been used extensively in Afghanistan and Iraq in direct support of the Global War on Terrorism.  Currently, Navy H-60 aircraft are also conducting Air Ambulance missions in Iraq.  In times of natural disasters, the Navy H-60 and the Marine Corps H-1 Huey aircraft are often utilized in relief efforts both at home and abroad.
  A recent example was in support of Japan following the tsunami where both Navy H-60 and Marine Corps H-1 aircraft were utilized for disaster relief efforts.  Additionally, the Navy supported Southern California firefighters battling wildfires, where all variants of the Navy H-60 aircraft were used to deliver water/supplies, in addition to providing aerial infrared detection of forest fire hot spots.

Due to the mission-critical requirements, rigorous performance and acceptance testing of the T700-GE-401/401C engines, CSMs and PTMs will be required.  Only the most experienced commercial sources can reliably provide and sustain the rework, repair, and testing that is required.  Logically, the time to develop another source or outsourcing to foreign companies of this mission critical work would result in unacceptable delay of engine, CSM, and PTM repairs and negatively impact a critical shortfall of operational T700 engines.
  The aircraft requirement is to be available to deploy or be currently deployed world wide 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year.  This level of sustained readiness can only be accomplished and maintained by a highly skilled and trained team of motivated civilian, contractor and military personnel.  

The Navy and Marine Corps H-60 and H-1 aircraft employ highly flexible weapon system platforms.  All are capable of taking the fight to the enemy, retrieving downed aviators behind enemy lines, and supply food/water during times of war or national emergency.  Not unlike the military, civilian and contractor personnel must be a highly cohesive and well-trained team due to the myriad of support roles.
  The loss of crucial repair support would result in reduced aircraft readiness, engine reliability and availability of serviceable engines ready for installation.  This negative impact would result in aircraft bare firewalls and increased shortages of major components due to decreased engine reliability.  

For these reasons, it is imperative that contracted engine repair facilities continue to sustain the highest level of excellence as previously demonstrated.  These facilities must also have all required support equipment, current test cells, and parts access needed to repair T700-GE-401/401C engines and modules.  The contractor should have extensive experience in repair, testing, and acceptance of the T700-GE-401/401C engines and modules.
  

The intent is to provide cost-effective, on-time availability of Ready-For-Issue (RFI) Navy and Marine Corps T700-GE-401/401C Engines, CSMs, and PTMs to meet National Military Strategy.  Because of the criticality of these engines and modules it is mandatory that any interested parties be a NAVAIR approved source of repair IAW the Joint Aeronautical Commanders Group (JACG) Aviation Source Approval and Management Handbook dated 16Mar2011 and Secretary of the Navy Instruction 4140.2.  Because of the criticality of these engines and modules it is mandatory that any interested parties must have already been granted a NAVAIR source approval letter.  The time required for qualification of new suppliers is a minimum of 8 to 10 months, and award cannot be delayed pending qualification of a new source.
  In addition, the contractor shall be required to be a certified Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) CT-7 repair station and meet all OEM specifications.

Source approval requirements and processes addressed in the JACG Handbook are not intended to restrict competition, but rather to ensure that proposed sources are capable of consistently producing acceptable items while increasing competition for manufacturing source approved items in addition to the repair, overhaul, maintenance and modification of items.  Any other interested parties are encouraged to submit source approval requests for consideration of future contract awards.  

A draft Statement of Work (SOW) for this requirement is attached to this notice.
  

The Government is contemplating utilizing a competitive, commercial, performance-based, single award Indefinite/Delivery Indefinite/Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle.  The period of performance is five years to be awarded December 2012.  

Responses to this notice should provide, at a minimum, a rough order of magnitude (ROM) price, a narrative identifying the scope of past and present (within the last 3 years) relevant experience on similar contracts, indicating if it was in the U.S.A. or in a foreign country (include dollar value, complexity and point of contact), a description of capabilities to perform the subject effort, any comments on the draft SOW, and any alternative approaches to filling the subject requirement.
  Potential sources must identify their business type (i.e., small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) certified business, woman-owned business, etc).  For purposes of reporting business size, the applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 488190 with a size standard of $7.0 million.  Brevity of extraneous information is desired.  

Information should be sent via e-mail to Jessica.Roach@navy.mil.  Alternative submittal methods are via facsimile to (407) 380-4164 Attn: Code 25311 (J. Roach) or by mail to:  NAWCTSD, ATTN:  Code 25311 (J. Roach), 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826-3275.  Responses are requested by 17 November 2011.
  The submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any services, or for the Government to pay for the information received.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  Technical questions concerning this requirement should be directed to the Program Manager, LCDR Doug Peters via email at douglas.peters@navy.mil or by telephone at (301) 757-5141.  All other questions should be directed to Contract Specialist, Jessica Roach, via email at Jessica.Roach@navy.mil or by telephone at (407) 380-8112.

<DESC>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 requires the Government to conduct market research before developing new requirements documents for an acquisition.  Results of market research are used to determine whether qualified sources exist and whether commercial items are available to meet the requirement.

One of the ways the Government conducts market research is to issue a Request for Information (RFI).  A RFI provides a broad statement of need, briefly describes the Governments intention regarding program/acquisition approach, and identifies key events in the acquisition program schedule.  

Description
This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes, as part of a market survey on services for Maintenance and Repair Support of MMP-30 Robots.
  It is not a Request for Proposal.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.

Background
The Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) community has a need to maintain properly balanced sources to supply for meeting depot repair requirements in support of MMP-30 Robots.  Since the MMP-30 robot is used by the EOD community to combat improvised explosive devices (IED), the Government must maintain its ability to repair these robots.  Therefore, the Government is in need of maintenance and Modular Test Stations (MTS) for the MMP-30 Robots.  

Requested Information
The respondent is requested to provide information on the following:
(a)	Depot Operating Procedures
(b)	Depot Safety Program.
(c)	Detailed Materials List, Part and Consumables along with sources and plan for procurement.
(d)	Determination of any proprietary issues and their proposed resolution.
  
(e)	Detailed Tool & Equipment List 

Response Format
Interested parties who believe they are capable of for filling this requirement are invited to indicate their interest by providing; (a) company name, company address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), cage code, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number; and (b) business size and unique qualifiers (e.g. large, foreign, small disadvantaged, veteran owned, woman owned, etc.)

Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI in Microsoft Word for Office 2007  compatible format.  RFI responses are limited to 15 pages, including cover and administrative pages.  Response documents shall be written using a 10 point font size or larger.

The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.
 1905 to protect information qualifying as confidential under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any proprietary (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:

1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) proprietary with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.

2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as proprietary may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 3 below).
 Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.

3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.

4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the proprietary legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.
 Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends proprietary portion begins: and proprietary portion ends.

Response Deadline and Submissions
Responses are requested no later than Nov 30, 2011 at 1200 EST.  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail only to Mr. Joseph Loersch at joseph.loersch@navy.mil.   

Questions may be submitted until Nov 15, 2011.  All questions will be consolidated and published in an amendment to this RFI Request.  Questions should be submitted in writing to Mr. Joseph Loersch at joseph.loersch@navy.mil. TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE HONORED.
Again, this information is being requested for market research only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement.
 This is not a Request for Proposals. The Government will not award a contract based upon responses to this announcement. The Government shall not reimburse or pay any costs for preparing or submitting information in response to this notic

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Computational Center for Toxicology (NCCT), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, is interested in evaluating whether the approach of using biochemical and cellular assays to define activity of compounds against specific protein targets can be used to build methods prioritizing compounds for additional screening and testing based on predicted hazard and potential toxicity.  The EPA requires a Contractor to use a broad panel of assays, biochemical or cellular, encompassing a wide range of protein families when performing these services.  Proposed assays shall address specific protein targets.  A DRAFT Performance Work Statement
for this requirement is available at the EPA RTP Procurement website:   http:// www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/.  Interested parties who can provide this requirement may submit a response to the following questions with a written qualification/capability statement no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  1. Does your firm provide these assays and/or services to other customers?  2. Is your firm considered a small business, large business, non-profit, or other (specify)?  3. Which of the following statements accurately describe your firm (select all that apply)?  a. 500 or fewer employees; b. 501 or more employees; c. Up to $12.0 million average annual receipts for the past 3 years; d. More than $12.0 million average 
revenue; e. Veteran-owned business (specify if Vietnam era or Service Disabled); f. Women-owned; g. Minority-owned.  4. Would your firm be interested in participating in a competitive acquisition for this requirement? If so, please provide contact information. The intent of this sources sought notice is to determine if any small business(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFP) is available.  The NAICS Code 541711 with a small business size standard of 500 employees is applicable. Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFP will not be honored.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Computational Center for Toxicology (NCCT), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, is interested in continuing its evaluation of whether the approach of using cellular assays to define activity of compounds against a broad spectrum of transcription factor targets can be used to build methods prioritizing compounds for additional screening and testing based on predicted hazard and potential toxicity.  The EPA requires a Contractor to use technologies aimed at profiling, in a multiplexed fashion, transcription factor activity in combination with varying cell lines and cell culture conditions when performing these
services.  Proposed assays may be either mono-or co-culture system, but each proposed assay shall address multiple transcriptional factor targets within a single well. A DRAFT Performance Work Statement for this requirement is available at the EPA RTP Procurement website:   http:// www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/.  Interested parties who can provide this requirement may submit a response to the following questions with a written qualification/capability statement no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  1.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will host three (3) Industry Days in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation for Patient-Centered Community Care (PCCC).  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS EVENT. This announcement serves as a notice and invitation to participate in this vendor event and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The purpose of the Industry Days is to provide general information on the upcoming solicitation and requirements and to solicit industry feedback. The Industry Days are open to all potential offerors interested in responding to the upcoming solicitation. The locations and dates are listed below. Attendance is voluntary and is not required in order to propose to future solicitations.
OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE:
The VA intends to contract with qualified providers to provide Patient-Centered Community Care (PCCC) across the nation to include all medical and surgical services excluding primary care, dialysis and mental health.  PCCC is intended to provide Veterans coordinated, timely access to high quality care from a comprehensive network of VA and non-VA providers.  Through contractual agreements, VA will enhance opportunities for collaboration with non-VA providers. The contracts will ensure Veterans receive coordinated, evidence-based care through non-VA providers when VA facilities are not able to provide needed specialty care. The contracts will be available for all VA Medical Centers throughout the Veterans Health Administration and will be centrally supported by the VHA Chief Business Office.

<DESC>I. SUMMARY<br><br>In accordance with FAR 15.201(c), the Army's Aviation Applied Technology Directorate announces an industry conference in support of a planned Joint Multi-Role (JMR) Technology Demonstrator (TD) program.  It is clear that the capabilities demanded of the Department of Defense (DoD) future rotorcraft fleet cannot be achieved through incremental upgrades to the current fleet.  As a result, the DoD has described the need for a JMR family of vertical lift aircraft that includes multiple sizes/classes of vehicles, addresses the vertical lift needs across the DoD, and achieves significant commonality between platforms.  The desired vehicle attributes of the JMR family include:  a scalable common core architecture, integrated aircraft survivability, speed of 170+ kts, a combat radius 424 km, vehicle performance at 6K/95 F, shipboard compatibility, improved fuel efficiency, improved supportability and affordability, optionally manned capability, and commonality.  To prepare the DoD for decisions regarding the potential replacement of current fleet aircraft with new build systems, the DoD has proposed a JMR TD effort that will demonstrate air vehicle and mission systems technologies for the next generation rotary wing fleet.  <br><br>This industry conference is anticipated to be an all day event focused on updating Industry with the current status of the JMR TD program with a primary focus toward soliciting feedback on the Government's evolving plans for the Mission Systems Demonstration phase of the program. This industry conference is led by the JMR TD Program Manager and is to be an informational exchange with industry. This is NOT a Request for Proposals. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.

Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-0889<br />Name: Protector, Document, 7-hole, Medium Weight, Clear, 8-1/2x11"<br />Description: The transparent document sheet protectors guard important paperwork against accidental spills or tears. The medium weight document protector is for 8-1/2"x11" documents. 7-hole punched for 3 ring or 7 ring binder use. Made using 40% post-consumer waste materials. UOI is BX. BX = 50 sheet protectors.</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-0890<br />Name: Protector, Document, 7-hole, Heavy Weight, Clear, 8-1/2"x11"<br />Description: The transparent document sheet protectors guard important paperwork against accidental spills or tears. The heavy weight document protector is for 8-1/2"x11" documents. 7-hole punched for 3 ring or 7 ring binder use. Made using 40% post-consumer waste materials. UOI is BX. BX = 50 sheet protectors.</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-1882<br />Name: Folders, Project, 8-1/2"x11", Clear<br />Description: The project folders guard important paperwork against accidental spills or tears. The project folder is a plastic sleeve, sealed on two sides, to keep loose papers organized. A notch in the front allows quick removal of documents. The project folder is for 8-1/2"x11" documents. Made using 40% post-consumer waste materials. UOI is BX. BX = 24 project folders.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-0889<br />Similar Items: 7510-01-347-9580, DP9580, FE-50</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-0890<br />Similar Items: 7510-01-347-9579, HFE-50, DP9579</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-1882<br />Similar Items: CLI 62127, AVE 72611, UNV 81525</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 18, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<p>The biotech industry aims to move towards an on-chip system for sample generation, amplification and detection of both DNA and RNA based organisms. LLNL has invented a new way of isolating samples in a system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This invention enables creation of partitioned fluid "packets" between polymeric sheets for chemical separation, DNA amplification or PCR-based DNA detection. The polymeric films containing the fluid would be sealed upon application of heat and further partitioned into individual microliter or picoliter samples. This approach would allow a continuous flow of samples through the system and minimize reaction and processing times.</p>

<CONTACT>Kimberly Pringle, Phone 301-496-6546, Fax 301-402-0642, Email kp271m@nih.gov
<DESC>The procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures according to FAR Part 13.5. Also, this is a commercial item so FAR Part 12.6 is applicable as well. It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP) to award on a sole source basis to DeLima and Associates of McLean, Virginia for the purchase of a non-exclusive license. The specific license numbers are CPID12000, CPID13000 and CPID14000 for use of DeLima Associates' proprietary Consumer Product Information Database (CPID) to be hosted on the National Library of Medicine's Household Products Database web site. (No funds will be used to develop a database.)
<p>The CPID was developed by, is maintained by, and is fully owned by DeLima Associates with no database development or maintenance funds provided by NIH except for the cost of a license for non-commercial use under certain terms and conditions.</p>
<p>CPID is a commercially available database that provides chemical ingredient and health effects information for over 11,000 brand name automotive, personal care, home maintenance, inside home, pet care, pesticide, hobby and crafts, home office and landscape and yard products. <br /><br />JUSTIFICATION<br />Language provided from SBA SBIR policy directive...<br />(7) For Phase III, Congress intends that agencies or their Government owned,<br />contractor-operated facilities, federally-funded research and<br />development centers, or Government prime contractors that pursue<br />R/R&amp;D or production developed under the SBIR Program, give<br />preference, including sole source awards, to the awardee that developed<br />the technology. In fact, the Act requires reporting to SBA of all instances<br />in which an agency pursues research, development, or production of a<br />technology developed by an SBIR awardee, with a concern other than the<br />one that developed the SBIR technology. (See Section 4(c) (7)<br />immediately below for agency notification to SBA prior to award of such a<br />funding agreement and Section 9(a) (12) regarding agency reporting of<br />the issuance of such award.) SBA will report such instances, including<br />those discovered independently by SBA, to Congress.</p>
<p>(8) For Phase III, agencies, their Government-owned, contractor-operated<br />facilities, or federally-funded research and development centers, that<br />intend to pursue R/R&amp;D, production, services, or any combination thereof<br />of a technology developed by an SBIR awardee of that agency, with an<br />entity other than that SBIR awardee, must notify SBA in writing prior to<br />such an award. This notice requirement also applies to technologies of<br />SBIR awardees with SBIR funding from two or more agencies where one<br />of the agencies determines to pursue the technology with an entity other<br />than that awardee. This notification must include, at a minimum: (a) the<br />reasons why the follow-on funding agreement with the SBIR awardee is<br />not practicable; (b) the identity of the entity with which the agency intends<br />to make an award to perform research, development, or production; and<br />(c) a description of the type of funding award under which the research,<br />development, or production will be obtained. SBA may appeal the<br />decision to the head of the contracting activity. If SBA decides to appeal<br />the decision, it must file a notice of intent to appeal with the contracting<br />officer no later than 5 business days after receiving the agency's notice of<br />intent to make award. Upon receipt of SBA's notice of intent to appeal,<br />the contracting officer must suspend further action on the acquisition until<br />the head of the contracting activity issues a written decision on the appeal.<br />The contracting officer may proceed with award if he or she determines in<br />writing that the award must be made to protect the public interest. The<br />contracting officer must include a statement of the facts justifying that<br />determination and provide a copy of its determination to SBA. Within 30<br />days of receiving SBA's appeal, the head of the contracting activity must<br />render a written decision setting forth the basis of his or her determination.<br /><br />DeLima Associates is the only known source that is capable of providing a fully-functional health effects database of over 11,000 household products designed to be fully compatible with NLM-TEHIP's suite of chemical exposure databases. The database is unique in that, it compiles in one place, brand names of household products, and identifies, for each brand name, its chemical ingredients by chemical name and the chemical's universal identifier, the CAS Registry Number. This linking of brand names to individual chemical ingredients is a valuable component in integrating this information with the existing TEHIP databases that currently contain a wealth of health data on exposure to individual chemicals. In addition, for each brand, the CPID provides: acute and chronic health effects information, carcinogenicity and first aid information. The quality and accuracy of this database on NLM's Household Products Database web site is reflected in its high usage of over 35,000 page views per day. <br /><br />The CPID developed by DeLima Associates is the only commercially available household products health effects database approved by National Center for Environmental Health of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />Although other contractors may be capable of developing and populating a new database, funds are not being provided to develop or to populate the Household Products Database, instead, funds are only being provided to purchase a non-exclusive license to use an existing commercial database owned by DeLima Associates to continue to be hosted on the Household Products Database site of NLM. Since NLM does not own the existing product database it cannot transfer the licensed data contained in the Household Products Database to any other prospective bidder. A new awardee would be required to build a database from scratch at no cost to the government.&nbsp;<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541511 and the business size standard is $25M. This is a 100% small business set-aside. NLM anticipates that award will be made on or about December 22, 2011.<br /><br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months from date of award with two (4) one year options.<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br />The primary mission of TEHIP is to provide core information resources and services, facilitate access to national and international information resources, and strengthen the infrastructure for toxicology and environmental health information. In support of this mission, the Program makes available on the web a suite of databases containing both factual and bibliographic information on environmental and health effects of chemicals.<br /><br />The advent of the web technology made it possible for TEHIP to extend the reach of its existing databases by hyperlinking to other information resources in and outside of the government. Moreover, the web technology helped to make its information resources easily available not only to its traditional users such as toxicologists, industrial hygienists, healthcare providers, and regulatory specialists, but also to the public at large seeking information about the effects of exposures to chemical substances.<br /><br />CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS<br />DeLima Associates will provide data and updates for:<br />12,000 products under License Renewal CPID12000, <br />13,000 products under License Renewal CPID13000 and <br />14,000 products under License Renewal CPID14000.</p>
<p>1. Database Tables to be Licensed<br />DeLima Associates will provide the following database tables under the terms and conditions of the non-exclusive license:<br />&bull; Brands: Brand name and product specific fields<br />&bull; CAS No Brands Connect: Brand names connected to its ingredient CAS numbers<br />&bull; Chemicals: Identify chemicals with CAS numbers or IDs<br />&bull; Handling and Disposal: Instructions for handling, storage and disposal of products<br />&bull; Health Effects: Label Warnings, First Aid, Acute and Chronic Health Effects, Carcinogenicity and Health Ratings<br />&bull; Manufacturers: Contact information for manufacturers<br />&bull; Synonyms: Synonyms for Chemicals in database<br />&bull; Brand and Purpose: Identification of purpose and use for each product<br /><br />2. Material Safety Data Sheets<br />DeLima Associates will provide the full text of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all products added with each license renewal (when available from product manufacturers.)<br /><br />3. Updating of Content<br />DeLima Associates will update content such as the glossary and F.A.Qs and introduce new product categories as needed.<br /><br />This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is a RFQ available. However, if any interested party believes it has the capability to fulfill the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above. <br /><br />Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 12:00 P.M. Local Prevailing&nbsp;Time on Thursday November 17, 2011. Faxed capability statements are NOT authorized. Capability statements and questions must be submitted in writing to Kimberly Pringle at pringlek@mail.nih.gov.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA).</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Allentown, Inc., 165 Route 526, PO Box 698, Allentown, NJ 08501, for animal containment caging system required for housing ferrets infected with human influenza clinical isolates to prevent cross-contamination/infection of animals and prevent environmental release of virus. Individually HEPA-filtered caging is required for collecting contamination-free biological materials and generation of ferret immune reagents following infection with different influenza isolates. Cage system can be used with minimum modification and are large enough for ferrets. Specifications: All stainless steel 20-cage P/NC IVC rack; 20 Polysulfone Micro-Barrier systems including high-temperature Polysulfone ferret cage, high-temperature external bottle well micro-barrier top with stainless steel cover plate to replace pre-filter, replaceable silicone gasket, locks, two spring-loaded stainless steel exhaust ports, hanging feeder that extends towards the top of the Micro-Barrier top (feeder also has an internal baffle that prevents animal from escaping), and high-temperature clear Polysulfone cardholder; opposite side but rear-mounted vertical plenums; Smart-Pak HEPA-filtered supply blower; Exhaust Pak HEPA-filtered exhaust blower; stainless steel split platforms; Edstrom Easy Lock latching mechanism; Edstrom Industries automatic watering with quick disconnect drinking valves; 8.00&rdquo; diameter stainless steel casters; row and column identification tags; overall nominal system dimensions (without removable air handler units): 77.250&rdquo; wide x 34.500&rdquo; deep x 79.937&rdquo; high. System holds twenty (20) cages and each cage is individually HEPA-filtered so that cross-contamination to ferrets housed in adjacent cages does not take place. Cage space is 2000 cm(2) and the height is 27cm. Cage configuration is specific to meet current animal space, but maximizes space use in order to generate sufficient reagent numbers and volumes. Only modification necessary is removal of the wire bar lid and replacement with stainless steel access plate in cage lid to allow easy access for refill of food. Each cage has HEPA-filtered-in inlet/exhaust ports which further reduces risk of cross-contamination. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued.

<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-88 GUARANTEES (APR 2010) <br /><br />(a) In the event any work performed or materials furnished by the contractor under this contract prove defective or deficient within 90 days from the date of redelivery of the vessel, the contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at its own expense, shall correct and repair the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.<br />(b) The Government shall be entitled to rely upon any guarantee secured by the contractor or any sub-contractor covering work done or materials furnished which exceeds the 90-day period until its expiration. <br />(c) With respect to any individual work item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of such item. <br />(d) If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs.<br />(1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is impracticable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel to the contractor, or the contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the contractor's expense.<br />(2) Where corrections and repairs are to be made by other than the contractor due to nonreturn of the vessel to the contractor, the contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable deduction in the price of the contract.<br />(e) The contractor's liability shall only extend for an additional 90-day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies which it corrected. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract. If a defect or deficiency that exists at the time of redelivery of the vessel was not discovered by a reasonable inspection and is discovered after the expiration of the time frame stated in this clause, it is not subject to the time limitations stated in this clause.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-90 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (APR 2010)<br /><br />(a) The contractor shall procure and thereafter maintain the following insurance:<br />(1) Ship contractor's legal liability insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (b) of clause 1352.271-79. This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00.<br />(2) Comprehensive general liability insurance and automobile insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (c) of clause 1352.271-79.

The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies.<br />(3) Full coverage in accordance with the State Worker's Compensation law; and <br />(4) Full coverage in accordance with the United States Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act.<br />(b) As evidence that it has obtained the insurance specified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with a certificate or certificates executed by an agent of the insurer authorized to execute such certificates. Such certificates shall be furnished prior to commencement of the work. Each certificate shall state that (To be competed at time of award) has insured (To be competed at time of award) awarded contract number (To be competed at time of award) for repair/alteration of NOAA Ship HENRY BIGELOW in accordance with the Liability and Insurance clause and the Insurance Requirements clause contained herein. Each certificate shall set forth that each policy of insurance represented thereby will expire on (To be competed at time of award) and that each such policy contains the following clause: "It is agreed that in the event of cancellation or any material change in the policy adversely affecting the interest of the Government in this insurance, 30 days prior written notice will be given to the Contracting Officer."<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

52.222-52 -Exemption From Application Of The Service Contract Act To Contracts For Certain Services--Certification (Nov 2007)

(a) The offeror shall check the following certification:
CERTIFICATION
The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that
(1) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;
(2) The contract services are furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices. An established catalog price is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the offeror, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public. An established market price is a current price, established in the usual course of ordinary and usual trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, which can be substantiated from sources independent of the manufacturer or offeror;
(3) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
(4) The offeror uses the same compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract as the offeror uses for these employees and for equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
(b) Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services. If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(d)(3) that the Service Contract Act
(1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Act of 1965 clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or
(2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at FAR 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services--Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offer, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis.
(c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision
(1) The clause of this solicitation at 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services--Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; and
(2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation.
(d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.
(End of provision)
52.222-53 - Exemption From Application Of The Service Contract Act To Contracts For Certain Services--Requirements (Feb 2009)
(a) The services under this contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the Contractor to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations.
(b) The contract services are furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices. An established catalog price is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the Contractor, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public. An established market price is a current price, established in the usual course of ordinary and usual trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, which can be substantiated from sources independent of the manufacturer or Contractor.
(c) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract.
(d) The Contractor uses the same compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract as the Contractor uses for these employees and for equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
(e)
(1) Except for services identified in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1)(iv), the subcontractor for exempt services shall be selected for award based on other factors in addition to price or cost with the combination of other factors at least as important as price or cost; or
(2) A subcontract for exempt services shall be awarded on a sole-source basis.
(f) The Contractor is responsible for compliance with all the conditions of this exemption by its subcontractors. The Contractor shall determine in advance, based on the nature of the subcontract requirements and knowledge of the practices of likely subcontractors, that all or nearly all likely subcontractors will meet the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this clause. If the services are currently being performed under a subcontract, the Contractor shall consider the practices of the existing subcontractor in making a determination regarding the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this clause. If the Contractor has reason to doubt the validity of the certification, the requirements of the Service Contract Act shall be included in the subcontract.
(g) If the Department of Labor determines that any conditions for exemption at paragraphs (a) through (e) of this clause have not been met, the exemption shall be deemed inapplicable, and the contract shall become subject to the Service Contract Act. In such case, the procedures in at 29 CFR 4.123(e)(2)(iii) and 29 CFR 4.5(c) will be followed.
(h) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (h), in subcontracts for exempt services under this contract.

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/.<BR><BR>Question: Shouldn't there be a line item for both versions of Z87 for both full assessment and for high velocity. Because the samples are reduced in 2010 for high velocity so too will the price for the test and a full assessment?There is no reference to what version of ANSI Z87.1. There is also no indication as to how many samples are to be assessed foreach of the tests defined.
Answer: The statement of work attached to the solicitation defines alltesting required. Paragraph titled "Compliance with ANSI Z87.1" states that aminimum of three samples shall be tested for each test if less than threesamples are specified. It also states that the contractor shall be ableto perform the testing as defined in ANSI Z87.1-2003 and ANSI Z87.1-2010.
    It will be specified in the sample submission form which ANSI methodwe would like to follow for the testing. If there is a price differencefrom the -2003 method to the -2010 method then the contractor shall quote aprice for both. If there is no price difference then the contractor shallquote only one price and state that the price is the same for both ANSIZ87.1-2003 and ANSI Z87.1-2010.
    In addition when determining pricing the section titled "ANSI Z87.1High Velocity" attached to the solicitation defines how the high velocitytesting shall be performed and the contractor should quote a price to reflectthe work and materials required to perform the test in accordance with theSOW.
QUESTION: The SOW states that the all headforms shall have a hardness of 60 +/-5 ShoreA.  The following is extracted directly from the SOW:This specification is likely acceptable for a true "Alderson Headform" fromthe OEM (First Technologies).  However copies of  Alderson  headform fromother suppliers, of which we have two in house are between 40 and 50 Shore A.
The EN headforms are explicitly defined in EN168 specification to be  50 +/-5IHRD.The location this hardness specification applies to should also be defined.Hardness of the headforms seem varies approximately 5 units from location tolocation on the headform.  This is a function of the thickness of the rubbercoating and the geometry of the surface being measure.   Hardness is typicallyis measured on flat surfaces and when measuring curved surfaces there arecorrections factors for the radius of the surface.If possible this item needs to be clarified.ANSWER: The SOW should state 50 +/- 5 shore A or 50 +/- 5 IHRD. Location tested shallbe on the flattest portion of the head form on the top of the head.<BR><BR>

However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs. Solicitation Number 6FEC-E6-060173-B is a standing solicitation with no closing date. Resultant contracts awarded under this solicitation will be Multiple Award Schedule IDIQ contracts with a base 5-year period, and the potential for three additional 5-year options.

<DESC><p>Pursuant to FAR 15.206(e), this RFP is cancelled as of October 15, 2011. The scope of the AMDEP no longer represents the Agency's current, actual needs. Changes in the US Government's strategic priorities in Afghanistan, including changes necessitated by 2014 transition planning, media sector developments in Afghanistan since AMDEP was designed in 2009, changes in the operating environment in Afghanistan and declining U.S. foreign assistance to Afghanistan, specifically in the democracy and governance sector, necessitate significant changes to AMDEP scope. Once a review of the AMDEP is complete, a new solicitation may be issued with a changed scope and at a greatly reduced funding level.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to: (1) Incorporate additional information for the following focus area for FY12: 3.1: Understanding the Operational Environment (Nation-state); (2) Changing the FY12 recommended dates for white papers for this topic area only (3.1.2 - Evolutionary Operational Environment Algorithms).<br /><br />(1) Insert the following topic area under I. Funding Opportunity Description, Section 3.1 Understanding the Operational Environment (Nation-state):<br /><br />3.1.2 Evolutionary Operational Environment Algorithms <br /><br />The objective of this effort is to research and develop an N-party (e.g. coalition, multi-party negotiation, etc.) gaming capability that will be layered on top of the other NOEM modules. The NOEM, or National Operational Environment Model, is a Strategic Analysis/Assessment tool that provides insight into the complex state space of a nation state's operational environment as well as an understanding of socio-cultural / behavior aspects of individuals, groups and organizations that interact with each other and within the environment.<br /><br />This new effort must support one or more interest groups and play out both their interactions/strategies between each other (whom should they team and not team with) and the populace (via the populace module). The idea is that each group has a set of strategic goals and will take action based on available resources as well as the perceived cost/benefit (utility) of their actions. These groups may cooperate and maintain relationships with other groups in a NOEM model, as well as interact with the operational environment. This capability will allow users to investigate the evolving strategies of each group based on the dynamic conditions in the environment simulated by the NOEM. Examples of various interest groups include political entities, coalition forces, indigenous forces, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and insurgent forces. Potential scenarios (e.g., insurgency, protests, military coups, etc.) must be developed to explore possible actions and test its robustness. The developer must work closely with the intended user community to ensure the proposed scenarios are realistic and operationally relevant.<br /><br />Key Words: game theory, war gaming, evolutionary model, behavioral modeling<br /><br />(2) FY12 Recommended dates for white papers:<br /><br />The recommended date for submittal of FY12 white papers for the topic area above is until 21 November 2011.<br /><br />All other information remains the same.

Pursuant to FAA Market Survey posting of March 25, 2011, and responses received thereto, the FAA has determined competition to be adequate for Requesting Offers and making a subsequent award for the Terminal Automation Systems Independent Data Analysis and Solution Development (IDA & SD) effort. This acquisition has been Set Aside for Small Business. Only small businesses, qualifying under NAICS Code 541512 "Computer Systems Design Services" (gross receipts averaging not more than $25 million annually for the past three years) will be eligible for award
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for Independent Data Analysis & Solution Development (IDA & SD) for the FAA Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) and the Common Automated Radar Tracking System (CARTS). These systems collect information from radar and other surveillance sources (including multilateration and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Services (ADS-B)), weather sensors, and flight plan information for each aircraft.  Each system integrates the collected data into graphical and textual presentations used by air traffic controllers to safely and efficiently direct aircraft in Terminal Service Areas. These systems are currently operational nationwide at Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities and Air Traffic Control Towers.  The systems undergo evolutionary and complex software development, often including new and improved functionalities including those for alerts and safety.  The FAA has a continuing need for IDA & SD to ensure that system software evolution continues to allow Air Traffic Controllers to decrease possible accident risks, reduce the number of safety-related incidents, and reduce traffic delays while allowing for inclusion of future software enhancements that meet the challenges of growth and change.

<DESC>STATE HEALTH POLICY DATA BASE (SHPD) <br /><br />The purpose of this&nbsp;amendment #02 to the small business sources sought notice is to correct the size standard for NAICS code 541720 (under Capability Statement/Information Sought, below), and to extend the due date for capability statements.&nbsp; <br /><br />The correct size standard for NAICS code 541720 is $7M&nbsp;average annual receipts (the 500 employees size standard&nbsp;stated in the original notice is INCORRECT).&nbsp; <br /><br />This amendment 02 hereby EXTENDS the due date for capability statements&nbsp;for 2 additional calender weeks until&nbsp;NOVEMBER 24, 2011.<br /><br />The purpose of&nbsp;amendment #01&nbsp;to the original small business sources sought notice posted on 10/25/11&nbsp;was to provide minor&nbsp;clarification&nbsp;to the Project Requiremnents, Item&nbsp;2.a., below.&nbsp; Revised verbiage is included in the updated Notice below.&nbsp; The due date for capability statements&nbsp;was not changed by&nbsp;amendment 01. (it remained 11/10/2011).<br /><br /><br />The following is an updated currrent version of the Small Business Sources Sought Notice,&nbsp;repeated in its entirety,&nbsp;to include&nbsp;amendments 01 and 02:<br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: <br />(1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) the classification/ type of small business (e.g., whether they are small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, HubZone small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small business, economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) or women-owned small business (WOSB)) and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. Teaming and partnering arrangements among small businesses is encouraged.
<p>Background. <br />The NIH Common Fund was enacted into law by Congress through the 2006 NIH Reform Act to support cross-cutting, trans-NIH programs that require participation by NIH Institutes/Centers or would otherwise benefit from strategic planning and coordination. In October 2010 the NIH Common Fund launched Health Economics Initiative to address the evolving needs of the health care sector for economic research.</p>
<p>One of the goals of the Program is to foster the collection/compilation of data that will be most useful for policy relevant empirical scientific research (www.commonfund.nih.gov/healtheconomics). The implementation of health care reform poses numerous challenges and will need to examine the innovation in State health policy statutes concerning health insurance market regulations, the organization of health care services and approaches of controlling costs. One of the major challenges in health policy relevant economics research is to interpret the economic and clinical incentives structure inherent in State statutes which can be converted into statistically analyzable variables of raw data files. The NIH now intends to develop a State Health Policy Database (SHPD) to address this challenge. Further information about the purpose of the project can be obtained from the NIH Common Fund Health Economics Initiative Request for Information to Solicit Input on the Feasibility, Scope and Design of a State Health Policy Database which was issued on June 29, 2011 (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-RM-11-019.html)</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives.<br />NIMH is seeking information on all small businesses capable of providing potential contract services for a project entitled: "Development of State Health Policy Database (SHPD) to Advance Health Economics Research on Health Care Reform". <br />The purpose of this initiative is to develop a research tool that will document state-level policies in a manner that facilitates valid comparisons across states and over time. Insurance regulation, Medicaid policy, financing public health services, and, many reproductive health policies are all under state jurisdiction. Health care reform will add two major activities for states: 1) the establishment of state health insurance exchanges and 2) the Medicaid extension - both of them are aimed at reducing the number of uninsured.<br />Currently no State Health Policy Database (SHPD) exists which can be easily used by academic researchers to assess the comparative differences in States' policies over time and the potential impact of health care reform. Different public and private organizations have state policy level information from their specific perspectives, but there is no one integrated database for health policy research.</p>
<p>Project Requirements.<br />The SHPD is envisioned as a core, multivariate, raw data set with carefully selected numerical or nominal variables on prioritized health policy domains which can be used for statistical/econometric analysis by computer software.</p>
<p>Interested small businesses must demonstrate they currently have the necessary expertise, equipment and capacity in place to develop and manage a State Health Policy Database (SHPD) for research purposes, over a 5-year period (including potential updates).</p>
<p>The SHPD will be populated with CY 2010 data and available for release as a public use data set on or about September 2014. Potential updates of the datasets are scheduled for CY12, 14, and 16, depending upon the exercise of contract options. Sources will be required to develop a website to access the SHPD. Data sets on State tobacco control policies developed and sponsored by various organizations can serve as potential examples (e.g., NCI/NIH tobacco control website and/or the American Lung Association's website).</p>
<p>Interested small businesses must also demonstrate they have the capability and a reasonable plan to provide for updates of the SHPD beyond the base year CY2010 data (i.e., updates for CY12, 14, and 16).</p>
<p>Development of the SHPD with CY2010 data requires the following skills, capabilities and capacities of any small business organizations:</p>
<p>1. Knowledge, experience and advanced training in health policy relevant research, specifically:<br />a. Knowledge and expertise in economic empirical research and econometric analysis<br />b. Legal knowledge of state health policy statutes relevant to current health care reform initiatives and ability to analyze the incentive structure of these statues<br />c. Knowledge and expertise to identify and prioritize the key policy and research questions in this area; sources will be required to convene and manage a one-day expert Scientific Panel meeting and to summarize its recommendations in this regard</p>
<p>2. Knowledge of and ability to access existing publicly available data sets and select most relevant variables for compiling the SHPD data set<br /><br />a. Knowledge of and ability to access publically available information from existing CY2010 multistate health policy databases (e.g. Kaiser Family Foundation database, Urban Institute Database, <br />COMPARE microsimulation model developed by RAND, federally collected and maintained databases by CDC and NLM and other organizations, like National Academy of State Health Policy, etc.)<br />b. Ability to abstract needed data from above data bases and include them in the SHPD<br />c. Ability to prioritize what variables will be included in the SHPD and what other variables will be linkable only to the SHPD</p>
<p>3. Advanced information technology expertise<br />a. IT expertise including research database design and documentation<br />b. User friendly simple website design that will be incorporated into the National Library of Medicine health services research database<br />c. Basic knowledge of computer software for statistical/econometric analysis</p>
<p>4. Data management capabilities<br />5. Project management<br />6. Ability to test the data set by health economists researchers, present the characteristics of <br />the data set in person and via webinar to potential researcher users</p>
<p>Other Important Considerations.<br />No IT equipment will be provided by the Government.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance. <br />July 2012 - July 2014 (with options to extend performance through July 2017)</p>
<p>Capability Statement /Information Sought.<br />Capability statements should clearly state/describe your ability, experience, and resources to design and carry out the services above, including:</p>
<p>1) Staff expertise that would be working on this project, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training<br />2) Prior completed projects of similar nature<br />3) Your business size (number of employees and gross annual revenue), your eligibility under 8(a) or other set-aside programs, as applicable (note: the applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541720,&nbsp;$7M); and<br />4) Your management structure, history of your organization (e.g., number of years in business and DUNS #)</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes.<br />Please note that in order to qualify as an eligible small business for purposes of a small business set-aside, at least 50% of the direct labor cost must be in-house. Specifically, FAR 52.219-14 - Limitations on Subcontracting, states that at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Responses will be held in a confidential manner. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>
<p>If the Government decides to issue a solicitation, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available solely via the FEDBIZOPPS web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. It will be the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FEDBIZOPPS web page for the release of any solicitation and amendments, and to download the RFP and all attachments.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice should be received no later than the posted due date, and can be sent either by mail, fax, or e-mail (banderso@mail.nih.gov) to the point of contact listed. If using the U.S. Postal Service or commercial overnight services, please send an original plus five (5) copies of your response. Note: for commercial overnight services, use the Rockville, MD. 20852 address.</p>
<p>Confidentiality. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>

<DESC>This announcement is being posted to both the Federal BusinessOpportunities (FBO Page located at http:///www.fbo.gov <http://www.fbo.gov>and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) located athttp://www.neco.navy.mil <http://www.neco.navy.mil/> .
 
This is a sources sought announcement in accordance with FAR 15.201 and inanticipation of a potential future procurement program. The Naval SeaSystems Command is conducting market research to determine industrycapability and interest in performing drydocking and non-dry-dockingmaintenance, repair, and alterations of CVN 68 Class Aircraft Carriers homeported and visiting the Puget Sound, Washington area. The Naval Sea SystemsCommand is especially interested in determining small business capabilityand interest in performing non dry-docking maintenance, repair, andalterations of CVN 68 Class Aircraft Carriers home ported and visiting thePuget Sound, Washington area.
 The Government is seeking responses from sources that can performdrydocking and non-drydocking maintenance, repair, and alterations of CVN 68Class Aircraft Carriers home ported and visiting the Puget Sound, Washingtonarea, beginning at contract award (anticipated late Fall 2012) andcontinuing for a period of performance of 5 years. NAVSEA intends to procureexecution planning, ship repair, modernization, and inter-availabilitymaintenance (continuous and emergent maintenance) of CVN 68 Class AircraftCarriers in the homeports of Bremerton and Everett, Washington, utilizingMulti-Ship Multi-Option (MSMO) contracting. Work will be performed atGovernment facilities. MSMO contracts target efficient and effectivemaintenance practices.
 These contracts allow the executing agency the ability to better plan itswork and take advantage of best repair capabilities. MSMO contracts willprovide long-term vendor relationships throughout ships training/deployment/ maintenance/ modernization cycles. In order to reduce coststhrough the benefits of advanced planning, MSMO contracts allow thecontractor to respond to continuous and emergent maintenance requirements onshort notice, and as the contractor is intimately involved with both theplanning and execution, less time is spent evaluating prospective jobs. TheMSMO contractor can also respond on short notice to voyage repairs requiredon deployed ships, giving the Navy the option of using the homeport basedcontractors vice a foreign source, if needed.
 MSMO contracts will be repair and overhaul contracts for an entire shipclass awarded to a prime contractor for a base plus several option years.The MSMO contract provides continuity for planning and maintenance processesfor Navy ships and private sector teams awarded the work. The Government hasprovided the following information as attachments to this sources soughtannouncement:
 
1. The draft solicitation statement of work.
 
2. A typical notional CVN availability work package with standard itemscompleted under past CVN 68 Class Aircraft Carrier availabilities.

On March 2, 1997, the Deputy Secretary of Defense approved the JTAMDO charter that established JTAMDO as a Chairman's Controlled Activity reporting through the Joint Staff Director for Force Structure, Resources and Assessment Directorate (DJ&#8209;8) to be the single organization within the DOD responsible for the planning, coordination, and oversight of joint geographic theater air, cruise missile, and ballistic missile defense operational requirements. On February 17, 2008, the JROC approved a revision to the charter updating roles, responsibilities, and relationships. The focus was expanded beyond theater defense to include integrated air and missile defense (IAMD).<span>&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, JTAMDO was renamed JIAMDO.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Charter amendment states the Director JIAMDO shall report to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff through the Joint Staff J-8, support the Commander, United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) for Air and Missile Defense Integrating Authority activities, and serve as the United States representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Air Defense Committee.<span>&nbsp; </span>Emphasis has been placed on developing and integrating sensors, weapons, command and control, and the concepts to employ them.<span>&nbsp; </span>The JIAMDO Charter, as revised, does not provide for internal personnel to serve in an administrative capacity or to perform the functions considered under this requirement.</span></a></p>

<DESC>The following questions were submitted for the subject white paper request. The responses are provided. The Response Date remains 10 November 2011. The Army Geospatial Center (AGC) POC is Mr. Nishchay Dumera, email is Nishchay.Dumera@usace.army.mil and Contracting Officer is Maria Martinez, email is Maria.L.Martinez@usace.army.mil.   Questions / Responses are also provided as an attachment.<br><br>Questions and Responses<br>W5J9CQ-12-R-0002C<br><br>Question 1: What are the historical cost bench marks? Or Do you have a specific budget for this project?<br><br>Response 1:  I cannot provide information on a specific budget for this project, since the budget should be based on what you fell would be appropriate to complete the objectives of the research. I have calculated the contracting manpower equivalent (CME) for the project to be approximately 1.11. The CME is calculated by dividing the estimated number of labor hours needed to complete the research by 2080. The hours required to complete the research takes into consideration all members of the research team (e.g., senior scientists, entry-level contributors, etc.). If more (or less) time is required you are encouraged to provide an explanation to support your proposed effort.<br><br><br><br>Question 2: Should travel costs be included in the cost? If included, can you provide an estimated number of trips and destinations?  <br><br>Response 2: Yes, travel costs should be included in the cost estimate. I would assume at least 2 trips for data collections. The potential destinations again should be specified in the cost proposal (in order to answer the objectives of the research, where would you need to go to collect data?). Also we typically require a kickoff meeting and close out meeting with the contractor which has to be conducted in person at Fort Leavenworth. So that would require 2 more trips <br><br><br>Question 3. Can the contractor substitute online or virtual meeting systems to control costs?<br><br>Response 3:  We would be open to the possibility of virtual meetings or data collections but they need to be appropriate for the type of meeting or data collection being conducted.<br><br><br>Question 4: What are the specific tasks associated with the project?<br>Response 4: The specific tasks should be specified by the offeror and be tailored to the objectives of the research.<br><br><br>Question 5: Are there any specific skills or education requirements for the personnel assigned to the project?<br><br>Response 5: The team should be tailored to the objectives and tasks to be conducted by the offeror. Though in general, we would like there to be a balanced team handling this project; i.e., either a Ph.D. or Master's level psychologist/researcher who can conduct and manage all aspects of a research project (i.e., participant recruitment and human use issues, survey and interview protocol development, data collection,  data management and analysis, report writing), Ph.D. or Master's level psychologist/researcher for developing the assessments, a military subject matter expert, and a person with experience in graphic design for creating the multi-media resource.<br><br><br><br>Question 6. Is there anything we can submit beyond what is noted in the solicitation or beyond the 5 pages?<br><br>Response:  No. <br><br><br>Question 7:  Is corporate experience examples included in the 5-page limit?<br><br>Response: No, corporate experiences are not included in the 5-page limit. <br><br><br>Question 8.  Is there a minimum number of corporate experience examples that must be submitted?<br><br>Response 8:  According to the submission guidelines you can submit up to 3 examples of relevant corporate examples. If you don't have any corporate experiences then you wouldn't include them.<br><br>Question 9. Can the contractor substitute personal experience (along with references) for corporate experience?<br><br>Response 9:  Someone may have subject matter expertise (SME) or experience in the area which would fine to include along with the appropriate references if they do not have corporate experiences.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories (CART-CL) Services
VA118-12-R-0037

1.	Who is the incumbent for this contract?  
Answer: I-Com International Inc, 2718 Linden Drive, Boulder, CO 80340
2.	You mention that we need to maintain the "EXISTING CART-CL CATH/PCI Applications and databases." Who built these existing databases? 
Answer: I-Com International has been building the CART-CL application for 8 years.  The application consists of user interfaces for entering and displaying data in real time (installed at all 76 active of the VA's catheterization labs and operational 24/7) fully integrated with the VA's VistA/CPRS system (relying upon VISTA RPC interfaces and soon to be migrated to the new VA MDWS RPC broker replacement for RPC).  The application also interfaces with the VA DSS workload and costing system. 
3.	Would you consider a solution that "starts fresh" with new technology, if that vendor can fulfill of the requirements and import all previous data into the system? 
Answer: Yes, but the solution must meet all requirements of the Performance Work Statement and work must begin January 1, 2011.  CART is fully deployed and operational 24/7 at all active VA cath labs

<AWARDEE>Photo Measurement Solutions, LLC, 9486 Maynard Rd, Algonac, MI 48001-4270 US
<DESC>Contract N00033-12-P-9006 is a fixed-price Contract awarded to Photo Measurement Solutions, LLC on an other than full and open competition basis in accordance with FAR 13.106-1 (b)(1) for the following requirement: <br /><br />Background: The LCC 20 USS MOUNT WHITNEY will be undergoing an electrical upgrade in which two (2) new Ship Service Diesel Generators (SSDGs) will be installed adjacent to the existing one. Major modifications must be done to the existing spaces on-board the vessel where the SSDGs will be located and where the new exhaust trunks will run. To help plan the modifications of these spaces, MSC requires a 3-D AutoCAD model of the spaces as they exist now.
<p>Scope of Work: This task provides for professional photogrammetry services to conduct a digital photographic survey of several internal spaces of the ship, followed by the processing and conversion of those photos to create a 3-D model in AutoCAD format showing the layout of those spaces (to include everything in each space, i.e. pipes, structure, bulkheads, machinery, pumps, tanks, lights, deck, overhead, wiring, HVAC ducting, intake and exhaust piping, etc.). The method the Contractor uses to do this shall not interfere with the operation of the ship, ship's personnel, or running of machinery, as this task will be completed while the ship is undergoing an availability in the shipyard. There will be personnel working in the designated spaces, and they must not be interrupted or interfered with. To ensure this, the Contractor shall use a non-targeted data acquisition process to perform the photogrammetry services; therefore, physical reflective targets used for measurement references (or any other type of physical measurement reference tools) shall not be placed on the objects being measured. Due to the ongoing work being accomplished on-board the ship during the shipyard, there could be high temperatures, excessive vibration variations, or interruption of electrical power that cannot be controlled; therefore, the photogrammetry tools (scanner, digital camera, etc.) used must be able to withstand these environmental factors. Due to the time constraints of the availability of the ship for shipcheck and the need for these 3-D models for modifications to take place on the vessel, the Contractor shall expedite both the data acquisition process while onboard the vessel and the time to deliver the final product to MSC.</p>
<p>Specific Tasks: The Contractor shall perform a Photographic Measurement Survey of six (6) specific spaces on the USS MOUNT WHITNEY. The Contractor shall create a 3-D model of each space in 3-D AutoCAD format that will be provided to MSC.</p>
<p>Deliverables: The Contractor shall provide 3-D models of the six (6) spaces listed in AutoCAD format to the TPOC. The Contractor shall provide a Shipcheck Report consisting of the following: the names of the personnel attending the ship, dates attended, spaces worked in, names of any shipboard personnel contacted for any reason, any problems experienced or areas not able to be accessed, and any assumptions that had to be made during the shipcheck because of a lack of information or access. The format of the Shipcheck report shall be an electronic copy in MS Word and shall be submitted to the TPOC 5 business days after the shipcheck.</p>
The Period of Performance for the Contract is 31 October 2011 through 30 December 2012.

As part of a survey of its T&E infrastructure, the Department of Defense has identified the need to develop an Airborne Telemetry Phased Array (AirPA) capability to support T&E of current and future weapon systems.  The AirPA is two airborne telemetry phased array antennas and a digital beamforming controller that will control both arrays to support the testing of weapons systems using L& S Band in one array and C- Band in a second array.  The existing instrumentation capabilities at the National Ranges are stressed due to modern weapons systems requirements of longer acquisition and track ranges and high bandwidth.  The newer weapon systems are far more complex thereby requiring more data to evaluate system health and performance.  Increased data needs translate into greater bandwidth requirements and greater telemetry antenna performance.  The newer weapon systems require a larger test range area, must be tracked at greater distances, and occupy much more of the existing bandwidth than legacy systems<br>

The effort is to widen the number of suboptimal and robust technologies that are available for use in FEC systems and will improve the system-level interoperability between competing FEC technologies.  Furthermore, the SFEC will determine the root cause of the problems with noncoherent decoders and Low-density Parity-check (LDPC), and will identify options to resolve these problems.  The SFEC is focused on system level enhancements to make FEC more robust for iNET.<br>

<DESC>The government has unsuccessfully attempted to dewater/inspect the Foster Dam Fish Ladder several times, with the most recent attempt only drawing the water down by 4-6 inches.  At that level, there was an apparent flow through the side entrance bulkhead that was allowing water to flow into the ladder as fast as the built-in dewatering pumps could evacuate water.  The government has another opportunity to inspect/dewater the fish ladder in the December 2011 through January 2012 timeframe. In order to be able to award a contract for the construction of the upgraded fish facility, USACE has to be successful in this dewatering attempt. Magnitude is under $150,000.00.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) 6150 Oak Tree Blvd., Suite 300, Independence, OH  44131 and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Vetereans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Informatics and Analytics offers this justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition purchase request # 776-12-1-7201-0015.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This request is for the purchase of booth space rental at the annual Association of Military Surgeons of the United States (AMSUS) Conference.  The OIA Training Strategy Program Office is hosting the VA booth at the AMSUS Conference.   Booth space will be rented in the AMSUS Exhibit Hall.  Contracting will enter into a firm fixed price contract for training using Simplified Acquisition Procedures I/AW FAR 13.106-1(b).

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  Booth space in the AMSUS Conference Exhibit Hall is needed in order for the Training Strategy Program office to host the VA booth.  The VA booth requires one 20' x 20' island space and one 10' x 10' aisle space.  This requirement is funded by 2237 # 776-12-1-7201-0015. Booth space is needed to accommodate the Virtual Hospital Display. The estimated costs for this procurement is $6,500.00.  The AMSUS conference will occur November 6-9, 2011.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  Statutory authorities permitting other than full and open competition are 41 USC 253(g), and Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1(a)(2): When the supplies or services required by the agency are  available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   Only One Responsible Source (FAR 6.302-1).  Senior Leadership has selected the AMSUS Conference to host the VA booth as part of VHA OIA's outreach initiatives.  The AMSUS Exhibit Hall is the only acceptable source for hosting the VA booth to satisfy the agency's requirements.  There are no alternative locations to host the booth during the AMSUS Conference.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  The AMSUS Conference is a unique event.  There are no additional sources to solicit to satisfy the agency requirement of hosting the VA booth at the AMSUS conference.


7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated cost will be fair and reasonable based on the fact that these prices are for a commercial item and in line with open market pricing.  The VA is also being offered a significant discount from the AMSUS Conference.  The regular booth space rental is priced at $2,950.00 per 10' x 10' space.  The fee for the VA will be $1,300.00 per 10' x 10' space, for a total of $6,500.00 for all the necessary space for island display of the 20x20 Virtual Hospital exhibit and one additional 10x10 space for use by attendees.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  No additional market research was conducted.  There are no alternatives to utilizing the AMSUS Exhibit Hall to host the VA booth at the AMSUS Conference.  Additionally, the price for booth space was deemed reasonable due to the fact that it is a discounted rate from the fees for non-government entities.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  N/A

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  There are no other sources that would be able to satisfy agency requirements for this acquisition.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  None at this time because there are no alternative sources to satisfy agency requirements, and the discounted rate for booth space offers best value to the Government.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
