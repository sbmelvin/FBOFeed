<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Minerals Management Service (MMS), U. S. Department of the Interior.  It is the Government's intent, based on the information received as a result of this notice, to make an award as a 100% small business set-aside.   The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential small business sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described below.   All interested parties must be able to qualify under the North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 541990: All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services.  The Small Business Association's size standard for this NAICS Code is the not to exceed amount of $6.5 million in average annual receipts.  MMS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  Based on the review of the responses to the Request for Information, the MMS reserves the right to issue a small business set aside, or full and open, competitive requirement for Capability Statements and subsequently a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with FAR 15.202.  However, please be advised that this announcement may constitute the only notice for this acquisition, based on the review of the responses to the Request for Information.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this RFI.  Pursuant to FAR 52.219-14, at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business concern.  In order to compete under this acquisition, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a Capabilities statement as specified herein.  Furthermore, the Capabilities Statement must certify qualification under the NAICS code specified herein.  Offerors who do not qualify as a small business shall not be considered further and will be rejected.  Further instructions regarding submission of Capabilities Statements are contained herein.  Following a review and evaluation of all Capabilities Statements received from this announcement, a list of those deemed qualified to perform the work and which qualify under the NAICS Code 541990 will be established and will be notified regarding release of information on submission of a proposal.  The Government anticipates a combination firm fixed price order and time and materials contract for this effort.  BACKGROUND  With the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) acquired responsibilities for alternative energy activities on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  In the future, MMS will conduct detailed environmental analyses of projects proposed for development.  The potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts on the human, coastal and marine environments must be evaluated in order for MMS to make environmentally sound decisions about managing alternative energy activities and developing mitigation measures to avoid, minimize, rectify, eliminate or compensate for impacts. A comprehensive synthesis and analysis of information existing worldwide and a summary of that knowledge is a fundamental first step needed to gather existing information to assist in identifying data and knowledge gaps.  The results will provide the foundation for a FY07 workshop attended by experts in the field to identify data gaps, determine future study needs and develop priorities for future environmental studies.  Due to the importance of this review as the foundation for future decisions, the products of this study will be subject to a peer review process. The emphasis of this knowledge synthesis shall be on the potential direct, indirect and cumulative environmental impacts of all types of alternative energy activities likely to occur offshore the United States.  However, the Offeror shall review projects that have taken place or are planned elsewhere in the world, including, but not limited to Europe, South America, Asia, Australia, Africa, and The Mediterranean.  Travel to selected areas may be warranted to collect information or interview personnel.  Topics that shall be covered in the synthesis and analysis of existing information include: current offshore energy technologies and future trends; how public acceptance of existing projects was or was not achieved; potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of offshore energy technologies; potential mitigation measures that will avoid, minimize, rectify, eliminate or compensate for impacts; current models designed to determine impacts; gaps in the available data; and individuals and organizations with potentially valuable or relevant information and stakeholders.  SCOPE OF WORK The purpose of this study is to survey, analyze, and synthesize existing literature regarding the potential environmental impacts of alternative energy (wind, current, wave, solar, etc.) operations and consists of four tasks. (1) The Offeror shall develop a framework for identifying, acquiring and presenting the information that will form the basis for the synthesis report.  (2) The Offeror shall acquire, review, annotate, provide copies of and record in a searchable database the existing literature and information.  (3) The Offeror shall develop a list of potential attendees for a future workshop to refine data gaps, determine future study needs and develop priorities for future environmental studies.  (4) The Offeror shall synthesize the information collected in Task 2 using the framework developed in Task 1. The synthesis shall address environmental impacts, technologies available, development approaches, mitigations, impact models and data gaps.  The period of performance will be a maximum of nine (9) months, with a key deliverable due in December 2006.  This study will be peer reviewed.    SOURCES SOUGHT:  Interested organizations should submit a capability statement of approximately 20 pages that details the small business firm's ability to perform the effort described above.  Emphasis should be placed on the organization's familiarity and understanding of this study, their experience in the type of work proposed, demonstrated ability to do the work, and an understanding of the directed missions of the MMS, as well as the company's prior experience in work of similar scope to this project and complexity and delivery of final products in a short timeframe.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  Capability Statements will be evaluated on the basis of: (1) understanding of effort and objectives; (2) experience and expertise of key technical personnel, (3) degree of comparability of past projects to the current project. References will be checked.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.  RESPONSES ARE DUE no later than 2:00 p.m. E.T. on June 30, 2006.  Please submit four (4) copies of your response to the attention of Sharon Teger, Contract Specialist, Procurement Operations Branch, Minerals Management Service, and if using regular U.S. mail - MS 2101, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA  20170.

Locations must be as convenient to the visiting public as possible.  Primary consideration in selecting boundaries will be accessibility by public and private transportation for the greatest number of people in the service area.

This building requires a 20 foot setback from the face of the building’s exterior to the protected/defended perimeter (i.e., any potential point of explosion).  This would mean the distance from the building to the curb or other boundary protected by bollards, planters, or other street furniture.  Such potential points of explosion may be, but are not limited to, such areas that could be accessible by any motorized vehicle, such as street, alley, sidewalk, driveway, parking lot, etc.

Space must be on the second floor, must be contiguous, and on one level without being split by a public corridor or firewalls. The ratio of width to length shall not exceed 2:3.  Space configuration shall be conducive to an efficient systems furniture layout.  Consideration for an efficient layout will include, but will not be limited to, the following:  size and number of columns, column placement, bay depths, window size and placement, convector size and placement, electrical and telephone accessibility, any angles, curves or offsets that will result in an efficient use of space.  Columns must be at least 28 feet apart (center to center) and 28 feet from any interior wall and be no more than one foot square.

In cities with public transportation, the service must be at regularly scheduled times during the entire workday and within 600 feet (or two blocks, whichever is less) from the building entrance for the commuting needs of the visiting public.  The route from the bus stop to the building entrance shall be accessible for the mobility impaired.

Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building's ownership.  Subleases are not acceptable.  

AUTHORIZED CONTACTS:
In no event shall the offer enter into negotiations or discussions concerning the space to be leased with representatives of any Federal Agency other than the officers and employees of General Services Administration (GSA) or their authorized representative.

<DESC>As part of its biodefense research mission, the Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  announces a program to support a systems biology analysis of innate and/or adaptive immune responses to infection, vaccination, or immunotherapy, with a focus on NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens (listed at http://www2.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm). Immunological research that is not directed specifically at one or more NIAID Category A, B, or C priority pathogen or their products is responsive only if the research: 1) addresses a practical approach to inducing, controlling or improving the effectiveness of innate and/or adaptive immune responses to infection by those pathogens or vaccines or immunotherapies to prevent them; and 2) includes validation studies with at least one NIAID Category A, B or C priority pathogen to confirm the importance of the immunological pathway in protection of the host from, or clearance of that pathogen. 

The goal of this program is to develop a more comprehensive knowledge of innate and adaptive immune responses to bacteria and viruses or host responses to vaccines and immunotherapeutics against these pathogens, using a systems biology approach.  Knowledge gained from these studies will advance our understanding of the delicate balance required to induce protective immunity against infectious agents, in particular NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens, without accompanying immune-mediated damage to the individual.

The systems biology analysis shall be based on high-throughput screens of existing or novel mouse models for identification of key regulatory immune response genes, supported by detailed genomics, proteomics, computational biology, and bioinformatics approaches to determine the gene products’ functions in innate and/or adaptive immunity to infection with, or vaccination or immunotherapy against, NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens. 

The systems biology analysis shall include:

(1) High-throughput screens of mouse models for identification of key regulatory immune response genes. Forward genetic approaches are preferred for the generation of novel mouse models or study of existing models, since genes can be identified in the absence of a detailed knowledge of the genetic regulation of an observed phenotype. Some recommended genetics approaches include random mutagenesis using ethylnitrosourea (ENU), or large-scale analysis of recombinant inbred strains or congenic animals.  More targeted high-throughput methods (e.g., high-throughput generation of targeted Knock-outs, Knock-ins, or deletion mutations) may be utilized with adequate justification of the benefits these approaches bring to large-scale identification of novel immune response genes; and 

(2) Human correlation studies for analysis of a subset of immune regulatory genes, identified in the mouse studies, in human cell or tissue samples. While human cell lines may be used in initial screens, results shall be validated in primary human cell lines or tissues.  The analyses shall be designed to determine whether the immune response genes identified in the mouse function similarly in human immune cells. 

This RFP will be available electronically on/about June 30, 2006, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps and the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.     This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.     No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

<SUBJECT>A -- Navigation and Timekeeping Technology
<SOLNBR>BAA06-0022
<RESPDATE>092506
<ARCHDATE>10102006
<CONTACT>John Kim, Program Officer, Phone (703) 696-4214, Email kimj@onr.navy.mil - Carol Brown, Contract Specialist, Phone (703) 696-0436, Fax (703) 696-0066, Email Carol_Brown@onr.navy.mil
<DESC>In accordance with the guidance promulgated by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (NII), concerning Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR), which deals with the mitigation of denial of Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), this effort is concerned with the first two of the three elements:  Electronic Protection (EP) and Electronic Support (ES).  
  
Precision navigation and timekeeping are essential for many modern naval and maritime systems, and it is essential that navigation and timekeeping services be made available to platforms and weapons at the highest level of accuracy and with the highest possible confidence at reasonable cost.  Lack of precise navigation and timekeeping technologies may jeopardize the success of military operations.  For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) provides highly accurate position/time information at low cost and, due to this, GPS has become the technology of choice for many users.  Unfortunately, the GPS signal is a low-power signal that is susceptible to interference. Therefore there is a need for both (1) affordable approaches to make GPS more reliable/robust, and (2) affordable reliable precision navigation/timing alternatives to GPS.   
  
In the past five years, ONR has been conducting a series of Navigation and Timekeeping Science and Technology Projects in the following three technology areas:  
  
1.	GPS Anti-Jam Technology: These efforts have initially been concerned with GPS antenna systems that are able to be steered electronically so that the antenna preferentially selects the intended satellite source and rejects spatially inhomogeneous noise and jammer sources. This effort is also concerned with the coupling of GPS with inertial systems. This latter association is beneficial because it draws upon the unique performance assets of each. In FY06 effort was concentrated in anti-spoof and other emergent threats. The FY07 focus is in GPS Navigation in stressed environments and concerns the development of low cost navigation systems and enabling components for such systems suited to Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and mobile-ground,  mobile-littorally based, and personnel-carried devices. Operation in urban environments, underground, and in other environments that have signal propagation difficulties/deficiencies.  Additionally, this work involves verification that the concepts developed in supported projects actually perform as intended. Upgraded GPS-system assessment facilities at Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) are presently underway. Approaches to improve performance verification through modeling will also be considered for support under this BAA.  

2.	Precision Time and Time Transfer Technology: The on-going areas of interest in this technology area have been concerned with the development of atomic clocks that possess unique long-term stability and precision. Having a precise clock provides a means to synchronize systems rapidly enabling one to convey information at what would otherwise be prohibiting noise levels.  The second effort has been concerned with the development of the capability of: (a) transferring GPS-derived 1 pps Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) via RF links such as Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS)/Link-16 and (b) maintaining a common reference time by tying together existing time standards distributed in the various systems.  The FY07 focus of this area is: (a) the development of more ruggedized small-size, low cost, low power, atomic clocks of adequate accuracy (Allen Deviation of 10-9 to 10-10 in first 1 second integration) for use in GPS timekeeping back-up, GPS signal re-acquisition, and for incorporation into inertial navigation systems (INSs), and (b) the development of a navigation sensor data (position and time) distribution system, which will correct various time sources on a platform by statistical means and produce a common time reference.

3.	Non-GPS Navigation Technology:  In FY06 effort was focused primarily upon gyroscope development. Other efforts in FY06 in this technology area were concerned with the development of a correlation navigation technique using earth maps of high precision (including bathymetric and magnetometric data) that are now available or that are easily produced as a result of present earth satellite measurement capabilities.  The focus of FY07 efforts in this area is: (a) the development of compact, low-cost, all electro-optical INS, whose performance is rated at better than the existing navigation grade INS, and (b) the development of high resolution Charge Coupled Device (CCD), which is applied to an automated celestial navigation system.  The geo-location precision of this automated celestial navigation system is within 3 meters versus the 30 meters precision typically proposed.   
  
Although the above show specific areas of concentration in this program, the program aggressively seeks new and innovative navigation technologies that will provide more accurate, reliable, maintainable and affordable systems for Naval Air, Surface, Subsurface and Ground Platforms and Forces. The leveraging of industry investments and particularly the technologies developed for civilian systems are desired.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH
for
Development and Delivery of Pavement Technology, and 
Construction and Maintenance Training

The Government is conducting market research to:

·	Determine if responsible, qualified, capable sources exist that are interested in satisfying the Government’s requirements generally described below;
·	Determine the capabilities of potential contractors, including an estimate of prices; 
·	Determine size and status of potential sources; and
·	Determine the nature of competition (i.e., 8(a), small business set-aside or full and open)

The National Highway Institute (NHI), within the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Department of Transportation, plans to award multiple 5-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for the development, revision, and presentation of training courses in the areas of Highway Pavement Technologies, and Highway Construction and Maintenance. The work requires skilled, knowledgeable, experienced subject matter experts and instructional designers working together to develop and update course materials, and instructors who possess adult learning facilitation skills and credible subject matter expertise. 

The NHI is the technical training arm of the FHWA, and as such plays a vital role in the FHWA’s overall effort to provide training in new and evolving highway related technologies.  NHI courses respond to changing workforce development requirements and are a part of the technical professional development of engineers, planners, and others in the surface transportation industry.  The target audience for these courses is very broad, and includes Federal, state and local highway and transportation agencies located within the United States, Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP) Centers, associations, consulting firms, private industry, universities, and other national and international entities engaged in highway work of interest to the United States.

The NHI maintains a training curriculum of approximately 135 courses and presents over 600 training sessions per year to more than 15,000 participants nationwide.  For each session, NHI provides course materials and instructors who are trained in the presentation of learner-centered, active course facilitation and are highly qualified in their technical fields.  NHI Engineering courses are taught by university faculty with advanced degrees, FHWA engineers, ex-FHWA contractor engineers, very experienced professional engineers (PE) or combinations thereof.

NHI courses are varied and support many customer needs.  They are an integral part of development activities for graduate engineers in many states as they learn about transportation engineering and prepare for professional licensure.  Additionally, because NHI emphasizes the implementation of new research, standards, and procedures, many courses are directed toward experienced, practicing engineers.  NHI awards International Association of Continuing Education and Training (IACET) Continuing Education Units (CEUs) to those who must earn professional development hours to maintain their license.  Some NHI courses have prerequisites that are part of state certification curricula.

In order for the NHI to best accomplish its training mission, it is necessary to accurately determine the needs of the target audience, and then develop and deliver a variety of training packages that will most effectively and efficiently present the intended messages. The NHI has been performing this role primarily by delivering traditional, instructor-lead, classroom training on a broad range of topics since Congress established it in 1970. However, the electronic era is rapidly opening new avenues for cost savings, complying with divergent schedules, and training larger audiences in shorter periods of time. 

In addition to instructor-led classroom training, NHI is developing distance-learning courses.  NHI has an active web conferencing system that delivers instructor-led synchronous web conference training directly to participant workstations.  Self-paced web-based training is also offered, as well as a blended approach of all three methodologies.  Considering the complexity of the technical subject matter, NHI believes the flexibility of the blended learning model has great potential for reaching our national audience in the future.  

NHI’s goal is to optimize training for maximum effectiveness, ensuring that the greatest amount of learning takes place within certain defined constraints. Part of this process involves development of material precisely targeted to participant needs and providing clearly articulated Learning Outcomes.  The principles of adult learning and instructional systems design (ISD) must be incorporated into the courses, as well as a learning assessment (i.e. post tests, exercise, skill demonstration, etc) in order to be consistent with IACET requirements.  Training includes a combination of instructional strategies such as lectures, videos, case studies, and group exercises/discussions.  To meet this goal, the contractor will be required to provide a development team consisting of both Instructional Systems Designers and Subject Matter Experts to design and develop the courses. 

The contractor will be required to provide highly qualified, experienced, approved instructors to teach these courses. To be truly effective, instructor led training requires skilled, competent, knowledgeable, credible, instructors with adult education experience. All instructors are required to be NHI certified or achieve instructor certification by an NHI Master Trainer.  Potential instructors with limited or no classroom teaching experience must begin the certification process by attending the NHI Instructor Development Course and completing the Web-based NHI Instructor Development Module for Web Conference Training. The procedure for becoming certified is explained more fully on the NHI Web site, http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/.

From time to time, those awarded an ID/IQ contract will be invited to compete for award of task orders that may also include other functions relating to training development and delivery such as needs assessment, marketing, or electronic formatting for Section 508 compliance.  Limited research necessary for development of technical reference manuals may be included. 

Performance under the Task Orders is subject to the requirements of Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended in 1998. Section 504 deals with accessibility for all participants in training classes. Section 504 specifically addresses classroom settings, course materials and accommodations for special needs. Section 508 addresses accessibility issues relative to electronic media such as web postings, web sites, computer simulations, and videos. 

The NHI follows Section 504/508 Compliance in all of its training development and delivery efforts. The NHI and its contractors must, to the greatest degree possible, meet all accessibility needs of its participants. 

 NHI course offerings currently covered by expiring ID/IQ contracts in the area of Highway Pavement Technology, and Construction and Maintenance, as well as the NHI style guide may be found on the NHI web site at www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov.  Additional related courses or web-based offerings may be added as needs are defined.

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to a!  ssist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!   for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or rev!  ised performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are  summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment!  , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.

In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data. Past performance will be evaluated using the Navy's RED/YELLOW/GREEN program as follows: (A) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System, Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) program. RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for the acquisition of commodities used to build and maintain the Fleet--materials, parts and components of ships, planes and weapons systems. (B) The Government reserves the right to award to the contractor whose offer represents the best overall purchase value to the Government. As such, the basis for contract award will include an evaluation of proposed contractor's quality performance history. The price to be considered in determining the best value will be the evaluated price after Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEA) or related quality assurance actions, as applicable, are applied to the offered price.

ITIONAL EVALUATION FACTORS--CONTRACTOR EVALUATION SYSTEM, RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (MAY 1992)" will be used by the Contracting Officer to assist in determining the best purchase value for the Government - price, past quality performance and other factors considered.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a gas source stable isotope mass spectrometer system for the analysis of extraterrestrial and terrestrial materials at the Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) Directorate at Johnson Space Center (JSC). These analyses will be performed on micro-gram-sized samples that are available from meteorites, Mars analog materials, and future samples returned from asteroids or planets. A gas source stable isotope mass spectrometer with Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen & Sulfur (CNOS) and Deuterium/Hydrogen (D/H) universal collectors, capable of high precision analyses with the ability of operating in both dual-inlet and continuous-flow configurations is required.  The specific requirements for the stable isotope mass spectrometer system are follows: (1) The Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer System: The stable isotope mass spectrometer must deliver high precision measurements for the determination of D/H, 13C/12C, 15N/14N, 18O/16O, 34S/32S (from SF6), 28Si/29Si, as well as Ar, Kr and Xe isotope ratios. Since the ARES-JSC requirements are experimental in nature it is necessary to have a wide mass range resolution, therefore the mass range should span 1-150 Dalton, at 10kV (i.e. high enough to analyze the SF6, at mass 146). Mass resolution for Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen and Sulfur should be 200 m/&#61508;m (at a 10% valley); and for Hydrogen 25m/&#61508;m (at a 10%valley).  Furthermore, since small sample analytical capabilities are an integral part of the scientific research at JSC it is imperative that sensitivity for CO2 (mass 44) should be 600 molecules/ion or better, within the dual inlet configuration, and 900 molecules/ion or better when operated in continuous flow mode.	Also, sample consumption should be 0.031 nmol/s or better in dual inlet. Ion source linearity should be 0.02 %/nA (for mass 44). (2) The ion source: The ion source must operate at an accelerating voltage of 10kV in order to maximize analytical sensitivity.  Additionally, the ion source should be constructed in such a way as to minimize leaks; ideally, eliminating metal welds and having it constructed from a single piece of stainless steel would accomplish this. Change between dual inlet and continuous flow operations should be controlled by a single mouse click that calls up resident application specific software.  The total time elapsed during changeover should be of the order of a minute.  The switchover between inlet systems should be totally automatic, and there should be no requirement for loading of new software. Linearity of the ion source should be &lt;0.02‰ per nano-amp ion current and measurement of this specification must be possible under computer control from computer operating program using the dual inlet system.  The ion Source must be self-aligning, so that it can only be inserted in one way.  Procedure for removal and reinstallation of ion source must be specified in detail. (3) The analyzer:  The analyzer’s geometry should be capable of stigmatic focusing with a large dispersion (at least 460 mm). The magnetic sector field should be generated by a high precision current-regulating electro magnet that will allow for mass scanning via magnetic strength regulation.  (4) The Collectors: The collector system should include the ability to collect the following stable isotopes: carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, silicon, argon, krypton and xenon. Faraday cups should be individually shielded to minimize stray ion interference and should also consist of a secondary electron suppression system.  The collector system should allow for up to eight individual cups to be present and any given time. Amplifiers, both CNOS and D/H, should reside in evacuated housings to minimize the effects of high relative humidity, a problem endemic to the Houston climate. (5) The inlet system: The mass spectrometer should consist of not only a dual inlet system, but must also allow for operation within continuous flow mode. This dual inlet should be designed in such a manner as to allow for minimum dead volume; ideally it should be mounted directly to the ion source housing. Changeover valves as well as nominal inlet valves should be all-metal and employ gold-seated and gold-sealed technology, which also will help to minimize inlet dead volume. (6) Hydrogen Collector. The hydrogen collector should be able to analyze D/H ratios by either dual inlet or continuous flow modes. There should be no measurable He tail on mass 3 at He flow rates into the ion source (after any open split) &gt;0.3 ml/min. corresponding to EA and GC flow conditions, and He/H2 ratios comparable to what would be experienced in capillary GC analysis.  The focusing for the m/z=3 beam must be stigmatic. The mass 2 and mass 3 beams must have identical ion optical conditions in the field free drift region between the magnetic sector and the exit slit.  Collector housing should allow evacuation to reduce background noise (7) Differential pumping: Differential pumping will be necessary as a getter for excess He when the instrument is operated within continuous flow mode and should be incorporated in to the pumping design. (8) Micro-volume capabilities: Micro-volume capabilities should be present and be capable of operation in the dual inlet mode with the ability to connect to a cryogenic dewar that is already in the possession of ARES. Sample size should be less than 3 micro liters for CO2. The dual micro volume inlet shall include two exchangeable cold fingers, one with a volume &lt;225 ul for the measurement of CO2, the other with a larger volume for measurement of N2 or O2 onto silica gel or molecular sieves. (9) Power conditioner: A power conditioner will be necessary to free the supply voltage of spikes. A three phase 50/60 Hz dedicated line (which already exists in the laboratory space dedicated to the new system) will feed the power conditioner, which should supply 230V (-10% + 6%). (10) Computer and Isodat software: DATA SYSTEM for control of mass spectrometer, data acquisition, and data reduction must consist of the following: a.	Software operating system must be Windows 2000 b.	Change between dual inlet and continuous flow operations should be controlled by a single mouse click that calls up resident application specific software.  The total time elapsed during changeover should be of the order of a minute.  The switchover between inlet systems should be totally automatic, and there should be no requirement for loading of new software.  c.	It must be possible to cycle between all separate inlet systems without leaving the software and without crashes or hang-ups. d.	Software must capable of fully automated peak centering in all modes of operation, including all CF modes, and it should not be required to reset tuning tables when switching applications. Software must display both beam voltages and updated delta value of sample in real time.  It must be possible to make decision to quit or continue based on d output on screen e.	Software must contain documented routines for corrections of measured delta values for 17O isotopomers of CO2, CO, N2O, and SO2.  These routines should be assembled into a single module and should be applicable to measurements made on all sample preparation devices and all inlet systems. f.	GC-IRMS software must contain documented routines for automated collecting and correcting time-shifted isotopomer peaks, corresponding to isotopically substituted molecules in the sample.   g.	Software must contain documented routine for automated correction of measured &#61540;D value for contribution of H3+, for dual inlet and all continuous flow applications. h.	Automatic data storage must be possible on any external storage device. i.	Data must be archived in a database, which allows searching of all analyses for e.g., all analyses of a specific reference material, all analyses that are to be billed to a specific account, or all analyses run by a specific operator.  It should be possible to use customizable templates to export of the data files. j.	Users must have full access to data with capability to raw data into Excel spread sheets. k.	Software must provide landscape printouts and data transfer based on the raw data files without any reduction of data sets. l.	The instrument control software must have a library of routines that automate the measurement of the quantities that are measured in the final test of an instrument (including absolute sensitivity, relative sensitivity; linearity, abundance sensitivity, peak top stability (=magnet stability), peak side stability (=high voltage power supply stability), VFC converter stability, bellows compression ratio).  These routines should display and compare the measured value and that value specified by the manufacturer.  Printouts from these routines should be included. (11) Thermostated sample tray: A Thermostated sample tray is necessary for multi sample preparation and analysis. (12) Carbonate option: A carbonate option should be included and will allow for the automated extraction and analysis of micro-gram quantities of carbonate materials in large quantities for maximum sample through-put. It shall be possible to use the same auto-sampler and thermostated constant temperature block for high precision analysis of carbonates rocks and minerals. Phosphorolysis shall be performed in individual vials in a tray contained in a thermostated constant temperature block. Flushing of the reaction vial by He prior to analysis must be done in a fully automated fashion, under computer control, with reduction of background CO2 to negligible levels in &lt;5 minutes.  The computer control shall control cessation of the He flow at the end of flushing, to conserve the He from the external reservoir. If the initial sample is out of range, the software should control initiation of automated He dilution of the signal to bring subsequent peaks from the repetitive loop injection to within range; this dilution must be shown to be non-fractionating. Headspace CO2 shall be flushed with He and sampling done via a loop, this sampling must be done under complete computer control, and it should be possible to make repetitive (N&gt;10) loop injections during the course of a single analysis. The loop shall initiate a GC run which separates the CO2 from other gas species (e.g. H2O, O2, N2, Ar). H2O shall be removed with a non-cryogenic porous Nafion membrane. INSTALLATION SPECIFICATIONS: &lt;0.1‰ for 18O/16O and &lt;0.1‰ for 13C/12C for 100 ug CaCO3. Size range for carbonates should be from 50-1000 ug CaCO3 (13) Gas Bench II:  The gas bench will allow for multi-sample preparation and sample introduction to the mass spectrometer in an automated configuration.  (14) Spare Parts/Consumables:  Spare parts/consumables for the mass spectrometer that have been identified as the most common components that require replacing/renewing are required.  These parts should be purchased at the same time as the main instrument because they will insure part compatibility, result in a significant cost savings compared to purchasing parts on an as-needed basis and minimize instrument downtime.  NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Thermo Electron of North America LLC who manufactures the only known acceptable gas source stable isotope mass spectrometer system which meets several critical NASA requirements; which include, a source at 10,000 Volts (10kV) accelerating potential for all masses from 2-170 amu, a system readily configurable to allow both continuous flow sample inlet systems, and dual inlet systems on same mass spectrometer.  Also key is this system’s ability to analyze the smallest possible samples which are of most interest to ARES personnel.  The new mass spectrometer has been designated to replace an outdated mass spectrometer purchased from Thermo Electron.  As such, it is determined that the footprint that is now occupied by the old instrument will serve as an ideal laboratory setting for the new instrument. This location is already configured with the Thermo Electron’s specified required utilities, including the proper incoming voltage feed, correct compressed air pressure and hoses for pneumatic valve operation, and carrier gas availability.    NASA has amassed a large assortment of spare parts, both mechanical (vacuum pumps, etc.) and electronic, which are directly compatible with the new machine. Additionally, liquid nitrogen dewar in the possession of ARES will interface directly with the micro volume dual inlet cold fingers on the new instrument.  Thermo Electron is the only known US based vendor that can provide the long-term support and training that the government requires.  Thermo Electron has experienced installation and service technical support that are located in the US and can support JSC in a timely manner.  They also keep spare parts stocked in the US, which shall minimize instrument down-time.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 16, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>National Institute of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, with Kemp Biotechnologies, Inc. for antibodies.  This Notice of Intent is being issued under NOI6050.  The statutory authority for this acquisition is FAR 13.501 and award is anticipated to be made under a Firm Fix Price Order.  The acquisition documents and incorporated provisions and classes are those in Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-03.  This acquisition will be processed under the North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) 325414 code for this acquisition is and the Business Size standard is 500.  The period of performance will start day of award thru June 2007 with (2) option years.  (NIAID) is soliciting quotations from offerors to acquire a large scale production and purification of several selected humanized IgG antibodies against dengue and other flaviviruses, including West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus.  The objective is to use the purified IgG antibodies for analysis of antibody-dependent enhancement in vitro and in vivo and to validate our on-going mouse and monkey protection studies.  The Contractor will perform the following to produce and purify several selected humanized IgG antibodies, using our own one-plasmid system for transient transfection of mammalian T293 cells.  A total of four IgG antibodies will be produced from their respective plasmid.  We expected to obtain 10-25mg of highly purified IgG antibody, each.  Four plasmid constructs are designated as follow pIgG 1A5 d1; pIgG 5H2 wt; pIgG 3E4 wt; pIgG 1A10 wt.  The Contractor will use a 5-L culture of T293 cells for production and purification of each monoclonal antibody.  The yield is expected to be in the range of 10-25mg of IgG antibody each.  The Contractor will provide a written report of the data analysis also is required to keep all data confidential and to provide written reports and/or recommendations at the request of NIAID.  The Laboratory of Infectious Diseases (LID), with its extensive work in the area of vaccine development including preclinical and clinical trails, has need for large scale production of purified IgG antibodies for functional characterization and analysis of protection against virus challenge in animals.  Highly potent antibodies against provide an alternative for protection against infection.  The LID is currently involved in the design and implementation of a number of trials of candidate vaccines against respiratory, gastroenteric, hepatitis and arthropod-borne viruses.  In the absence of skilled statistical advice inappropriate trial design or analysis could result in the emergence of incomplete data or of misleading conclusions.  For example the sample size could be too small to detect differences, or post hoc analysis could result in false conclusions.  The selected Contractor is proposed to provide NIAID with the proper quantities of IgG antibodies to be used in our on-going experiment in vitro functional characterizations and animal protection studies.  Kemp Biotechnologies has been used in the past and has developed a protocol for cultivating suspension cell lines in scalable systems, suitable for this production.  Changing variable at this time would prevent correct interpretation of the experiments in progress (FAR 6.302-1) Project No. AI 000682-15.

<DESC>The work of this project is to abandon the Taylor Canyon Well in Canyonlands National Park.  The Taylor Canyon well is currently seeping water from around the casing, into the side hill next to the well and is to be abandoned by a licensed well driller in the State of Utah, in accordance with Utah Administrative Code R655-4-12 (Abandonment of Wells).  No water right numbers are known for this well.  All work performed must be consistent with Utah State requirements.       Taylor Canyon well is located from Moab take Highway 191 northbound to highway 313.  Travel on 313 until you reach the Mineral Bottom/ Horsethief road.  This intersection is about 23 miles from Moab and takes approximately 30 minutes.  At the intersection, turn right and travel down the Mineral Bottom/Horsethief road which is dirt.  At the bottom of the steep switch backs there is an intersection, bear to the left (south) onto the (4WD) White Rim trail road.  Follow the White Rim road until the intersection of the Taylor Canyon road, which is signed.  Take a left onto the road into Taylor Canyon, and the well head is less than a mile on the right and highly visible.  The dirt section of road is approximately 21 miles and takes about an hour in a pickup truck.  Total travel time, one way from Moab is estimated at 1.5 hours in a pickup.  Road conditions are steep and narrow at times, with some overhanging rock.  All bidders are highly encouraged to visit the site on their own time.  No site tour will be held.   A Request for Quote will be issued the week of June 19, 2006, to include the Scope of Work. The Product Service Code is S114; the North American Industrial Classification System number is 237110.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to provide bids on a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for procurement of High Speed Internet Protocol (IP) Crypto for International Security Assistance Force Full Operational Capability (ISAF FOC).

The current range of multimedia applications either in use or in implementation within the ISAF operational theatre requires the fielded IP Crypto to have the ability to provide a high throughput of small IP packets. The current NATO IP Crypto Equipment (NICE) was not designed for this purpose and has proven inadequate to cope with this requirement. It is therefore considered unsuitable for use in the ISAF environment. The current requirement for the ISAF theatre is therefore for 140 High Speed IP Cryptos with a minimum of a 100Mbps Ethernet interface and 20 Megabits per second throughput Full duplex processing 64 Byte packets.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. The envisaged bidding procedure for this RFQ will be the BOA procedure with the additional opportunity for the US Delegation to NATO to nominate bidders in addition to the companies identified by NC3A as BOA vendors.

The estimated value of this project is 1.4 million Euros ($1.7 million USD). The reference of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) is RFQ-CO-11971-OPL. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same RFQ reference.

OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The IP Crypto must conform to the MCM-064-98, Military Characteristics for NATO Internet Protocol (IP) Based Cryptographic Equipment (NICE), 11 March 1999. In the addition the following shall apply:

The IP crypto shall support the following interfaces:

RED and BLACK communications interfaces and protocols:

-	As a minimum 100 Mbps Ethernet (full duplex) on shielded RJ-45 and/or Multimode fibre connector.

-	Minimum throughput per packet size as defined as follows:

Packet Size: 64 Bytes
Simplex: 25 Megabits per second
Full Duplex: 20 Megabits per second

Packet Size: 1500 Bytes
Simplex: 50 Megabits per second
Full Duplex: 25 Megabits per second

Note: In any case, throughput with mixed packet sizes of 64 bytes or more shall not fall below 25 megabits per second for Simplex or 20 Megabits per second for Full Duplex operation.

-	IP V4 & IP V6 with corresponding ICMP, according to RFC 791 and RFC 2460

-	IP encryption equipment on the RED side will be connected via a router to a LAN or Workstation; on the BLACK side it will be connected to an IP network via a router and/or firewall

-	Support for Multicast and Quality of Service (QoS)

-	Management of the security mechanisms should be possible both locally and from a dedicated management centre. In general, the same management operations should be available both locally and remotely.

Key Distribution and Management Facility 

The High Speed IP Crypto shall come with a key distribution and management functionality. This functionality comprises distribution and loading of keys to the IP cryptos as well as the management of the system operation and status.

System Management Facility

The system shall have a system management capability and the bid shall include two system management systems, one to be located in NITC, Mons, Belgium (primary) and the other in Kabul, Afghanistan (secondary). The management centres must be able to synchronize and update each other to enable one centre to assume the responsibilities of the other if required without interruption of service.

Key Distribution Functionality

The bidder shall implement the key distribution functionality either in a centralized management centre (Alternative A – preferred option) or through a manual process (Alternative B). If no centralized management system is available for provision to NATO, then a manual distribution process (Alternative B) shall be provided. A manual distribution system will entail significant extra effort and costs to NATO for the operation of this manual system. The cost of a manual key distribution process for the ISAF operational scenario, based on actual and estimated costs, has already been calculated by NC3A as discussed below. This total cost for a nominal one year deployment shall be added to a bidder price proposal for any bid that uses a manual key distribution system rather than a centralized key management system. This will allow fair evaluation of the various bids. The bidder must clearly specify in the bid whether the bid is of Alternative A or Alternative B. 

Automatic Key Management: This comprises key generation and distribution/loading of keys to the IP cryptos. Keys may be distributed electronically from an EKMS, or manually into each IP crypto. In automatic mode of operation, keys are normally distributed electronically from a centralized key management system to that of the IP crypto equipment. Manual key distribution is performed by use of fill device and manual load into the IP cryptos.

Manual Key Management:

Daily Subsistence Costs

Afghanistan is a country where life support services like food, lodging, medical support and laundry services are not available to the same extent as in the developed world. NATO sites in the country are distributed over vast distances, unreachable by means of vehicles as the road network, if available, is extremely poor and vehicles are further subject to a high risk of attack by enemy personnel with small arms fire, mortar, and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Support for personnel necessary for the in-theatre manual key process in Afghanistan, particularly over extended periods of time, is dependent on services provided by the coalition forces. For contractor personnel, the services are charged to the company. Food, lodging, medical support and laundry services are provided by NATO and are charged on a monthly basis at approximately 1000 Euro per month. Air- and land-based transport is provided by coalition forces and is normally not billed to the company. However, scheduling of key exchange cycles becomes increasingly difficult due to uncertainty concerning availability of flights in the required time periods.

Transport

The High Speed IP Encryptors will be located at 64 sites in Afghanistan. The actual location of each site is always subject to change and though some of the sites are likely to be located in the near vicinity of other sites, this is never guaranteed and the worst case is therefore that airborne transport would be required for access to each site. Travel to the sites will at times require several days due to flight availability in and out, which impacts the number of sites that can be done per year by one individual.

Key Exchange Cycles

The High Speed IP Encryptor will have loaded its current cryptographic key set and also the next key set to be used. This means that once loaded with cryptographic keys, the equipment may support its operation for a maximum period of 6 to 12 months depending on the approved key validity periods for the particular crypto equipment. It is estimated that two visits per year are therefore required for each crypto. In the case of unforeseen events, extra visits on an ad-hoc basis will be required.

Labor 

Contractors are already operating in Afghanistan in support of NATO and coalition operations. The cost for contractor support in the unstable regions south and east of the country is significantly higher than for the northern and the capital of Kabul, due to the high level of threat in these areas. As the requirement for distributing and loading key material cannot be allowed to conflict with the responsibilities of the local crypto custodian, it is expected that the key distribution and management service be provided by two individuals (2 man rule for couriers of crypto material as per AMSG 293F) based in Kabul for operation in the northern region and two individuals in Kandahar for operation in the southern region for approximately 6 months each per year.

The key distribution service must be available 365 days a year with the two key distribution individuals covering for the other when the other is out of theatre. Based on experience from ongoing operations, the costs attributed to the abovementioned services are known to NC3A as reflected in actual contracted costs for similar contracts on a daily basis. Labor cost was calculated as an average of the cost for 27 lower cost sites in the Northern region and 37 higher cost sites in the Southern region, resulting in a daily rate of 3, 250 Euros per day. Transport is normally not billed to the company. The manual key distribution service for one year is therefore priced according to the following principle:

(4 personnel x (subsistence costs/month x 12 months) + (4 personnel x (daily labor rate x 365 days) / 2 = (4 personnel x (1,000 Euro x 12)  + (4 personnel x (3, 250 Euro x 365 days) / 2 = 48,000 + 2,372,500 = 2, 420,500 Euros per year

This is a conservative estimate of the real costs since it only covers contractor costs for four individuals for six months each and does not cover transport costs or cost of extra key load equipment required to complete the routine. This 2,420,500 Euros will be added to the cost of any bid that uses a manual key distribution system (Alternative B).

Bidding documents are expected to be NATO RESTRICTED. Further performance of the contract will require contractors to have personnel and facility clearances at a level of NATO SECRET.  

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

With the exception of those firms already nominated as identified BOA vendors, additional firms must be introduced by the U.S. Delegation to NATO with the required Declaration of Eligibility (DOE). A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue the required DOE for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Delegation to NATO, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Delegation to NATO nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Request for Quotation (RFQ) has been issued. 
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 19 June 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Request for Quotation (RFQ) to those on the Bidders List: June 2006

3. Anticipated contract award date: August 2006

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541519   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of the Inspector General (OIG) in Washington, DC, intends to award a sole source Purchase Order (PO) to Internet Security Systems, Inc. (ISS) of Atlanta, GA under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The purpose of this PO is to obtain one-year maintenance and support services licenses for the OIG's RealSecure Sensor for Windows 2003, 13 one-year Maintenance and Support Services for OIG's Proventia G2000, Maintenance and Support Service for  OIG's 1 Proventia G2000F for one-year, and Maintenance for OIG's Dual Fiber Bypass Unit for one-year.  The period of performance for the coverage shall be May 30, 2006 until May 29, 2007.  The North American Industry Classification System Code for this requirement is 541519.  NO SOLICITATION OR  REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   The nature of OIG's business processes and the sensitivity of its data require OIG to use secure virtual private network (VPN) architecture.  That Office must have the ability to preemptively protect its information and to avoid violations of the Privacy  Act and virus, worm and data corruption intrusions by sources outside of the EPA backbone into its General Enterprise Resource (TIGER) system.  EPA already owns the RealSecure and Proventia software licenses.  EPA has determined that since ISS is the sole owner of the RealSecure and Proventia  Enterprise Security Platform software licenses, it is the only source for the Agency's requirement for the maintenance and support services.  If any firm believes that it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein, it may submit a capabilities statement, no-later-than 3 p.m. on June  14, 2006, to Carlen Pinskey, Contracting Officer, in writing.  All questions and responses to this posting must be in writing.  The Government's determination not to compete this requirement is within its discretionary authority.  Please direct all questions to pinskey.lin@epa.gov

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   In accordance with FAR  Part 13.106-1(b)(1),  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE BASIS with Vashaw Scientific, Inc (Leica Microsystems) to manufacture an inverted epi-fluorescent microscope with differential interference contrast (DIC) and interference modulation contrast (IMC) images using bright-field objectives. The U.S. EPA ?s office of National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL), Neurotoxicology Division (NTD) microscopy core users group image and analyze both living and fixed cells  and tissue to assess morphological changes induced by exposure to neurotoxicants. This particular requirement is for a LEICA DMI research inverted microscope equipped with DIC, IMC and fluorescence, with high resolution ORCA-AG camera and COMMIX IPA Image Analysis software. Based on the EPA's  knowledge of the inverted epi-fluorescent microscope industry, Leica Microsystems (represented by Vashaw Scientific, Inc) is the only manufacturer which combines the use of bright-field optics for fluorescence, DIC, and IMC with automation required for the multiple user environment in the  NHEERL/NTD microscopy users group. The total microscope/camera/imaging software package provided by Leica and Vashaw Scientific is critical in providing an automated microscope imaging system that will satisfy the low-light quantitative fluorescence requirements for high-resolution images of  sub-cellular structures in the nervous system.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to this  requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact  within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  Interested parties should submit a written request to Yvonne Harris (513) 487-2101 (fax) or e-mail harris.yvonne@epa.gov to receive consideration for this procurement. Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture, and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The technology:  an ultrasonic-based inspection system that measures stress and strain in sections of bent or bulged pipe useful in the determination of safe operating pressure and suitability for continued service.  The non-contact device traverses the pipe internally or externally and can both rapidly detect the damaged region and characterize the degree of deformation by providing a measure of the effective plastic strain.  It provides advantages over dimensional measurement techniques by providing a sophisticated and accurate measurement of acoustic material properties directly related to the mechanical properties of the pipe.  Excellent for comparison of pre- and post-deformation and resulting changes in operating strength.  Suitable for measuring damage from subsidence, earth movement, and wind induced vibration.  The inspection system offers proactive monitoring for incident prevention and can extend the service life of pipelines by avoiding premature repairs or replacement.  Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 45 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Radiation Biology Branch (RBB) plans to enter into a sole source procurement for a Bruker Biospin e-scanR Table Top EPR Analyzer from Bruker Biospin Corporation, 44 Manning Road, Billerica, MA  01821.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items. Bruker is the only source known to the NCI researcher that has a table top EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) scanner that provides features that are required for their research and detailed below in their JOFOC.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform requirement as detailed in the JOFOC they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EDT, on June 19, 2006.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  EPR Table Top Scanner

Purpose/Brief History:

The Radiation Biology Branch conducts studies on cellular and whole animal responses to gamma-irradiation, chemotherapy drugs and radio-protectors and sensitizers.  Nitroxides are a class of compounds known to have radio-protective activity.  Nitroxides can be detected with high sensitivity using EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance).  

The table top EPR scanner will be used to determine nitroxide concentrations for laboratory and
clinical samples.  Bruker is the only company that makes the table top scanners with the required
sensitivity and ease of control.  The scanner will be ideal for our laboratory which has limited
space. 

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

Bruker Biospin Corporation is the only known source that makes a table top EPR scanner with nitroxide detection sensitivity.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>A critical success factor in FRA’s Human Capital Implementation Plan is developing and enhancing managerial/executive leadership skills.  Executive coaching is one tool to enhance a manager’s effectiveness by affecting a shift in the manager’s knowledge and behavior, using a structured process.

FRA has approximately 800 employees spread throughout the United States, of which, 75 are managers and executives.  To better prepare the managers and executives, FRA encourages these managers to pursue coaching.  Managers/executives range from 1st line supervisors over small organizations to executives overseeing large organizations.  However, only new supervisors are required to take coaching within 12 months of assuming a supervisory position.

The number of FRA managers who will be seeking coaches each year may range between 5-15.  FRA anticipates awarding more than one IDIQ contract with no guaranteed minimum.  The period of performance for this requirement is one base year and 4 one-year options.  The solicitation will be issued electronically using FedBizOpps on June 09, 2006.  No written copy will be available.

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, National Forest in Mississippi is seeking survey services for landline maintenance.   Approximately eight hundred miles of land line maintenance work is anticipated in Hurricane Katrina impacted areas of the Desoto National Forest in Mississippi.

Criteria 2:	Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required.		
Criteria 3:	Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time. 
Criteria 4:	Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, compliance with performance schedules. 
Criteria 5:	Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.  

Each proposal must include two plats of survey from previously completed rural boundary surveys, performed under the direction of the licensed land surveyor identified by the submitting firm as the individual who will conduct survey work under an awarded contract.  Each proposal shall also include the firms’ quality control plan and proposed methods and procedures for conducting rural boundary surveys. 


The SF-330, and sample plats of surveys are due by CLOSE OF BUSINESS (4:30 PM CT), June 23, 2006. These should be submitted to Anieta McLendon, USDA Forest Service, R8/R9 Western Operations Center, 100 W. Capitol St., Suite 1141, Jackson, MS 39269.

<DESC>Grazing control of yellow starthistle.  This contract is to provide approximately 1000 head of yearling goats (or older) with herders, guard and herd dogs, to control 800-1000 acres of yellow starthistle in a study area on lower Bentz Ridge, Northeast of White Bird Idaho, on the Nez Perce National Forest.  The project area is an open steep grassland slope bounded on the south by South Fork White Bird Creek and Pinnacle Creek.  The North boundary consists of Bentz Ridge.  The objective is to shrink the target weed population extent and density, and reduce seed production of this Idaho noxious weed by 90% while maintaining desirable vegetation.  Grazing would occur during two prescriptive periods: 30 days during the bolting/early-flower phase of yellowstar (June-July) and an additional 30 days, if necessary, in the fall prior to seed scatter (October).  Camp access and management would require the use of an ATV or Pack animals along Bentz Ridge.  The contractor will need to provide a set of portable watering troughs to draft water from White Bird Creek, and to arrange for pasture or feed outside the prescriptive season and off the National Forest.  The animals brought to the National Forest must have been managed as a herd for at least 6 months prior to turn-on.

Contract completion date is anticipated to be no later than July 2007.

<DESC>Intent to Establish a Qualified Manufacturers List for High Pressure, High Flowrate Flow Measurement Services

The above referenced notice is hereby amended to incorporate technical information, and clarify terms.  

The due date for responses, is hereby extended as follows: 
FROM: November 4, 2005   TO: November 17, 2005.

1.  Paragraph 5 reads:  Such access is required in a timely manner, and will utilize the operating and technical expertise of the supplier’s personnel to safely and effectively operate the facilities for the purpose of establishing flowrate measurement standards and the calibration of flow meters in a range of sizes.   
	The term timely takes two aspects.  The first is reponse to the initial request by NIST for a slot in the supplier’s schedule at the facility.  This timeline should be less than 2 weeks (10 working days) from the time NIST initially places the request.  
	The second is the actual slot in the facility schedule, which could be of two classes, short turnaround time and normal.  
SHORT TURNAROUND TIME:  Mounting of the meter to be tested 
should begin within two weeks or less of the time of the initial official request and testing procedures at the facility should be completed with minimal delay (i.e. a good faith effort by the supplier to complete the testing schedule requested by the customer.  

NORMAL TURNAROUND TIME: The supplier provides scheduling for 
testing time in accordance with with their normal schedule and requires no particular measures to expedite the testing procedures.

2.  Paragraph 8 begins: Measurement uncertainty documentation for the flow measurement standards and facilities – both tiers.  The last sentence is hereby changed to read as follows:
  
  Such requirements are available upon request or may be found at www.cstl.nist.gov/div836 under ‘Measurement Standards and Instrument Calibration Services’.

<SUBJECT>H--National Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) - Modification to Previous Pre-Solicitation Notice
<SOLNBR>W912DY-06-R-0018
<RESPDATE>063006
<ARCHDATE>08292006
<CONTACT>sarah.annerton, 256-895-1167
<DESC>This Pre-solicitation notice is provided in order to synopsize an anticipated Request for Proposal (RFP) for a National Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC).  The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated that Federal agencies reduce energy consumptio n in buildings by 20 percent relative to a 1985 baseline by the year 2000. Executive order 12902 and OPNAV 4100.5D further increased the mandated energy savings to 30% by the year 2005.  ESPC contracts are one method available to the Government to reduce e nergy consumption.  ESPC allows an activity the flexibility of purchasing new energy efficient equipment and systems with no up-front cost. Under ESPC an Energy Service Company (ESCO) provides expertise and private financing for the development and impleme ntation of energy projects. Contracts can be awarded for a period up to 25 years and are financed by the contractor at no capital cost to the government. The cost of the project is repaid over the term of the contract through savings realized from lower ut ility costs. Energy cost savings measures in aggregate must be able to have their costs, including debt service and ESCO fees paid through savings over the ESPC term. Some common products and services provided by an ESCO include: Equipment/system design, E quipment/system installation, Equipment/system testing, Operations, Maintenance and repair, etc.  The Government intends to engage a contractor and/or contractors, hereto referred to as ESCOs, to investigate, develop, and submit to the Government Energy C ost Savings Measures (ECSMs) in the 50 sates, Washington D. C., and all U.S. Territories.   The types of projects awarded under the contract are anticipated to be electrical, mechanical, water/wastewater, and renewable energy type projects.  This anticipa ted contract is intended for use by federal and state Government facilities, and when implemented will provide energy dollar savings to the Government.  State government facilities are included to allow for the development of energy projects in state facil ities that are co-located on federal installations or facilities such as the Army National Guard.  Unless otherwise indicated herein or directly by the contracting officer, the scope of this contract will include any ECSM(s) proposed by the contractor and accepted by the Government and any ECSMs proposed by the Government.  It is however the objective of the Government to first initiate the ECSMs and then request proposals from the contractors in order to enhance full and open competition of the initiated  ECSMs.  It is anticipated that multiple contract awards will be made under this acquisition.  One or more of the awards may be set-aside for small business concerns provided that two (or more) qualified small businesses meet the technical, capacity, cred it, and competency requirements to perform ESPC contracts.  The Government intends to award contracts based upon information contained in the offerors initial proposal (without discussion), circumstances permitting.  Depending on the content and quality o f the offerors proposals, all awards may be made either with or without discussions.  If discussions become necessary, a competitive range shall be established followed by a request for Final Proposal Revisions only to those ESCOs meeting the evaluation criteria.  It is also conceivable that no awards would be possible without discussions.  The resultant contracts awarded from this anticipated solicitation will constitute Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts valued at approximate ly $20 - $500 million each as defined in FAR 16.504.  The method of ordering shall be in the form of the issuance of task orders.  The task orders will be issued bilaterally.  The anticipated solicitation and resultant contract awards are for a 10-year (or dering) period.  The initial ordering period shall be for five years, with two additional ordering periods of three and two years respectively.  Performance of any task orders placed during the ordering period shall not exceed a total of 25-years of the contract term.  The Government is under no obligation to issue any orders against contracts resulting from this anticipated solicitation.  42 USC 8287 provides th at the contractor shall incur the costs of implementation energy savings measures, including at least the costs (if any) incurred in making energy audits, acquiring and installing equipment, and training personnel, in exchange for a share of any energy sa vings directly resulting from implementation of such measures.  The Government is prohibited by law from paying a contractor if energy savings are not generated; therefore, the Government cannot guarantee the contractor a minimum dollar task order.  The G overnment guarantees that the contractor will be given fair opportunity and equal consideration for award of task orders unless the Government determines that the task order meets one of the exceptions to fair opportunity as identified in FAR 16.505.  The Government reserves the right to synopsize and award additional contracts for similar work prior to the contract award or during the performance period of the resulting contracts.  Huntsville Engineering and Support Center is the only authorized ordering o ffice.  Other ordering offices may be added by modification at the discretion of the contracting officer.  This pre-solicitation notice is intended to provide the industry with a synopsis of an anticipated ESPC solicitation to be posted to FedBizOpps in th e future.  No response is required from industry as a result of this synopsis.  Contact Information: If you have any questions or would like to request additional information concerning this anticipated requirement, please contact Ms. Sarah Annerton at (25 6)895-1167, 4820 University Square, Huntsville, AL 35816; email:  Sarah.Annerton@hnd01.usace.army.mil.

Before we can begin the contracting process with your company, I need the following Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) completed-- http://orca.bpn.gov/.  FOR MPIN REGISTRATION: http://www.ccr.gov/mpin.asp.   Use of online representations & certifications application (ORCA) became mandatory 1 January 2005.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes, standardizes, and moves the collection and storing of FAR level representations and certifications online. Representations and certifications are to be completed at least annually by vendors on-line through the ORCA portion of the Business Partner Network (BPN).  Contractors, presently registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), can get a head start by going to www.bpn.gov/orca/ to activate their ORCA profiles.  Initially, ORCA will retain the most significant contractor representations and certifications that would apply to any acquisition in the form of 26 questions.  Solicitation-specific representations and certifications may still be used outside of ORCA.  Further information on this initiative may be obtained from the  ORCA help menu, http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx.  This help menu includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), and the ORCA Handbook.

<DESC>The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) and scheduling an Industry Day to fulfill the requirements set forth below. The Secretary of the Navy was directed by Congress in Reference (a) to provide a report on the analysis of alternative propulsion systems for surface combatants and amphibious warfare ships (alternate propulsion study).  Additionally, the Chief of Naval Operations has directed the Naval Sea Systems Command to evaluate the Navy need for emerging Integrated Power System technologies and to guide the development and transition of technology to the fleet.  Naval Sea Systems Command is the lead activity in gathering and evaluating information regarding current systems and equipment used throughout government and industry, and research and development efforts underway having shipboard propulsion and power implications. Key areas under evaluation are energy storage, energy conversion, power generation, energy distribution and energy transmission. The attached survey requests quantitative data for systems and equipment that will populate a technology readiness versus performance database.  Selected system/equipment technology will be exercised with design tools to determine the impact to total ship capability. The alternate propulsion (AP) study will evaluate current and future technology expected to be available for surface combatants and amphibious warfare ships within the next 10 to 20 years.   The next generation IPS (NGIPS) study will look to evolve current initiatives in integrated power.  For the alternate propulsion study, measures of performance (MOP) will be modeled that are strong effectors of ship mobility, survivability and warfare mission effectiveness.  This AP study postulates a future fleet of surface combatants and amphibious warfare ships in a world environment of rising fuel costs.  For the next generation IPS study, postulated requirements for emerging ship classes, spiral development opportunities for current ship classes, and emerging capabilities of high-power weapons and sensors will form the basis for assessments.  In contrast to the broader technological view of the alternate propulsion study, the next generation IPS study will be limited to integrated p!  ower systems elements including integrated motor/propulsor concepts and support for electric weapons.  The next generation IPS study will include submarines. This effort is supporting the responses to Congress and Chief of Naval Operations that will suggest the focus of future research and development efforts towards technologies that provide the best value to performance.  The studies will also determine technology shortfalls that will focus basic science and research efforts.  This undertaking is expected to serve as the foundation for developing a roadmap for U.S. Navy propulsion and power research and development. We request industry leaders and innovators across the spectrum to provide the survey information for systems/equipment you are operating, manufacturing, or developing which could benefit the U.S. Navy ship propulsion program in the areas above.  As the response to Congress is due in the fall your timely response in providing this survey information by 23 June 2006 is necessary.  We are not soliciting proposals but are conducting a survey of applicable technologies.  All data will be treated as proprietary to preserve the intellectual property rights of survey participants.  In addition to this request for a response to the attached survey, an Industry Day is being planned to allow contractors and university representatives, respond to Navy-led briefings and discussions relating to these AP and NGIPS studies.   The briefings to be presented at this event will be assigned Distribution Statement "D" (Critical Technology) therefore only DoD and DoD contractors are allowed to attend. Any other U.S. requests shall be referred to NAVSEA 05, SEA 05Z or SEA 05D.  This Industry Day is scheduled for 27 June 2006 and will commence at 0800.   The address for this event is:  1201 M Street SE, Suite 400, Conference Room 440, Washington, DC, 20003.  The conference fee will be $25US which will include breakfast, lunch and afternoon snack.  Parking will also be available.          Submittals Please fax your survey responses to the POC noted on the survey form. Information provided in response to this RFI shall be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. For Industry Day attendees, please call POC to RSVP.  Please RSVP no later than 26 June 2006.

The successful contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials, services, equipment and facilities necessary to timely support the requirements of the statement of work, to include, technical support in developing effluent guidelines and industry studies, including the conduct of literature searches and other data collection activities.  The contractor shall be responsible for conducting site visits and sampling of water and wastewater at industrial facilities, developing and administering surveys, analyzing data, preparing industry profiles, evaluating wastewater and pollution control technologies, estimating capital, operation, and maintenance costs of wastewater treatment, best management practices and pollution prevention technologies.  In addition, the contractor shall be responsible for evaluating alternatives to regulations - such as voluntary compliance and pollutant trading. The contractor shall evaluate the fate and transport of pollutants in the environment, manage data through the use of databases, and prepare reports, data summaries and other documentation.  The contractor shall conduct analyses of new industrial wastewater regulations required by Executive Orders and prepare regulatory and administrative documents sufficient to comply with applicable requirements, such as, the Regulatory Flexibility/Small Business Regulatory Enforcement and Fairness Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act, and Environmental Justice.  The contractor shall provide support services to assist USEPA in implementing existing industrial wastewater and NPDES regulations, such as the development of outreach and training materials. Additionally, the contractor shall review reviewing rulemaking records and providing support in the conduct and set-up of conferences and workshops. Any resulting solicitation will include management of multiple, concurrent work assignments which will require long-term as well as quick turn-around responses essential to the statutory responsibilities of the EPA.  Contingent upon responses received, it is contemplated that a level-of-effort cost-plus-fixed-fee solicitation will issue requesting proposals for services consisting of a base period performance of twelve months, followed by four (4) optional performance periods of 12 months each, for a total potential performance period of five (5) years. Each performance period will consist of approximately  25,000 direct labor hours, being, 2,500 base direct labor hours plus 22,500 optional quantity direct labor hours, for a maximum combined total of 125,000 direct labor hours, base and all optional quantities, over the five (5) year life of the contract.  The standard EPAAR solicitation provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72) requiring an offeror to certify that it is unaware of any potential Conflict of Interest or to disclose any potential Conflict of Interest of which it is aware will be a part of the solicitation. The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential Conflict of Interest discovered after contract award will also be a part of the solicitation. Given the nature of the support required, additional conflict of interest requirements relative to regulated industries may be required. These additional conflict of interest requirements are currently being developed and will be provided in the pre-solicitation synopsis. The requirement is intended to be 100% set-aside for small business. The applicable NAICS code is 541620 with a size standard of $6.522 million. ANY INTERESTED FIRM should submit a capability statement which demonstrates the firm?s ability to perform the key requirements described above.

<DESC>In February 2005, the Navy Aerial Target and Decoy Systems Program Office (PMA-208) of the Program Executive Office for Strike Weapons and Unmanned Aviation [PEO (W)], conducted a Request for Information (RFI). The United States Navy has an emergent requirement for a cost-effective aerial target system to simulate a Subsonic Cruise/Supersonic Sprint Sea-Skimming Anti-Ship Cruise Missile Threat. This Target System will be used to support current Fleet training of weapon systems as well as the test and evaluation of ship self-defense systems currently in development. Examples of these programs in development include, but are not limited to, the SM-6, AEGIS, and DD (X) programs. It is anticipated that the target program will enter System Development and Demonstration (SD&D) in early FY-07 timeframe. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is desired in late FY-10. As a result, the program office is considering various acquisition strategies in order to meet the cost, schedule and performance requirements. These strategies may include, but are not limited to: new development; modification of current target or missile systems; and conversion of surplus missiles in US inventory. ///////

Subsequent to the original RFI the program requirements have been refined and the Navy has nearly completed writing the Capabilities Development Document in anticipation of submission for review in March 2006.  Information that may be critical for Industry to refine its concepts for the Threat-D target system has been uploaded to the PMA-208 web site (Titled: Threat-D Industry update.ppt) at http://www.navair.navy.mil/pma208/  Click on “Current Events” and then “Threat-D Targets.”  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES HAVE ALSO BEEN POSTED TO THE ABOVE SITE (TITLED: THREAT-D QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, DATED 2 MAR 2006). ///////

PMA-208 intends to conduct another Industry day in the next few months, and anticipates posting the Industry Day announcement by the end of March 2006 on FEDBIZOPS.  Industry day subjects will include status of the program and anticipated schedule. ///////

All inquiries should be delivered via email to Jennifer Augustine, jennifer.augustine@navy.mil and Joe Valenzuela, joseph.Valenzuela@navy.mil. ///////

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOR WILL THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION SOLICITED OR PROVIDED.  Questions or comments may be addressed to Ms. Jennifer Augustine at (301) 757-5896, email jennifer.augustine@navy.mil or Mr. Joe Valenzuela at (301) 757-6115, joseph.valenzuela@navy.mil email.

<DESC>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small businesses to provide administrative support and services using knowledge of scientific areas equivalent to that needed in the work of an Extramural Program Director, for the Office of Research on Women?s Health (ORWH), National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS).

The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) provides administrative support to the Office of Research on Women?s Health (ORWH) specifically to coordinate the activities of the grant program entitled, ?Specialized Centers of Research on Sex and Gender Factors Affecting Women?s Health?(SCOR).  ORWH works in partnership with the NIH institutes and centers to ensure that women?s health research is part of the scientific framework at NIH and throughout the scientific community. NIAMS is the service center for the administration of this program.

SCOR grants each include from three to four projects as well as an administrative core.  The grants are assigned to Program Directors within institutes that best reflect the scientific theme of the projects.  NIAMS provides the necessary coordination of the Program across Institutes.

The contractor shall provide administrative support and services using knowledge of scientific areas equivalent to that needed in the work of an Extramural Program Director.  The objectives listed below are necessary for the successful oversight and coordination of the trans-NIH ORWH SCOR Program. 

This procurement is intended to provide support for Program coordination for the P50 SCOR grants for the Office of Research on Women?s Health including: 1) Respond to questions by potential grantees regarding the ORWH SCOR RFA; 2) Coordinate the review of the grant applications with the NIAMS review branch, CSR, and the ORWH; 3) Hold monthly meetings with the SCOR Program Directors (6) and prepare monthly meeting materials and meeting summaries; 4) Plan for the annual SCOR Directors? meeting with ORWH administrative staff; logistics contractor and Program Director; 5) Plan the ORWH Research Symposium with ORWH administrative staff; coordinators of other ORWH grant programs, such as the Scholars Program; logistics contractor and Program Directors; 6) Coordinate the collection of meeting materials from SCOR PIs in preparation for the Symposium and the SCOR Directors Meeting; 7) Revise meeting materials for the next years? meetings based on evaluations provided by meeting participants; ORWH administrative staff; the SCOR External Advisory Committee and Program Directors; 8) Monitor and provide updated information to the SCOR Listserv; 9) Facilitate and coordinate activities of SCOR PIs related to articles and other publications emphasizing the SCOR program achievements; 10) Review all SCOR progress reports and supplemental progress reports for adequacy; 11) Coordinate the activities and input from the SCOR External Advisory Committee (EAC) appointed by ORWH; 12) Site visit SCOR program sites as needed; 13) Attend meetings of the internal and external advisory councils to ORWH; and 14) Respond to the ORWH requests for reports throughout the year.

Coordination of the SCORs for the ORWH is important in order to assure that although the grants are distributed across Institutes, the Program Directors continue to be involved and administer the program consistently.  The SCOR coordinator is responsible for reviewing the progress reports as well as preparing the review format for the External Advisory Committee and reviewing the input from this report as well.  Periodic reports (approximately 8 per year) and presentations (approximately 4 per year) are needed for various purposes as is analysis of the information provided by the SCOR Directors, to be provided to ORWH.  Monthly meetings of the Program Directors, organized and conducted by the Coordinator are held in order to share information and plan the symposium and annual meetings.  Additional meetings with the contractor for detailed planning for the annual symposium and Program Director meeting usually held in October or November each year are essential to the success of the SCOR program.  

The Center for Scientific Review (CSR) will be responsible for the review of the applications in response to the 2006 RFA.  The SCOR Coordinator will provide Program support for the review process.

Developing and maintaining methods to encourage networking of SCOR PIs, such as the SCOR PI ListServ, is an important role of the Coordinator. In FY 2006 the Coordinator will be playing a lead role in working with SCOR PIs to publish a journal issue on the SCORs with a projected completion date of December, 2006.  It is anticipated that similar activities will occur each year.

The administrative support provided by the Contractor includes, but is not limited to, working with the logistics contractor on details such as lists of meeting attendees; menu selection; contacting PIs; providing information to the External Advisory Committee members, designing forms and formats, assuring that the contractor is performing as requested, etc.  In addition the role of the coordinator in attending monthly planning meetings and recording significant information is critical to documentation of the decision making process.

The expected outcome is a well coordinated trans-NIH program resulting in appropriate oversight of center grants which administer projects focusing on research on sex and gender factors affecting women?s health and the dissemination of information from these grants.

Required for this contract is knowledge of and skill to apply quantitative and qualitative analysis and evaluation methods and techniques to monitor a trans-NIH Extramural research program.  
Scientific knowledge and oral and written communication skills to interact with NIH Program Directors, ORWH Professional Staff and project investigators.

The acquisition is estimated to take twelve months to complete expending approximately 1,248 direct labor hours.   The anticipated award date is July 2006.    This is a new requirement and there is no incumbent contractor.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement and is for informational purposes only.     THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS OR BIDS.     The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, requests comments concerning its proposed plan  for c ontracting the construction of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) Replacement, Stage 1, located at Fort Detrick, Maryland.  The government will consider these comments and plans to issue the formal solicitation in t he fall of 2006. The United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) is the vanguard of the nation's capability to protect the U.S. military from battlefield biological threats.  It is the cornerstone of an emerging National Interagency Biod efense Campus consisting of multiple federal agencies conducting biodefense research at Fort Detrick.  Today, however, USAMRIID scientists and staff work in antiquated facilities that are overcrowded and require increasing levels of maintenance.  The Depar tment of Defense has committed to a recapitalization plan to provide new expanded facilities for USAMRIID.  The recapitalization will proceed in two distinct stages, with supporting/related projects.   The solicitation is for construction of Stage 1 of the Recapitalization Program.  Stage 1 will be an approximately 687,000 gross square foot facility, incrementally funded from fiscal years 2007 through 2010.  The NACIS Code is 236220 with a size standard of $31,000,000.  Estimated construction cost of work under this procurement is $300 to $400 million.  The facility is in the early stages of design and will include office/administrative areas, laboratories with biosafety levels 2 through 4, aerobiology, a nimal areas with animal biosafety levels 2 through 4, general building support, and all associated supporting facilities including parking. Construction is planned to begin when all required environmental approvals are received, currently expected to be la te summer of 2007.  The construction will be accomplished through multiple contracts, including set-asides for socio-economic programs.  Contracts for construction to be set aside for socio-economic programs will be procured separately and are not included in this solicitatio n.  The solicitation will be unrestricted and is planned to include all building core and shell, and fit-out of critical areas.  Work will be designed and packaged to support a fast-track construction scenario.  The government is still considering whether work under this solicitation will be awarded as either one or multiple construction contracts, and how the contracts will be structured. Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.     After review of the responses to this announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisitions, solicitation  announcements will be published in the Federal Business Opportunity for the respective projects.     NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.     All interested offerors will have the opportunity to respond to solicitation announcements at a later time.   This notice is to assist the Baltimore District, Corps of Engineers in determining potential sources only.     This sources sought announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information soli cited.     All interested contractors should notify this office in writing by mail, email or fax by 3:30, Local Time, 30 June 2006. Send responses to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, P.O.

<SUBJECT>R -- Development of a Database of Dietary Supplement Labels
<DESC>The Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), National Institutes of Health, seeks to issue a statement of work (SOW) to obtain services related to the design, development, implementation, maintenance, and enhancement of a new, publicly available, web-based application for cataloging all known dietary supplement labels sold in the United States in a database tentatively called Dietary Supplements Label Database (DSLD). The goal of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit feedback from capable vendors that will help finalize the SOW.  

The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of both Government requirements and industry capabilities.  The pre-solicitation conference is to be used to 1) disseminate background data that offer further insight into the size and complexity of this acquisition, as well as the risks of undertaking this project, 2) clarify and inform the development of a detailed statement of work, and 3) discuss anticipated difficulties.  

A complete and comprehensive source of information containing virtually all dietary supplement labels does not currently exist. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) supplement label database is incomplete, as it contains only supplements reported by survey respondents.  The need for DSLD is apparent from numerous communications of stakeholders, from Congress, and deliberations within the ODS. It is hoped that an existing Federal database can be further developed so as to allow the research community and other interested stakeholders free access to dietary supplement label information.  

Such an application is needed as a resource both for research and educational purposes. The need for a complete, comprehensive, publicly available and readily accessible source of total label information and data is increasing as sales and use of dietary supplements grow (Radimer K et al, Am J Epi 160:339, 2004).  ODS believes that industry cooperation is essential to obtain complete coverage of all dietary supplements sold in the United States. 

The ultimate NIH goal is a DSLD containing label information for all products marketed and sold through all distribution channels in the United States. This would meet the research and informational needs of research investigators, health professionals, Federal and state agencies, and consumers. Researchers conducting epidemiological studies would find the dietary supplement database application useful in estimating total exposures to various dietary supplement ingredients and their associations with health outcomes. Researchers planning clinical trials require information on dietary supplement content for calculation of interventions involving them and in assessing and planning dietary intakes. Federal and state agencies need information on the content of dietary supplements to estimate current intakes and to plan nutritional interventions and recommendations. 

DSLD would also meet the needs of other segments of the dietary supplement community.  Dietitians would be able to obtain information on the composition of dietary supplement products for computing dietary intakes of nutrients or other bioactive constituents. Health professionals would be able to search for ingredients with beneficial or adverse effects. Industry might find product formulations or comparisons with competitive products of interest. Policy makers might find the application useful for calculating the contributions of various dietary supplements to total nutrient intakes. 

The immediate goal of this Request for Information is to identify capable vendors and solicit ideas on the development processes so as to inform the finalization of a Statement of Work.  An integral part of this work is understanding and defining both the technical components and processes and the project management components and processes. 

ODS anticipates a 12-month requirements (feasibility) development effort.  Requirements development should be approached by the vendor becoming familiar with other Federal research efforts in this area for the purposes of interfacing.  At its completion, ODS requires a report defining the feasibility of continuing this effort into its design phase and delivery of a prototype dietary supplements label database.  

It is important that the DSLD interface well with existing databases, especially the NHANES/ NCHS/CDC survey dietary supplement label database and the USDA/ARS standard reference database for food composition, in order to maximize the utility of the DSLD for the government, researchers, and the public. 

Contractors expressing an interest should provide appropriate capability statements.  The capability statement shall include the following: 
1) Description of the organization’s experience and past performance with large, complex databases for use in research
2) CV’s for key personnel, including the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement.  
3) Description of the vendor’s ability to access labels and required information in order to populate the DSLD, including a sampling plan to demonstrate the ability to capture the full range of products in the marketplace. 
4) Sample content (both nutrient and non-nutrient) to be included in DSLD. 
5) Steps to ensure accuracy and quality of information in DSLD, including how to deal with complex issues such as a) capturing digital images of labels, b) methods to identify products with a unique number or code to facilitate product identification building on those already in use in other Federal databases, c) methods to distinguish among such factors as validation of quantification of true zeros, missing data, etc., d) methods for verifying the validity of information contained the sample labels, e) methods for converting the label information into units compatible with those in other Federal government databases, f) documentation of how changes in labels will be documented promptly in DSL D, g) documentation of likely challenges anticipated in developing DSLD, such as use of structured vocabulary or dictionary of synonyms, and h) methods for freezing data for archiving and reporting. 
6) Plan for producing a DSLD prototype at the conclusion of a forecasted 12-month requirements development effort.
7) Outline of how DSLD will integrate with the existing National Center for Health Statistics NCHS/NHANES Dietary Supplement Database and the USDA Standard Reference Food Composition Database.  
8) Detailed summary of the process to be used in requirements development.
9) Examples of user-interface design completed on projects of similar size and/or complexity.
10) Discussion of preferred programming code to be used during program code construction.
11) Discussion of effort and experience involved in system testing and quality assurance testing.
12) Copy of certified level of maturity, as it related to CMMI: Capability Maturity Model Integration
13) Names and numbers of three references from former clients involved in an effort of similar size and/or complexity including contract number, contract type, dollar value for each customer, reference and customer point of contact with phone number, and title of individual.

<SUBJECT>A -- RCC TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND TIMING GROUP MEETING
<DESC>The Range Commander’s Council (RCC) Telecommunications and Timing Group (TTG) is launching a new committee to develop interface standards for the transmission of IRIG 106 Chapter 4 serial streaming telemetry streams over IP and ATM network infrastructures.  The goal of this effort is to use existing standards where feasible and develop the application interface definitions to allow for interoperability between vendors.  The goal is not to deprive vendors the ability to customize and add features as required by their customers, rather to ensure a non-proprietary migration and consistent support for serial streaming telemetry over flexible commercial network infrastructure being deployed at the test ranges.  All interested vendors are invited to participate in this meeting.  This is intended to be a collaborative effort between government, contractors, and the vendor community to identify the minimum interface definitions to allow and ensure interoperability and balance bandwidth overhead against the ability to reserve interface features to allow vendors to provide proprietary value added features to meet unique needs of specific customers.  The Range Commanders Council (RCC) 114th Telemetry Group (TG) and the 107th Telecommunications and Timing Group Conferences will be at the Embassy Suites Hotel, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, 15920 West Valley Highway, Tukwila, WA 98188.  You may go to their website (www.embassyseatac.com) for more information.  This working group meeting is expected to last about a day and half convening Wednesday, 23 August.  Registration is required to attend this conference.  For detailed information on this meeting please contact Jim Pilkerton at jim.pilkerton@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>S -- Wastewater Privatization
<DESC>Notice of intent to privatize the wastewater collection utility system at Dover AFB, Delaware pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2688, as a sole source procurement with the local utility provider, Kent County.  The Government’s intent is to convey the utility system and award a long-term firm fixed price utility services contract.  On 17 November 2003, a Request for Proposal, SP0600-04-R-0004, was issued as a competitive procurement to privatize this system.  Two proposals were received but were deemed to be unacceptable.  In accordance with Department of Defense Guidance for Privatizing Defense Utility Systems issued on 09 Oct 2002, the local utility provider, Kent County, was contacted to determine if they would be interested in entering into an agreement with the Air Force to privatize the wastewater collection system at Dover AFB, Delaware.  As this procurement will now be a non-competitive action, this sole source negotiation will be accomplished under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304©(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, which allows for the use of other than competitive source selection procedures when only on responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<SUBJECT>99--Intent to Establish a Qualified Manufacturer's List for Measurement Services
<DESC>Intent to Establish a Qualified Manufacturers List for High Pressure, High Flowrate Flow Measurement Services

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Metrology Institute of the United States, intends to establish U.S. National Measurement Standards for high-pressure, high gas flow rate measurements, disseminate these to U.S. industry, and, in concert with Na-tional Metrology Institutes (NMIs) of other nations, establish levels of equivalence of national measurement standards of the participating NMIs.  Of particular interest is the capability to establish such standards and calibration service in natural gas used in commerce. 

To establish these U.S. national gas flow rate measurement standards, NIST seeks to identify private sector entities that have flow measurement calibration and research facilities, in natural gas and other gases, and expertise to establish the U.S. National Measurement Standards.  

Qualified suppliers must be able to provide NIST with access and use of facilities with the capabilities listed below. Such access is required in a timely manner, and will utilize the operat-ing and technical expertise of the supplier’s personnel to safely and effectively operate the facilities for the purpose of establishing flowrate measurement standards and the calibration of flow meters in a range of sizes.  

The supplier’s facilities must be in the continental United States of America.

Given the rather demanding requirements of the services desired, qualified providers may have capabilities that do not meet all of the maximum values or dimensions as stated below, but do have capabilities that cover a significant portion of a parameter range. To better classify accept-able capabilities, acceptable ranges of variation are designated by tiers. 

First tier suppliers must have capabilities at or above the maximum values given for the various operating capabilities described below.  

Second tier suppliers may have restricted ranges of some parameters as described below.

TESTING FACILITIES CAPABILITIES
1. Provision of gas flows at operating conditions of:
a. Operating Pressure – Both tiers; Testing over the commonly encountered ranges of oper-ating pressures found in pipeline transportation of natural gas in the U.S. is desired.
	Maximum –  6.7 megapascals (67 atmospheres; 1,000 pounds per square inch (psi)) or above;
	Minimum – 4 megapascals (40 atmospheres; 600 psi);

b. Operating Temperature Range – Both tiers
	Normal ambient temperatures or a range of 4 degrees C to 50 degrees C (39.2 de-grees F to 122 degrees F) at time of operations.


2. Meter Test Section Dimensional Requirements:   Sufficient to install the meter to be tested and a minimum length of upstream piping, of the same nominal diameter as the meter, equivalent to 40 diameters of the metering element or greater. Upstream piping is to be straight and unobstructed.  The facility is to provide such piping. Upstream piping should be capable of supporting installation of flow conditioning devices of various lengths and types.
a. Pipe Diameters
	First tier -  25 mm to 762 mm (2 inches to 30 inches);
	Second tier – 25 mm to 300 mm (2 inches to 12 inches);
b. Length – Both tiers
	A minimum of 40 diameters of the internal diameter of the meter to be tested is required to be upstream of the meter. Flow conditioning capabilities at the entrance of the upstream piping are desirable and may be required in cases where the excessive swirl conditions may be induced in the flowing stream by piping configuration immediately upstream of the 40 diameter, or greater, piping upstream of the installed meter.

3. Gas density determination. This may be based on composition measurement capability supporting computation. Direct measurement of the density of the flowing gas at operating conditions is acceptable if the measurement uncertainty of the gas density can be documented to be below 0.01%.
a. Natural gas
      Capability for determination of gas composition using gas chromatographic analysis of up to six carbon atoms per molecule is required in addition to nitrogen and carbon dioxide concentration determination. Composition of natural gas varies as that normally found in commerce in the United States.

4.  Flow rate established over the pressure temperature ranges stated above.
a. First Tier – 500 to 20,000 cubic feet per minute
b. Second Tier – 500 to 2,000 cubic feet per minute

5. Flow rate control capability – Both Tiers
         Ability to establish control of the rate of flow through the meter test section such that the variation in flow rate does not exceed 5% of the nominal rate for test periods of 15 minutes. 

6. Expertise in operations of flow meter calibration facilities – Both Tiers
a. Demonstration of such expertise includes:
	The provision of flow meter calibrations to external or internal customers on a regular basis, e.g., a minimum of 10 meters per year constitutes a threshold.
	Publication in the flow metrology technical literature, particularly in the area of measurement uncertainty analysis of the systems and facilities considered here.

7.  Measurement uncertainty analysis and quality system documentation – both tiers
a.  Demonstrated by at establishment and use of a quality system.
	Facilities will demonstrate experience in quality system documentation conform-ing to the ISO 17025 or similar standard.
b. Accreditation by a recognized U.S. quality system accreditation body, e.g., the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program or the American Association of Laboratory Accreditation, constitutes acceptable levels of demonstration.

8. Measurement uncertainty documentation for the flow measurement standards and facilities – both tiers:
	Facility staff will work collaboratively with NIST staff to augment, where neces-sary, both measurement uncertainty analysis of the flow standards to be establish such that this documentation meets NIST’s requirements for provision of its measurement services. Such requirements are available upon request or may be found at www.nist.gov

9.  Direct access to high-speed Internet connections facilitating remote data acquisition and control of measuring instruments that NIST may place at the facility – Both Tiers.

10.  Demonstrated capability to safely install flow meters of various types up to the largest diameter capability of the facility – Both Tiers.

11.  Test sections that are protected to some degree from temperature excursions caused by the weather – Both Tiers.

12.  Capability to house and protect U.S. government-supplied equipment necessary for success-ful operations – Both Tiers.
a.  Buildings near to, or housing, the test sections which are suitable for the locating and sheltering the installation of NIST-supplied instrumentation and test equipment necessary to the meter calibration operations. 
b. Physical security for NIST-owned equipment is required to ensure that it is not damaged or its operation impaired during facility operations not associated with NIST-related ac-tivities or when the facilities are not operational.
c. Environmental requirements
	Temperature – 65 degrees F to 75 degrees F.
	Relative Humidity – 30 percent to 80 percent.

13. Multiple geographic sites – Both Tiers.
a.  Multiple sites are acceptable, but will require additional resources over a single site. In-stallation at multiple sites will be a point for additional negotiation.

INSPECTION OF FACILITIES
NIST reserves the right to periodically examine the facilities and technical capabilities of quali-fied manufacturers to determine if they meet the minimum requirements

NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS OF MEASUREMENT CAPABILITIES
Successful suppliers must be willing to must work with NIST personnel to effect changes to facilities to meet the NIST criteria for its measurement services. Cost of modifications will be negotiated as needed.

ACCESS TO SUPPLIER FACILITIES AND INTERACTIONS WITH SUPPLIER STAFF
NIST staff will require access to the facilities supplied for the purposes of equipment installation, upgrading, and maintenance.  NIST staff may be on-site for the purposes of monitoring opera-tions associated with meter calibration on an as-needed basis.

EVALUATION OF SUPPLIER CAPABILITY - REQUIRED SUBMISSIONS
The capability of Contractors shall be determined through site visits and review of the documentation described below.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Lee Technologies for a base plus four (4) one year option periods under the provisions of Far 6.302-1, for maintenance and repair of the uninterrupted power supply and associated cooling system. Services on the power supply and cooling systems are essential to CIT being able to provide services during power losses; and ensure that those services will continue to run, and that data will not be lost. Many highly critical administrative and research oriented Departmental and IC programs rely on CIT’s ability to keep the multitude of systems up and running on a 24x7 schedule.

Capability Information

The Government will assess the capability of each offeror on the basis of the following evaluation factors which are of approximately equal value:  (1) Organizational Experience and (2) Organizational Past Performance. The Government will not assess capability on a pass/fail basis, but will use its assessments of capability as a basis for comparing offerors to determine best value.

 (1) Organizational Experience. The Government will evaluate each offeror's organizational experience on the basis of its breadth, its depth, and its relevance to the work that has been priced. However, the Government will consider the extent to which the offeror's key personnel have worked together in the past. The Government will evaluate the organizational experience of the offeror's proposed key subcontractors.

(2) Organizational Past Performance. Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror satisfied its customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The Government will contact some of each offeror's customers to ask whether or not that: (1) that the offeror was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) the offeror's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract (specifications); (3) finished within the contract time; (4) the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during performance; and (5) the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction. In evaluating past performance, the Government will contact some of the references provided by the offeror and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  Federal, state, and local government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic data bases.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for services being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in Seattle, Washington intends to acquire the following services:

Statement of Work


.

  Background and Objective:  The NWFSC provides scientific and technical support to NOAA Fisheries for the management, conservation, and wise use of the Northwest region’s marine and anadromous species.  The Conservation Biology Division provides technical support and conducts research related to the conservation of marine organisms.   

The objective of this project is to determine if there are cryptic species within the single currently recognized northern abalone species (Haliotis kamtschatkana ), by assessing levels of variation in "speciation genes" which mediate species-specific fertilization in abalone.  The northern abalone is considered a potential candidate for ESA listing due to a severe decline in abundance that has occurred over the last several decades.  An essential first task in conducting an ESU status review is to correctly identify the unit that is being considered for listing.  For invertebrates, such as abalone, this unit must be a species or subspecies.

    Description:  

Task1:  Sample collection.  Obtain as many samples of northern abalone as possible (and no fewer than 20), focusing on extremes of the range. Samples may be collected by the vendor and/or obtained from existing collections.  Newly collected samples shall consist of small tentacle clips that do not harm the individual sampled. 

Task 2:  Genetic analysis.  DNA shall be purified using standard methods. The genes for egg VERL and its interacting sperm protein lysin have already been sequenced from northern abalone [4,5], and these sequences shall be used for designing species-specific primers. Additionally, abalone-specific mtCO1 primers have been developed [6], and these shall be used as well. The contractor shall PCR and sequence the N and C terminal regions of the VERL gene, the coding sequence of the lysine gene and the mtCO1 gene from all individuals collected in Task 1.  Sequencing shall be be performed using standard methods (e.g., ABI BigDye v3.1 an analyzed on an ABI3100 automated sequencer). The contractor, in consultation with the NWFSC point of contact, shall test for population differentiation using standard phylogenetic and population genetic criteria (e.g., those described in  the documentation to the computer program PHYLIP (http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html).  



    Deliverables

Monthly phone or email updates to the CBD point of contact on the status of tasks 1 and 2.

3.2 A final report in standard scientific form (methods, results, discussion), including an electronic database of all data collected.  The database shall include processed sequence data from all genes collected for all samples, all sequencing electropherograms, and all data related to sample collection (exact location and date for each collected individual).  All individuals sequenced shall be identified with a unique numeric code, and this code shall be associated with all data collected on the individual.

INTRODUCTION 

Title II of the Agricultural Trade and Assistance Act of 1954 (P.L. 480), as amended, appropriates resources intended to combat hunger and malnutrition through support to activities that raise the level of availability, access, and utilization of food in recipient countries. This position is located in the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance, Office of Food for Peace (DCHA/FFP). The Office of Food for Peace reports directly to the DCHA Assistant Administrator and provides program oversight for U.S. Department of Agriculture P.L. 480 Title II funds administered by USAID.  DCHA/FFP manages over $1.2 billion in annual food aid and employs a combined direct-hire and non-direct hire staff of over 60 in Washington and overseas offices.  The Office is comprised of four divisions; Emergency Programs (FFP/EP), Non-emergency or Development Programs (FFP/DP), Policy/Technical (FFP/PT), and Programs Operations (FFP/POD). Under the guidance of the Office Director and his Deputy, FFP manages the largest budget in USAID.  

The Division Director, either DCHA/FFP/EP or DCHA/FFP/DP, provides policy direction. The Incumbent acts as a Team Leader in a geographic program division.  Incumbent independently plans and carries out projects, coordinating the work with other Agency personnel, agencies within the U.S. government, the World Food Programme (WFP) and Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs). Contacts may be characterized by their unstructured settings and by the flexibility of approach and breadth of subject matter.

Project accomplishments are reviewed with broad USAID policy and responsiveness to the needs of the FFP program and Bureau objectives. Guidelines consist of laws and legislative initiatives, Agency and Bureau rules and regulations, and legislation governing the use of U.S. food assistance. Incumbent must exercise considerable judgment in determining the application of current legislative provisions and executive policies to assigned responsibilities.

The work requires the application of broad processes related to planning and developing food aid programs. Issues are often characterized by unusual demands of the vital role that food aid plays in meeting the emergency and short-range needs of the hungry. The necessary analytical skills require full awareness of program complexities and changing economic, social, political, security and programmatic circumstances in which the effective use of resources remains under constant review and assessment. The purpose of the work is to participate in planning USAID worldwide food assistance programs to combat hunger abroad. The position requires a high degree of initiative, originality, foresight and judgment to assure effective implementation of the purposes of P.L. 480.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.  Assesses Title II food assistance needs in assigned region, balances competing food aid needs, develops proposed regional and country allocations of funding, and works with FFP senior leadership to obtain necessary resources.

2.  Establishes the terms and conditions for Title II food assistance strategies, proposals and programs, and ensures that they are consistent with FFP and Agency policy and legislative guidelines and with accepted programming principles and practices

3.  Develops specific food aid programs, identifies appropriate cooperating sponsors, and allocates funds over the course of the fiscal year to maximize program effectiveness.

4.  Coordinates on needs and programs with USAID field staff, other USAID offices and bureaus in Washington, WFP, PVOs and others to ensure complimentarity and appropriateness of FFP programs.

5.  Independently represents FFP in USAID and interagency working groups on contingency planning, development of new initiatives, foreign aid coordination for region assigned.

6.  Maintains liaison with senior officials from within USAID, the U.S. government, WFP and PVOs to keep them fully informed about FFP programs, policies and procedures, and to discuss and resolve mutual problems.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions from a potential offeror.  The questions and answers are as follows:


1.	Regarding the tilt platform, Specifications1.0(d) and 6.0(b), while a platform is desirable, it is not fully understood why a tilt platform is required.  Can you elaborate?

A tilt platform is necessary to level a sample before profilometry.  NRL often processes samples of non-uniform thickness, whose base and front surface are therefore not parallel.  A tilt stage is needed to compensate for variations in height due to non-uniform thickness.

2.	Specification 6.0 (e) indicates that the controller software must include stitching.  This statement is not clear.  The Chromatic Aberration (CA) technology allows for complete area profiles without joining images(stitching).  The stitching requirement is understood when the interferometric principle is used.  Please clarify.

By stitching, NRL refers to how CA can obtain area profiles.  Area profiles are obtained by joining (stitching together) line scans taken by stepping at intervals along the y axis.  Stitching is intended to identify how area scans are to be made from CA line scan joining.
