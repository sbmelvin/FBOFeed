<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with MTI MicroFuel Cells, Inc., 431 New Karner Road, Albany, New York 12205 for the purchase of two (2) M30 Fuel Cell Evaluation Kits.  These systems must contain the following requirements:  power output - 150 watts, output voltage - 24 to 34V, size/weight - 1.5 liter/1.5 kg (w/o rechargeable Li battery), and refill cartridges – for 5000 Wh operation, each kit.   The man-portability requirement has placed an extreme demand on efforts to reduce the weight and volume of the terminal.  A battery power source is an essential part of the design, and mission requirements for deployment of the terminal will necessitate soldiers carry on the order of 30 lbs of batteries alone, if conventional power sources are employed.   The direct methanol fuel cell battery technology we are proposing to purchase will provide the same amount of portable power in a package that only weighs about 7 to 8 pounds.  Since the target weight for the entire satellite terminal is under 25 pounds, it's clear that this new state-of-the-art technology is absolutely essential to meet program goals.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) plans to procure editorial, graphic design, translation, printing and distribution services support for the production of magazines and other printed supplements.  This requirement is 100% set-aside under the Small Business Act, as amended by Section 8(a) utilizing the guidelines of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 19.8.   Only eligible Section 8(a) concerns that fall within NAICS Code 541430 -Graphic Design- may submit a proposal.  The Government intends to award a definitive contract using firm fixed price payment provisions on a non-personal service contract basis using the policies contained in FAR Part 12.  The contract term will consist of a base period plus four year option years.  The tasks  include:  (1) editorial services, graphic design, translation,  printing and distribution of  five quarterly magazines, plus irregular supplements (that range from large, medium to small in size), surveys, and activity planner and/or other products for each Geographic Combatant Command (US NORTHCOM, US SOUTHCOM, US PACOM, US CENTCOM, and US EUCOM). (2) Magazines and other products will be produced in at least three, or as many as five foreign language(s); English, Spanish, French, Arabic, and Portuguese as determined by US SOCOM and Geographic Combatant Command (GCC) in order to meet the requirements. (3) The contractor will provide an on-site Editor to each GCC location, to provide a single point of contact for issues surrounding each magazine. (4) US Government Secret Level Security clearances are required for some of the contractor’s employees. Solicitation issue date is expected to be o/a March 22, 2006.  The government goal is to incorporate the production of the five magazines into one contract. The government is also aware of the complexity of this effort due to the language and place of performance requirement;  for those reason the government will contemplate a multiple award if it is determined that is in its best interest.  No telephone requests for copies of the solicitation will be accepted. Requests for a copy of solicitation may be by e-mail via the Contracting Specialist, Sandra Ortiz at sandra.ortiz@socom.mil.  Award will be made on other than low cost or on a best-value basis. See numbered note 1 and 13.

This data must include sufficient information to allow the Coast Guard to evaluate the proposal relative to the above requirement.  The Coast Guard does not intend to pay for information solicited.  The submission of this data for review shall not impede award of a contract.
A firm, fixed price  contract consisting of a base year plus four option years is anticipated.  Estimated quantities for each year will be shown in the solicitation.  FOB Destination to the USCG ELC, Receiving Room, Bldg 88, 2401 Hawkins Point Road, Baltimore, MD 21226-5000.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) anticipates award of an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) to provide anti-corruption services for the Office of Democracy and Governance in the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).   The purpose of this contract is to provide USAID and its partner countries with the broad range of technical assistance necessary to develop and implement appropriate and meaningful strategies to fight corruption and ensure accountability in public life.  USAID defines corruption as “the abuse of entrusted authority for private gain.”  This activity focuses on unilateral abuses by governmental officials such as embezzlement and nepotism, as well as abuses linking public and private actors such as bribery, extortion, influence peddling, and fraud, and at both lower and higher levels of government and the public sector (i.e., both “administrative” and “grand” corruption).  The activities to support the strategic approaches to fighting corruption under this contract are expected to encompass the following functional areas: (a) public financial, administrative and regulatory measures that promote transparency and accountability; (b) civil society advocacy on behalf of governmental integrity; and (c) incorporation of anti-corruption promotion into other sectoral/sub-sectoral areas, such as health and education, corporate governance, or into key aspects of democracy promotion, such as rule of law, legislative oversight or local government strengthening.  In addition, the Contractor shall award and administer, upon task order request, a small grants program to support indigenous nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in pilot or experimental activities as well as provide institutional strengthening support, as appropriate, to the recipient NGOs.  USAID estimates awarding five (5) contracts as a result of this solicitation, including 4 unrestricted and one small business set-aside.  USAID anticipates that the maximum ordering limitation of the contracts resulting from this RFP will be $500,000,000 over the five (5) year ordering period.  Note that this ceiling applies across all contracts and cannot be exceeded in the aggregate; each successful contractor will be eligible to compete on all task orders until the shared ceiling for all contracts is reached.  There is no guarantee on the number of contracts awarded, the number of task orders that any one firm will receive, or the amount of money each firm is entitled to beyond the minimum monetary amount stated in the RFP. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541990.  The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fedbizopps.gov) not less than fifteen (15) days after this notice is issued.     In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor.  No phone requests will be accepted, no solicitation will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed.  Questions must be directed to Ms. Ryan Johnson, Contracting Officer, U.S. Agency for International Development, M/OAA/DCHA/DOFDA, Ronald Reagan Building, Room 7.09-146, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave, NW Washington, D.C. 20523, (Phone: 202-712-1185) (Fax: 202-216-3132) (email: ryjohnson@usaid.gov).

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has a requirement for Economic Growth, Agriculture, and Trade international activities. The resulting suite of contracts will be called Global, Business, Trade, and Investment II (GBTI II). The USAID Bureau for Economic Growth and Trade (EGAT) is dedicated to reducing poverty and promoting prosperity in developing and transition countries.  EGAT is the USAID operational unit with a mandate to address development issues in economic growth, agriculture and trade in the developing world. Economic Growth (EG) is an office within EGAT, mandated to assist USAID field offices to develop and implement economic growth programs. EGATs goals are to raise incomes, end hunger, protect the environment, and equip institutions and people with the knowledge and skills to build equitable and sustainable economies and societies. USAIDs primary program objectives focus on devising and implementing robust strategies to promote real economic growth, reduce poverty, graduate transitional countries from aid to trade, promote open and competitive markets, develop the private sector, and expand and mobilize private financing sources to supplement and eventually replace development assistance.  Contractors shall be expected to provide a full range of services to USAID Missions and to USAID/Washington in substantially all major areas of business, trade and investment development and reform. USAID intends on awarding several Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQCs) through an unrestricted and restricted (small-business set-aside) best-value competition.  The IQCs will have an ordering period of 5 years. USAID anticipates issuing the solicitation on or about July 20, 2005 with an estimated response date of August 22, 2005. For solicitation number M-OAA-EGAT-EMD-05-1529 proposals will be accepted from all responsible sources.  For solicitation
M-OAA-EGAT-EMD-05-1534 proposals will only be accepted from small businesses.  A small business is not limited to submitting a proposal under both solicitations but only one award will be made.

<DESC>The NHLBI intends to negotiate with Rees Scientific Corporation for a sole source contract award.  The award will provide all services and materials necessary to maintain in optimal performance a scientific freezer alarm system installed within the Louis Stokes Laboratory, Building 50, on the campus of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. The performance period will consist of a base year plus four successive one year options for a total of five years. 
The freezer system was originally included as a construction component of the building and has been operational since the facility opened  in 2001. Rees Scientific has successfully maintained the system since its installation. It is comprised of a complex framework of over 400 devices as well as accessories, probes and ancillary wiring that monitors lab freezer temperatures throughout the building. The freezers contain biological research samples that are extremely heat sensitive, some of which are more than 50 years old and cannot be replaced.  Should the system malfunction and the samples thaw, the damage to the progress of the research would be irretrievably lost. Award to another contractor for a replacement system would require the development/installation of a configuration that parallels the current structural parameters of the Rees alarm.  Consistent sample temperature control of the research samples during installation would be of utmost importance.  The cost associated with maintaining the current system during the transition in addition to costs associated with the development and installation of a replacement would well exceed the sole source cost of this award to Rees Scientific Corporation.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 561621 and the size standard affiliated with this code is $11.5M.  As stated above, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306-302-1. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement within 30 (thirty) days after publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Comments to this announcement should reference solicitation number, NHLBI-PS-2006-124 and should be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6150B, Bethesda, Maryland 20814-7902, Attention: Sharon Cummings.

<DESC>On December 23, 2005, Landsat Program Management received a memorandum from the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) revising the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) procurement strategy.  As a result, NASA is considering issuing a solicitation for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for a free-flyer spacecraft mission.  Further, NASA is planning a single award for the development and delivery of a spacecraft, instrument, observatory integration and test, and operational systems/sustaining engineering support.  NASA is planning to provide launch services for the observatory and accept delivery on-orbit.  The LDCM will have a 5-year mission life with 10-year expendable provisions.  In addition, NASA plans to issue the solicitation with an optional requirement for the instrument to observe a portion of the thermal spectrum. It is critical to the Landsat program that the potential for schedule success is maximized. To this end, NASA is considering including financial incentives for a timely delivery.  Following a prescribed on-orbit acceptance period, NASA plans to transfer ownership of the observatory and the associated contract to the USGS who will then operate the spacecraft and manage the data. NASA is seeking industry comment regarding this proposed acquisition strategy.  Please submit any comments to the NASA Contracting Officer within 5 business days from the date of this notice.  Additional opportunity for industry comment will be provided when the draft RFP is released for comment.  It is anticipated that the draft RFP will be released in the second quarter of Calendar Year (CY) 2006 and a final RFP in the third quarter of CY 2006.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services is providing notice of the recompetition of contract N01-AI-95388. This current contract it titled, “Sexually Transmitted Diseases Prevention - Primate Unit.” In this recompetition, the NIAID looks to further the development of topical microbicides aimed at the prevention and control of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) through pre-clinical testing in nonhuman primates. Also, the contract will expand to include testing for topical microbicide efficacy against Trichomonas vaginalis, SIV/SHIV, and other sexually-transmitted infectious organisms as new animal models are developed and validated. This contract will aid the development of candidate topical microbicides and prepare them for clinical trials and eventual licensesure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The nonhuman primate animal models for STIs and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/Simian-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV/SHIV) infection represent a valuable paradigm for studying infection and disease, prevention strategies, and therapeutic interventions. This crucial, but limited, nonhuman primate model resource is reserved for: (1) studies that cannot be addressed in small animal models (parameters not feasible in small animals for prevention of sexual transmission); (2) topical microbicides or therapeutic prevention approaches where "proof of concept" in a primate model would provide critical information to stimulate further development and evaluation in clinical trials; and/or (3) testing of candidates that have proven most promising in small animal models, or candidates in an advanced stage of development that require further evaluation.

Safety and efficacy evaluation in nonhuman primates of topical microbicides represents one step in the product development pipeline. DMID and the NIAID Division of AIDS (DAIDS) support an integrated product development program with the goal of developing topical microbicides for the prevention of HIV and STIs.  Additional information on NIAIDs topical microbicide development program is provided in the following links: NIAID Topical Microbicide Strategic Plan - http://www.niaid.nih.gov/publications/topical_microplan.pdf; DMID/STI website - http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/stds/; INTEGRATED PRECLINICAL/CLINICAL PROGRAM FOR TOPICAL MICROBICIDES - http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-03-137.html.  

The NIAID plans one (1) contract award for a term of seven (7) years on or about April 2, 2007.  A cost-reimbursement completion type contract is anticipated.  RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-07-18 will be available electronically on or about March 6, 2006, with a closing date tentatively set for July 6, 2006, and may be accessed through the NIAID Request for Proposals home page at:  http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract/rfps and will also be posted on FedBizOps.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect call will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>A -- HHS Pilot Program for Radiation Monitoring in Hospital Emergency Departments
<SOLNBR>RFP06EASPHEP06084
<ARCHDATE>03312006
<CONTACT>Michele Namoski, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-2475, Fax 301-443-3238, Email snamoski@psc.gov - Michele Namoski, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-2475, Fax 301-443-3238, Email snamoski@psc.gov
<DESC>The Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP) through the Program Support Center (PSC) has a requirement for the development of radiation monitoring of patients for radioactive contamination.

Under Emergency Support Function #8 of the National Response Plan, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for coordinating the Federal response for public health and medical issues for Incidents of National Significance involving weapons of mass destruction (WMD), including radiological dispersal devices (RDDs).  An RDD event could result in many patients presenting to hospital emergency rooms who may not realize that they have been radioactively contaminated.  Therefore, it is important that hospitals are able to adequately monitor patients for radioactive contamination as early as possible following an incident, in order to properly triage and treat the patients and to protect hospital staff and property.

To address these concerns, HHS has undertaken a program to develop guidelines for radiation monitoring in hospital emergency rooms.  A subgroup of the HHS Radiological Dispersal Device Medical Response Working Group was convened, consisting of experts in health physics who reviewed the types of radiation detection instrumentation currently available and recommended a system of wall-mounted radiation area monitors utilizing sodium iodide detectors.  This Health Physics Subgroup obtained a set of two sodium iodide-based area monitors linked through a software system to a laptop PC to test the system’s response to various radionuclide sources in order to optimize the operating parameters of such a system for use in an emergency room setting.  Having arrived at a set of operating conditions for the area monitor system, the system will now be evaluated under real world conditions in 3 hospital emergency departments. 

The goal of the project is to assess the utility of the system in a hospital emergency room setting including ease of installation, operation and maintenance, instrument response, data collection, computer networking and alarm functionality.  The system will be evaluated under normal operating conditions, as well as during mock incidents with sealed radioactive sources.  Special attention should be paid to the potential for false positive alarms.  The project will also evaluate issues of staff training and response.  The project will conclude with an emergency response exercise simulating the medical and health physics response to an RDD by hospital staff.  The period of performance will be approximately 16 months.  

The radiation monitoring system shall consist of two Ludlum Measurements, Inc. Model 375-10 digital wall-mounted area monitors (or equivalent) connected in parallel to a PC via an Ethernet connection.  These monitors must utilize 2x2 inch sodium iodide scintillation detectors with a low energy discriminator set at 300 keV in order to eliminate most radionuclides used in nuclear medicine and thus reduce the rate of false positive alarms.  The monitors must operate on AC current but shall come equipped with auxiliary battery power to allow for eight hours of operation without AC power.

The detectors must be mounted on each side of the entrance to the emergency room at an approximate height of one meter from the floor.  The power supply shall either be connected to an existing outlet or hard-wired.  Appropriate routing of Ethernet cables shall be necessary in order to be able to monitor the detectors remotely at a PC workstation (i.e., located in the Radiation Safety Office).  Software included with the detectors must be downloaded to the workstation.

The area monitors must be equipped with two LED displays for low and high alarm settings.  The low alarm setting shall be determined by first collecting a background reading for each detector for 24 hours.  The low alarm shall then be set at a value equal to the average background plus two standard

Three Turn-Key Radiation Detection Kits shall be constructed to include radiation detection devices, protocols, training information (CD’s), and access to on-line training.

The Contractor will demonstrate successful experience with: Using a radiation detection device in a hospital emergency department setting.  Designing and instituting training programs to include internet-based and other technologies.  Evaluating hardware and software systems in emergency department settings.  Working in a senior leadership position in an Emergency Department.  Designing projects or studies across multiple institutions.  Evaluating training experiences.  Experience performing the required tasks.  Communicating effectively during interactions with all levels of individuals. Communicating in a written format i.e., writing letters, memoranda, reports, etc., to include government-style correspondence and reports related to public health and emergency management.  The need for specialized technical expertise in working with radioactive materials and detectors. The requirement for an understanding of how Emergency Departments function to include human factors issues.  The ability to successfully negotiate for the placement of three (3) systems in Emergency Departments within a 65 mile radius of HHS HQ and for two (2) additional test sites. 

The project shall be performed in three (3) hospital Emergency Departments (ED) as follows:

1.	All must be located within 65 miles of HHS HQ.  
2.	One location shall be within seven (7) miles of HHS HQ. 
3.	Contractor’s hospital system must have a minimum of two (2) EDs.
4.	At least one (1) ED must be a Level One Shock-Trauma Center in a facility which administers radioactive isotopes. 
5.	HHS will identify two (2) additional EDs in which to pilot equipment and procedures.  


The solicitation will be posted 15 days after this posting.  All questions regarding this requirement shall be e-mailed to Michele Namoski, Contracting Officer.  The solicitation will be posted on this website and no hard copies will be issued.  The RFP Number for this requirement is 06EASPHEP060084.  Proposals will be due 45 days after issuance of the solicitation.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Jerome M. Mouton, Manager: Marketing & Strategic Business Development, NAMPORT, No. 17 Rikumbi Kandanga Rd., Walvis Bay, Namibia, Phone: 264-64-208-2207, Fax: 264-64-208-2323.  Namibia Port Development and Expansion Technical Assistance.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for the Namibia Port Development and Expansion Project.

Namibia has two ports, Walvis Bay, in the center of the country’s Atlantic coast, and Luderitz in the south, near the border with South Africa.  They are controlled by the Namibian Ports Authority (NAMPORT), a quasi-governmental agency.  Walvis Bay and Luderitz offer attractive opportunities as transshipment hubs or outlets for several of Namibia’s landlocked neighbors and an attractive alternative to central and northern areas of South Africa.

The principal reason the port wishes to plan new investments now is to be able to handle increased demand resulting from other transportation developments in the region.  The Walvis Bay Corridor Group, a group formed from private transport associations, including NAMPORT, is sponsoring the development and use of rail and road corridors from Walvis Bay and Luderitz through Namibia and into its landlocked neighbors.  TransNamib, the government-owned transportation company, is expanding and extending the rail links from Walvis Bay to Windhoek, the nation’s capital, and to Angola and Botswana.  The Trans-Kalahari (into South Africa) and Trans-Caprivi (through Botswana into Zambia) Corridors are partially completed and are being extended.  These Corridors, made up of road and rail links, are expected to be the main routes for cargo movements for Namibia and its neighbors.  NAMPORT anticipates substantial increases in port activity from the traffic these Corridors will attract, and thus is working to improve and expand the ports.  

The Grantee’s short-term objective is the optimization of existing facilities and operations, which would allow the Grantee to improve its competitive position and generate new revenues.  The technical assistance will include the following: a review of the ports’ information technology network and vessel tracking system; review of ports’ security systems; review of petroleum receiving facilities; interim presentation and reports; developmental impact considerations; preliminary environmental impact assessment; and final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $400,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, APRIL 10, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The U.S. Government Accountability Office intends to issue a non-competitive contract for one year with the possibility of four one year options with American University, 400 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington DC  20016-8083 for the Washington Internship for Native Students Program (WIN). GAO contemplates a base year with four option years (fiscal years 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010).  The Washington Internship for Native Students provides opportunity for GAO to participate in the American University Washington Internship for Native Students Programs.  The structure of the WINS program uniquely fits GAO’s college relations strategy to expand internships during the school year.  No other program would allow GAO to incorporate a focused recruitment effort to hire Native American students under a recruitment umbrella at one of our National Recruitment Schools.  GAO has experienced considerable difficulty in recruiting and hiring Native Americans.  The students will conduct research and interviews and summarizes observations and facts in writing;  apply analytical methods to data to identify patterns, trends, or irregularities; researches aspects of the design matrix or project plant to assist preparation of audit plans;  assist in maintaining proper documentation of job management and project files;  contribute to drafting written products;  participate in meetings with GAO and agency officials to gather information or communication progress or results of work.   American University WIN program is the only provider that GAO intends to solicit and negotiate as the sole source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  GAO’s point of contact for this acquisition is Deloris Ennis, Acquisition Management, U.S. Government Accountability Office, 441 G. Street, NW, Washington, DC  20548 or email Ennisd@gao.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   However, all proposals received within a forty five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the government not to compete with this proposed contract upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  (See Numbered Note 22.)

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to modify contract number 0600-03-60130, Evaluation of the Ticket to Work Program - Part A, Evaluation Implementation, to add two tasks: (1) rebuild the Ticket Research File (TRF) in 2006 with SSA data through December 2005, and (2) update the ticket data analysis from the 2005 report (which uses data through Dec 2004) using the updated TRF data.  The contractor, Mathematica Policy Research Inc. (MPR), has developed, built and analyzed the TRF in 2004 and 2005, and under the terms and conditions of the aforementioned existing contract, will develop, build, and analyze the TRF a third time in 2007.  Where the TRF must now be built and analyzed for 2006 using data through December 2005, it is critical that this be accomplished in the next 6 months, of which MPR is the only source capable of meeting that timeline based on their knowledge and experience in constructing and analyzing the TRF since 2004.  BACKGROUND: On May 29, 2003 SSA awarded a 5-year contract to MPR for preparing data files from SSA administrative data and conducting the adequacy of incentives evaluation, process evaluation, participation analysis, and impact/outcomes analyses for the evaluation of the Ticket to Work Program.  REQUIREMENTS: MPR shall rebuild the TRF in 2006 with SSA data through December 2005. MPR shall then use this updated TRF data to update the findings from the second ticket to work evaluation report regarding the impacts of the ticket to work program on SSA benefits, SSA program participation, SSA program exits due to work, and use of SSA work incentives. Interested sources that believe they have the capability to perform the services required within a 6-month time period (i.e., to be completed by October 2006), should submit a capability statement to Dawn Caracci via email at dawn.caracci@ssa.gov. Responses shall be marked TRF for 2006, CAPABILITY STATEMENT, and shall be received no later than March 8, 2006, 3:00PM EST. All responsible sources will be considered. If no responses are received by the cutoff date, a modification will be issued directly to the MPR contract referenced above. All questions must be submitted in writing to Dawn Caracci via the email address listed above. Telephone calls will NOT be accepted. Reference Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>BOSS HSCG23-06-R-HXZ001  VENDOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

FedBizOps POSTING:  22 FEB 2006

1.  Q:  In Section L.6, Volume I, the solicitation asks for a Transition/Resource Management Action Plan.  Can you provide any of the following sizing metrics in order to help us more clearly define our starting point for the transition?

Estimated current number of claims by USCG location (Mobile, Morgan City, New Orleans, Port Arthur).  
A:  No claims are being adjudicated at any of these locations.

       Current staffing levels by location (Mobile, Morgan City, New Orleans, Port Arthur).
       A:  Mobile:  2  Morgan City:  1  New Orleans:  2  Port Arthur: 1

       2.  Q:  Can you please provide us with a list of specific applications and tools currently being used to      
       support claims?  

A:  Each claims support requirement is unique, and involves a separate task order containing a statement of work, contractor labor category hours, schedule, and work product deliverables that are tailored for that specific claim.  As part of its ongoing business operations, the NPFC utilizes all Microsoft Office products (Word, Excel, etc.) as well as a customized ORACLE data base.  Any modifications or changes to these tools would be linked to a requirement under a contract task order. 

3.  Q:  What percentage of total labor hours on this contract do you anticipate being dedicated to Attachment G/Katrina – related cost documentation support activities in the base year?  How is this expected to change in each option year?

A:  The percentage of total labor hours among task orders issued under the BOSS contract that are dedicated to Katrina related cost documentation support activities in the base year or any option year is not predictable, as other requirements may arise during the base year that require the contractor to perform additional, simultaneous task orders with other labor categories under the contract.  The Government anticipates continued performance of Katrina related cost documentation support services following award of the BOSS contract, but changes between this requirement and other additional, unknown future requirements are not predictable, and cannot be predetermined. 

4.  Q:  In Section L.6, on page 86, under Volume I, you state that “Offerors must show how they intend to furnish resources for seamless, uninterrupted performance for on-site Katrina cost documentation services upon award of the contract, in accordance with the requirements of Section J, Attachment G, and applicable sections of the BOSS SOW (Section J, Attachment A).”  What do you consider the applicable parts of BOSS SOW, Section J, Attachment A (pages 39-48)?

A:  Katrina cost documentation support services are considered “performance” under BOSS SOW 5.8.2, Incident/Case Cost Documentation Services. 
 
5.  Q:  In the solicitation, are you defining a full time equivalent (FTE) as 2,080 hours per year?

A:  Yes

6.  Q:  Page 3, Section B, Supplies or Services/Prices, includes Meeting Planner and Quality Management Specialist labor categories, however, there are no estimated hours provided for these positions on page 92 – 93.  Can you please provide this information?

A:  These two labor categories are not included in the pricing model described in solicitation Section M, Volume IV, Price.

7.  Q:  The estimated labor hours on pages 92 – 93 for the base year total 4,306 hours (slightly more than 
2 FTEs based on a 2,080 hour FTE year); however, Section J, Attachment G, Subsection 2.3.2, notes a resource need of 6 FTE’s for at least one year.  Please describe the relationship between the 6 FTEs noted in Attachment G, Subsection 2.3.2, and the labor hours provided on pages 92 – 93 for evaluation purposes?

A:  The 6 FTEs are estimates for future Katrina cost documentation support services.  The labor hours provided on pages 92 – 93 are for price evaluation purposes only.  See also answer to Question No. 3 above.  

8.  Q:  Understanding that the hours provided on pages 92 & 93 are for evaluation purposes only, can you elaborate on the basis for these detailed hours – in other words, are they based on historical information or a forecast?

A:  The hours are based mainly on historical information, and some on forecasted efforts

9.  Q:  In the cover letter dated February 8, 2006, you state that the estimated total quantity in $1,998,000.00.  Please describe whether or not this covers only the base year or if it also includes option years.

A:  The estimated total quantity covers both the base year and all option years.   

10.  Q:  What is the per year expenditure history for this contract for the past three years:  i.e. 2005, 2004, and 2003?

A:  2005 -  $758,012           2004 -   $613,904           2003 -   $228,733                   Total:  $1,600,649

11.  Q:  When looking at the incumbent contract with the Leads Corporation, I noticed the total value of the contract is $7,314,767.60.  In the synopsis for the new contract, it was indicated that this program was estimated at $2 Million.  Does this amount apply as a per year amount, or is it for the entire life of the contract including the option period years?

A:  The NPFC currently has two contract instruments in place with the Leads Corporation, an in-house IT support services order under a GSA Schedule contract, and the incumbent BOSS contract.  The total value of all the task orders issued under the incumbent BOSS contract is approximately $3,460,000.  The estimated amount of $1,998,000 for the BOSS contract is for the entire contract period, inclusive of the base year and all option years.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has a requirement for Economic Growth, Agriculture, and Trade international activities. The resulting suite of contracts will be called Global, Business, Trade, and Investment II (GBTI II). The USAID Bureau for Economic Growth and Trade (EGAT) is dedicated to reducing poverty and promoting prosperity in developing and transition countries.  EGAT is the USAID operational unit with a mandate to address development issues in economic growth, agriculture and trade in the developing world. Economic Growth (EG) is an office within EGAT, mandated to assist USAID field offices to develop and implement economic growth programs. EGATs goals are to raise incomes, end hunger, protect the environment, and equip institutions and people with the knowledge and skills to build equitable and sustainable economies and societies. USAIDs primary program objectives focus on devising and implementing robust strategies to promote real economic growth, reduce poverty, graduate transitional countries from aid to trade, promote open and competitive markets, develop the private sector, and expand and mobilize private financing sources to supplement and eventually replace development assistance.  Contractors shall be expected to provide a full range of services to USAID Missions and to USAID/Washington in substantially all major areas of business, trade and investment development and reform. USAID intends on awarding several Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQCs) through an unrestricted and restricted (small-business set-aside) best-value competition.

<DESC>The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, on behalf of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Alabama at Birmingham to extend and expand the scope of their current contract for an additional five years. The University of Alabama at Birmingham was originally awarded a contract for a five year period in September 2000 for a project entitled "Consortium for the Longitudinal Evaluation of African-Americans with Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (CLEAR) Registry." The purpose of this contract is to establish a registry (CLEAR) which serves to identify genetic and non-genetic prognostic factors of disease outcome using radiographic presence of bony erosions as the primary outcome measure (at 3 years disease duration).  The registry (400 completers) will serve as the basis for prospective analyses of factors predictive of the clinical phenotype and outcomes.  Four major academic medical centers in the southeast U.S. will gather data which will provide a resource for investigators interested in the genetics of RA in African Americans.  The Contractor will continue to 1) complete longitudinal evaluation of 400 African-Americans with early RA and 200 matched controls; 2) complete the 3 and 5 year disease duration visits; 3) enroll an additional 600 African-American subjects with RA and an additional 300 matched controls; 4) establish a cross-sectional cohort of 600 subjects; 5) collect clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic information; 6) obtain radiographs of the hands and feet at entry into the study; and 7) collect blood for serum, genomic DNA, and RNA suitable for microarrays.  Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302 1, University of Alabama at Birmingham is the only source capable of performing this requirement due to their prerequisite knowledge and experience because of their preliminary and current work. Due to the inherent duplication of cost and unacceptable delays in performance, a noncompetitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements, as described above.  A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is a RFP available. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>1)        Is the DOI currently performing tier 1 / level 1 support using federal employees? Tier 1 has varied usage, depending on the help desk area.  Federal employees are used solely on some desks, some feature federal employees with contract employees augmenting staffing levels, and others are fully contract staff or outsourced to vendors.  All help desk functions currently reside in-house. 2)        What are the percentages of applications running on UNIX, Sun Solaris, Windows, Linux, and Novell? This information cannot be provided as part of the RFI due to infrastructure complexity and the integration between application platforms. 3)        In the current support infrastructure, is there currently a "hand off" to a third-party vendor that provides on-site and desk-side support? The NBC has 	processes in place through the help desk software (ticketing system) with defined assignment / escalation groups which are used to hand off issues. 	Desk side support is currently on-site and has a defined assignment group. 4)        Will the DOI consider Help Desk as a small business set aside? The NBC is open to all potential options. 5)        Will cross teaming allowed? The NBC is open to all potential options at this point. 6)        Will the DOI provide reports pertaining to the current help desk infrastructure that will detail the number and classifications of calls?  If so, will that 	information be included with the RFP? Yes, the NBC will provide this level of detail if/when an RFP is solicited. 7)        What are the current staffing levels at Reston and Denver providing Help Desk Support The current staffing is a follows: Reston/DC - 9, Denver - 8. 8)        Does the DOI use a COTS package to manage assets and inventory? The NBC is currently working to populate the asset management module within the Remedy application. 9)        This Sources Sought Notice has many requirements and optional services.  What does the Government expect or anticipate will be funded in the base 	year of the contract? The NBC will be making this determination once the evaluation has been completed. 10)        What is the anticipated contract award date? This is still to be determined. 11)        Are there any requirements to support classified systems?  If so, what is the level of clearance required The NBC will require at a minimum a Background Investigation. A decision on the support of classified systems is pending. If classified support will be required, the requirements will be clearly outlined in a RFP. 12)        Does DOI currently use any other Help Desk software other than Remedy & HEAT? And if so, at what locations. Not for the current help desks being evaluated. 13)        How many end users are going to be supported by the Help Desk End user totals vary by line of business and the application(s) customers use.   Customers may also be cross-serviced between help desks. Example:  Personnel & Payroll Systems support upwards to 300,000 government employees, IT support includes these 300,000 customers from all other lines of business. 14)        Will an operational assessment be performed by the Project Manager upon contract award? Yes 15)        Are there any baselines established within current  SLAs to track customer satisfaction? Not at this time.   16)        Is there budgeted funding in place for a Knowledge Management System with the depth/breadth that the requirements are stating (100K+)?  Not 	at this time.   17)	 In that regard, is Knowledge 	Management a key function of this help desk or a separate process with a Knowledge Manager, Knowledge Engineers, etc This model is to be determined.  18)	How does the DOI intend to maintain quantifiable telephony performance metrics to ensure that the Contractor can achieve the desired performance? Part of the contractor solution will be the contractor's ability to produce performance metrics through technologies used.  Examples would be:  telephony, help desk software, customer surveys, knowledge management usage, etc.  The NBC understands the challenge based on the uniqueness of each line of business and will work with the contractor prior to implementation and establish regular meetings to discuss performance.  The NBC understands as business changes, performance requirements may need to be modified accordingly. 19)	Please map the seven Help Desks listed in the Current Volumes by Help Desk table on page 4 of the RFI, to the eleven Help Desks listed in the Tiered Service Model tables on pages 6 through 12 of the RFI, and the fourteen Help Desks listed in Attachment 1?  This will assist vendors in linking call volumes and hours of operation to the current service model. Page 4	Tiered Model	Attachment 1 Payroll	POD Information Line	Payroll Operations Division IT-Denver	IT Support Center	IT Service Center IT-DC/Reston	Technology Services Division	Technology Services Division Personnel / Time and Attendance	Federal Personnel & Payroll System, Quicktime	Personnel & Payroll Systems Finance	Procurement Desktop, Electronic Commerce, Financial Business Mgmt System, Travel Manager	PD Help Desk, EC Help Desk, FBMS Help Desk, Travel Mgr Help Desk, Bank Card, eTravel, Financial Systems HD DOIU	DOI University	 Data Warehouse	Datamart	Datamart 20)	Please indicate the Problem Management application used by each of the eleven Help Desks listed in the Tiered Service Model tables on pages 6 through 12 of the RFI?   The RFI provides this information for four of the eleven Help Desks.  That is, two Help Desks, Procurement Desktop and Electronic Commerce, use Heat, and two other help desks, FBMS and Travel Manager, use Remedy. HEAT					 POD Information Line Technology Services Division Federal Personnel & Payroll System, Quicktime Procurement Desktop  Electronic Commerce Datamart Remedy IT Support Center Financial Business Management 21)	The RFI indicates on page 14 that any Hosting Solution must integrate with, and be compatible with, Remedy, NBC's standard ticket system software. Is Remedy integration and compatibility also required for any Outsourced Solution? No, the NBC will evaluate all outsource solution options available. 22)	Does DOI require an Outsourced Solution to provide dedicated resources to support NBC and NBC customers, or, can the outsourced vendor's help desk personnel, hardware, and problem management software, and other infrastructure also be used to support the outsourcing vendor's other commercial and government customers? The NBC does not have the requirement to have dedicated resources.   23)	How do the ten general metrics currently used by NBC and outlined on pages 15 and 16 of the RFI relate to six items in Attachment 3 Performance Metrics Analysis?  These are examples of general metrics used across the different help desks. The NBC is looking to standardize and implement best practices in regard to performance metrics across the enterprise.   24)	Can NBC provide vendors with a general timeframe for the major milestones associated with implementation of the future vision as described in this RFI? Dates are premature at this point due to the many decisions yet to be made on this initiative. 25)	Is NBC considering  an Integrated Help Desk Solution or only  labor and hosting support for their in place Remedy solution? The NBC is considering all options, based on vendor core competencies. 26)	Will the future Help Desk be located on government property or off site? No decision has been made yet, this will be determined based on the final solution.  27)	Are you considering only contracting Level 1 (Tiers 0/1) Help Desk support ?  Yes at this time. 28)	Will any subsequent RFP be only for Help Desk or will it contain Managed Services for the Desktop support? The current target will be for help desk 29)	Will NBC be providing further information regarding their current Network Infrastructure and their Voice Communications environment? 	Further information will be provided if we issue a formal RFP 30)	Is there a Contract Vehicle in place for this solicitation? No, this is only an RFI 31)	Will this solicitation have a Small Business goal or a set aside provision? This has not yet been determined. 32)	Will it be part of a GWAC task order? This has not yet been determined 33)	Does this include any other Help desks within DOI? This only applies to the DOI National Business Center Is there an IVR currently in use at DOI? Yes, with limited capacity and capabilities. 34)      	Remedy is mentioned as the Helpdesk software selection moving forward.   Will NBC please elaborate and identify the version and the modules of Remedy that are deployed, or are scheduled to be deployed? The NBC has made an investment in the Remedy IT Service Management for the Enterprise (Version 6.0), which includes Remedy Help Desk (ARS version 6.3) , Change Management, Asset Management, and Service Level Agreements. However, the NBC is willing to entertain other product usage based on vendor capabilities.  Currently, Remedy Help Desk and Service Level Agreements have been deployed, but are not in use by all help desks.  Asset Management and Change Management are in the development phase for a future deployment.  35)	What other COTS technology tools (specific vendors and products) are employed at the NBC centers currently; for functionality with regards to: reporting, monitoring, workforce management, IVR, CTI, automated surveys   	Reporting: The NBC currently has reporting capabilities through 2 avenues.  1) Nortel PBX switch - Statistics are produced daily from the telephony switch. The NBC does not currently have the capability to store historical statistics, or monitor help desk agents in real-time.  2) Help Desk Software - The NBC uses Crystal Reports (Version 8.5) to produce custom reports from the help desk software for use internally and for distribution of customer requested reports. 	Monitoring:  The NBC's monitoring capabilities are currently 'system/infrastructure' focused versus 'service' focused.  The NBC utilizes BMC product suites and HP Openview toolsets to monitor and send alert notifications for system/infrastructure events.  	Workforce Mangement, CTI, Automated Surveys:  The NBC does not have these technologies or capabilities in the environment at this time.  The NBC has needs for this technology and is looking for solutions and best practices we can leverage through the RFI solicitation. 	IVR:  The NBC utilizes an Octel 300 for IVR and ACD capabilities.  The Octel 300 has exceeded it's lifecycle and replacement options are being evaluated.  36)	Will the NBC please provide its definition of what it sees as the Hosted Model?  Is that meant to mean NBC is hosting all the technology and application infrastructure at NBC centers, and the contractor is only providing the IT SMEs to manage it and run it. 	The NBC views a 'Hosted' Model as a vendor who provides the technology and infrastructure at vendor location(s). This would enable the NBC to potentially leverage the vendors core competencies and experience to manage the technology, gain cost efficiencies through sharing of technology resources (with other vendor customers), yet still managing the support staff internally at the NBC. 37)	Will the NBC please provide its definition of what it sees as the Outsourced model?  Is that meant to mean the contractor is providing all technology, application, and facility infrastructure as well as the IT SMEs to manage the systems, as wells as providing the staff for Tier 1 support? 	Yes, the NBC views the Outsourced Model as if a vendor has the capabilities to provide the facility, underlying technology and infrastructure (and support) and can perform Tier 1 call center support.

The MPTAS must have a digital display capable of being read from any position while attached to a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) approved litter (NATO standardization agreement for litters) with a casualty lying on top of the litter.  The MPTAS must also be capable of nighttime readability by a corpsman in the cargo hold of the aircraft without interfering with the pilot’s and aircrew’s operation of the rotary winged aircraft while the pilot and aircrew are wearing Night Vision Goggles. Electromagnetic Environment. The MPTAS must be airworthiness certified for use on USMC rotary winged aircraft and Hazards of Electronic Radiation to Ordinance (HERO) safe. Emplacement. The MPTAS must be an integrated device weighing 30-35 pounds and less than 1 Cubic Foot in overall size.  The MPTAS must also be capable of mounting upon a NATO approved litter without interfering with the medical administrative duties of a military corpsman while caring for a critically injured/ill casualty.  The MPTAS will typically be employed on board a USMC rotary winged aircraft in a combat environment.  Rotary winged aircraft will be the CH-53, CH-46, and the MV-22.  Mission scenarios/sorties are dependent upon the operational environment but the MPTAS must be useable in all environments and altitudes up to 10,000 feet. Mission Duration.

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e), not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) seeks to obtain information on an experimental control and data acquisition device for use in a variety of studies. The unit will be called the Clinical Neurophysiology Device (CNPD). A full copy of the draft Statement of Work (SOW)is available upon request to the Contract Specialist via e-mail. 

NINDS conducts and supports research, both basic and clinical, on brain and nervous system disorders. The main techniques employed in clinical research include transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), sensory evoked potentials, back averaging of EEG, magnetoencephalography (MEG), behavioral and kinesiologic studies, neuroimaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both normal volunteers and patients participate in experiments involving one or more of the above techniques. Typically, an experiment consists of presenting the subject with a set of stimuli and measuring his/her responses. The stimuli may be visual, auditory, tactile, or magnetic. The responses may be in the form of electrophysiological signals, voluntary or involuntary movements, voice response, or medical imaging data. The experiment can be as simple as monitoring the subject for a prolonged period of time without any stimulus presentation, or be as complex as having different types of stimuli presented in a randomized sequence, with real-time display and evaluation of the responses in order to provide feedback to the subject and/or the investigator (for example during training), or in case the investigator needs to alter the pattern of stimulation based on the subject’s responses. Once the experiment is completed, the response data must be displayed, processed, and evaluated. There is currently existing commercial equipment as well as systems built in-house that perform certain functions mentioned above and are suitable for the more simple experiments. However, there is no single system available from any source that can perform all the functions required. Hence, for a complex experiment, our researchers have to interconnect a number of these machines in order to accomplish what they need to do. Sometimes the interface between various machines is not available and an intermediary “box” (with electronic circuits) has to be built to allow the machines to communicate. This leads to space crowding in the lab, cable plugging and unplugging when switching between different types of experiments, potential errors resulting from possible timing delays between the machines, and more time spent in setting up and manual intervention during the experiment to ensure the correct order of events. This also complicates data analysis as we often have to export and import data from one machine to another to use the appropriate data processing software. A system which is user-friendly, powerful and flexible enough to handle a variety of experimental setups is required. NIH has a medical imaging facility to acquire imaging data, so this function is not part of the system design; however, some experiments have to be performed inside the MRI scanning room, so portability and MRI-compatibility also need to be taken into consideration.
The specific objective of this acquisition is for the design, development, and delivery of two complete hardware and software systems meeting the requirements detailed in the Supplier Requirements section to collect and analyze data, and two data processing stations that will be used off-line to display and analyze the collected data. These systems will allow researchers in clinical neurophysiology at NIH to perform a variety of experiments with ease and reliability. While delivery of two systems is the goal of this contract, it is anticipated that at least 8 systems will be desired at NIH if the product is satisfactory.

Please submit (3) copies of your response and provide comments on this requirement as if the period of performance is 1-2 years.

Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number RFI60001 may be submitted to the NIDA, SS/SA Branch, 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892, Attention: Roshawn Simpson. Facsimile and electronic mail will not be accepted. No marketing/capability statements unless it is in addition to the comments on the draft SOW. The Government is not establishing meetings with contractors nor is there intent for a pre-proposal conference. Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation. NIDA will not release any information marked with a proprietary legend received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies or individuals outside of NIH without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. A SOLICITATION IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command-Pacific is conducting market research to identify interested sources for information and planning purposes only.  We are seeking qualified and experienced sources for preparation of a marine species monitoring plan for Navy Operating Areas (OPAREA) and training ranges in 1) Hawaiian Islands, 2) Southern California, 3) Gulf of Alaska, 4) Pacific Northwest and 5) Marianas Islands.  Responses may be provided for any or all of these five areas.  All qualified and experienced contractors, non-profit organizations, academic institutions, state and federal agencies are encouraged to respond. The Hawaii OPAREA covers approximately 745,000 square kilometers, surrounding the main Hawaiian Islands as well as Kaula and Nihoa.  The OPAREA runs up to the Hawaiian shoreline off northwestern Hawaii, western Molokai, southwestern Kauai, at three locations around Oahu, and around the entire island of Kaula.  The offshore component is extensive, stretching beyond the limits of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in three locations.  The Southern California OPAREA covers approximately 411,000 square km and is located in the eastern North Pacific Ocean off the coasts of Southern California and Baja Mexico.  It includes a nearshore and offshore component.  The nearshore component encompasses ocean waters along the Southern California Coast, from Oxnard to just north of the California/Mexico border, as well as all of San Diego Bay.  The offshore component surrounds many of the Channel Islands, and extends in a southwesterly direction out to 125 degrees West longitude.  The Gulf of Alaska OPAREA covers approximately 82,000 square km and is located in the northern Gulf of Alaska southeast of Kenai Peninsula and northeast of Kodiak Island.  The Pacific Northwest OPAREA covers approximately 445,000 square kilometers.  The OPAREA has both an inshore and offshore component. The offshore component encompasses ocean waters along the coasts of Washington, Oregon and Northern California.  The inshore component includes the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the southern Strait of Georgia, and the entire Puget Sound.  The OPAREA runs up to the shoreline in portions of Puget Sound and the Quinault Area.  The Marianas OPAREA covers approximately 40,000 square kilometers and is comprised of both inshore and offshore components.  The inshore component contains nearshore areas of Guam, Tinian and Farallon de Medinilla.  The offshore component is a polygon extending southwest of Guam to approximately 10 degrees north.  Each particular OPAREA/range has specific baseline and monitoring needs depending on the current level of knowledge and data availability.  All methods of monitoring will be considered, including, but not limited to, aerial and shipboard surveys, passive acoustics, and individual-level behavioral studies, to form the foundation of the monitoring program.  Preparation of the plan is anticipated to include assessing current information (species composition, distribution, etc), modeling the movement and responses of a marine fauna in the OPAREA, investigating survey designs and analyses to assess potential effects of training.  Plan must be completed in coordination with Navy biologists and regulatory agencies, and on-site meetings will be required. The contractor must provide or contract all equipment and team members needed for the proposed study, monitoring and reporting of results.  Species to be included in the plan include marine mammals, sea turtles and commercially important fish.  Implementation of the plan, including systematic monitoring to assess trends in species composition, distribution, and abundance may follow plan preparation.  This announcement is open until 12:00 Hawaii Standard Time, 17 March 2006.   The Government reserves the right to make this requirement a set-aside.

<DESC>NOAA/ARL requires a Mercury Vapor Analyzer that meets the following requirements:

1. The analyzer shall be a compact, self-contained, rack mountable unit, complete with internal pump, user-serviceable pre-concentration traps, heaters, mass-flow meter & controllers, a cold vapor atomic fluorescence detector, and calibration source. It must be a portable unit that may be used indoors or in the field to monitor background vapor-phase mercury levels to a detection level in the *sub-ng/m3* regime at a cycle time of 5 minutes or less.

2. The analyzer must be capable of operation without an external data-logger or computer, and should possess analog, digital and RS-232 outputs to allow it to be integrated with a serial data-logger, PC-based data system or any air quality telemetry system.

3. The analyzer must be equipped with dual, gold-column amalgamation cartridges with allow for true, _continuous_ sampling of an air stream, with no gaps in the data collected. While one cartridge is sampling ambient air the other is in the process of being analyzed.

4. The mercury vapor cartridges should be made of pure gold, and should be able to withstand many thousands of sampling and desorption cycles without degradation in performance.

5. The duty cycle must be sufficiently short as to allow for near-real-time data collection, with a minimum rate of not more than 2.5 minutes per cycle.

6. The analyzer must be equipped with an internal mercury calibration source that allows the instrument to re-calibrate itself automatically; thus allowing unattended operation for extended periods of time.

7. The analyzer must be equipped with a bypass valve that prevents contaminated air from coming in contact with the detector, thus making cleaning operations infrequent.

8. The detector in the analyzer must have an inert gas purge feature to improve stability, thus necessitating only infrequent adjustments to the GAIN and SENSITIVITY controls.

9. The analyzer must utilize an electronic mass-flow meter or controller to measure ambient air sample flow rate. If using a mas flow meter, the analyzer must utilize a microprocessor controlled feedback loop between the mass flow meter and pump to ensure accurate sample flow rates and sample volume measurements.

10. The analyzer must use an electronic mass-flow controller to regulate carrier gas flow during analysis, and should automatically shut off gas flow in the event of a power failure. This allows optimal usage of the UHP Argon carrier gas.

In addition to the Vapor Analyzer, a Speciation Unit and Particulate Mercury Unit will also be acquired using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-8.  These analyzers must be sensitive enough to meet the needs of the ARL in measuring reactive gaseous mercury, elemental mercury vapor or particulate mercury in the atmosphere.  These analyzers must be rugged/stable enough to be deployed in the field and left unattended for long periods of time.

Any offeror who believes they can comply with the above requirements must submit a written narrative demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements within 10 days of this notice to Robin.Prather@noaa.gov.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion.

<OFFADD>Department of Energy, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (DOE Contractor), Industrial Partnerships & Commercialization, 7000 East Avenue L-795, Livermore, CA, 94550
<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Compound Thermoelectric Laminate for Energy Harvesting
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Compound Thermoelectric Laminate 
for Energy Harvesting

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to work with LLNL and UCLA scientists through LLNL to develop and commercialize autonomous power for small sensors and small electronic equipment by harvesting energy from abundant, low quality sources of heat such as solar, engines and electronic device operation.

Background: The basic concept of energy harvesting is to collect energy from solar or other “free” sources of thermal energy that exist in the environment and convert them to electricity. In principle, this technique could provide power from low quality sources of energy such as waste heat at low temperatures. A collaboration between LLNL and UCLA has demonstrated that a bulk compound thermoelectric laminate can convert thermal energy to electricity.  If  produced as a thin-film material and operated at high thermal cycling frequency the inventors believe that the power/gram produced by compound thermo-electrics prepared as thin films can potentially exceed that of current solar cells or other energy harvesting techniques. 

Description:  A LLNL and UCLA team has recently demonstrated and submitted a patent application for a new compound material that can directly convert thermal energy to electrical energy. Basic research is required before this newly invented material can be produced in the form of a thin film and tested at high frequency. The team is interested in partnering with a company from basic research and development through production of a manufacturing prototype.

Advantages:  
•	Obtain electricity from sources of “waste energy” rather than generated energy 
•	Sources of thermal energy are available even when the sun is not shining. These include sources such as car engines, laptop computers or hot asphalt.  
•	Scaled for very small devices
•	Continual source of power

Potential Applications: 

•	Provide power for small MEMS and NEMS devices.  
•	Provide power for remote sensors, remote actuators, etc
 

Feature	Benefit
Remote Power	Uninterrupted power supply. No need to change batteries
Tiny size	Cheaper, appropriately scaled, continuous power for small devices.

Development Status:  

This work is in an early stage of development, and will take significant joint research to bring to market. The inventors believe that the first task in a joint project should be the production of high quality thin films of the material. The LLNL/UCLA team would perform the basic research needed to understand the growth mechanisms under various thin-film techniques such as laser ablation and sputtering. The inventors plan to provide the partnership with basic property data and the effects of nano-crystalline structure using x-ray diffraction, magnetization, optical deflection and microscopy in order to achieve the production and processing of high quality films as well as the design of proof of principle devices at the MEMS scale.  The inventors are also interested in developing other related compound materials which they have identified as potentially having enhanced performance in energy harvesting.

LLNL is seeking industry partners with demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Energy Harvesting Technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.
Written responses should be directed to:

<SUBJECT>A -- Prototype Psychological Operations (PSYOP) Analysis Support Environment (PSYASE)
<DESC>Notice to to award a sole source contract.   The PSYOP Global Reach (PGR) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to award a sole source contract to University of Southern California Information Science Institute (USC/ISI) under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, (10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1)) (Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency’s Needs). 
The subject effort is to continue development of enhancements to the Prototype Psychological Operations (PSYOP) Analysis Support Environment (PSYASE).  This initial prototype was originally developed under a grant by USC/ISI.  The PSYASE software prototype has demonstrated the feasibility of using information agents and multi-agent simulation, as well as psychological modeling, in supporting analysis of target audiences (TA). 
This instant effort will continue enhancements that address extending the integrated components of the PSYASE prototype (information agents, natural language processing, information integration, ontology development, TA modeling and simulation, and other capabilities) to align them with the operational practices of the PSYOP operators and analysts. 
ISI’s Intelligent Systems Division has been engaged with government PSYOP subject matter experts (SMEs) for the past five years capturing the key elements of the analytical target audience analysis process and mapping this acquired knowledge to specific capabilities developed in PSYASE.
As a result of this engagement, USC/ISI is uniquely familiar with the software to be enhanced, the overall PSYOP process and the specific PSYOP capability needs to be addressed in the required enhancements.  Because of this experience USC/ISI is uniquely qualified to perform the required enhancements to the PSYASE prototype.  The Government anticipates award of an IDIQ type contract with a five year ordering period.  The total value of this award will not exceed $10M.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting USSOCOM's requirements as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 45 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be evaluated..  Responses to this posting must be in writing.  

This notice is not a request for proposal and may constitute the only official notice of this action.    See numbered note 22.  

All correspondence must be conducted through e-mail, no phone calls please.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) together with the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate, will sponsor a workshop to be held at the NIST campus, Gaithersburg, Maryland, on April 5 & 6, 2006.

This workshop will address important topics in automated searches of latent fingerprints. The primary focus will be on standardizing methodology for testing vendor latent search systems. The goal is to provide a methodology which is fair, protects vendor proprietary code and algorithms, while at the same time respecting privacy issues.  In addition to testing, other important topics such as “new generation” features, and latent image quality measures will be discussed.

Representatives from Government, law enforcement, industry vendors, and academia are invited.  

Additional workshop and registration information is available online at http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.03/latent , or you may contact Vladimir Dvornychenko at vdvorny@nist.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN06-21 - Proposer's Day for Super Resolution Vision System (SRVS) Program
<DESC>PROPOSERS’ DAY CONFERENCE
DARPA will host a Proposers’ Day Conference in support of the BAA 06-23, Super Resolution Vision System (SRVS) program on March 9, 2006 at the Executive Conference Center, 3601 Wilson Blvd., Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22201 from 8:00am to 7:00pm.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the SRVS program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

The forthcoming SRVS BAA will encourage proposals to include (but are not limited to) specific areas of technology.  DARPA is interested in proposals to design, build, and field a prototype man-portable optical system that will credibly extend the range for target recognition and identification over existing systems.  The key technical innovation is to exploit an atmospheric turbulence-generated micro-lensing phenomenon through collection of a stream of high-speed images to generate better-than diffraction limited images.  DARPA is interested in proposals that utilize state-of-the-art optical and computational technologies to exploit this turbulence-generated micro-lensing phenomenon, which will facilitate new operational and tactical opportunities for land forces.  Proposals must culminate in a field demonstration of a prototype system scaled to in-service system size, weight and power.

The BAA will request proposals for the full scope of development (e.g., an end-to-end system designed by a team of multidisciplinary research organizations, plus an integrator for coordination and implementation support).  Proposals addressing only individual component-level technologies will be considered nonresponsive to this BAA.

Potential proposers are encouraged to use the Proposers' Day to discuss their organization's capabilities and explore teaming arrangements with other conference attendees.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>GRP Appraisals

The Natural Resources Conservation Service in Missouri is requesting quotes for appraisals for land located in Adair, Benton, Cass, Lawrence and Pettis Counties that may be placed under a conservation easement through the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP). The purpose of the appraisals is to provide an opinion of market value of the entire subject property (larger parcel) before acquisition of an easement (before value) and an opinion of market value of the entire subject property remaining after the proposed easement has been placed (after value) as of a current date of value. The appraiser shall recognize that in a before and after appraisal, the partial interest being acquired is not actually being appraised. What is appraised is the larger parcel before and after the conveyance of the partial interest.  

The purpose of two opinions of value is to establish the effect on value resulting from imposition of a conservation easement. The price of the easement is the before value of the entire property (larger parcel) minus the value of the entire property as encumbered a Conservation Warranty Easement Deed, after value, provided there are not adjustments such as excess irrigation water rights explained below, which would equal the price of the easement. A key concept in this appraisal process is defining the larger parcel is required to begin the appraisal process. The appraisals must be completed in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and Supplemental Standards issued by NRCS. If you are interested in providing a quote for services, please download a copy of the solicitation at this website or contact the Contracting Officer at joan.clarkston@mo.usda.gov.

<DESC>GRP Appraisals

The Natural Resources Conservation Service in Missouri is requesting quotes for appraisals for land located in Adair, Benton, Cass, Lawrence and Pettis Counties that may be placed under a conservation easement through the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP). The purpose of the appraisals is to provide an opinion of market value of the entire subject property (larger parcel) before acquisition of an easement (before value) and an opinion of market value of the entire subject property remaining after the proposed easement has been placed (after value) as of a current date of value. The appraiser shall recognize that in a before and after appraisal, the partial interest being acquired is not actually being appraised. What is appraised is the larger parcel before and after the conveyance of the partial interest.  

The purpose of two opinions of value is to establish the effect on value resulting from imposition of a conservation easement. The price of the easement is the before value of the entire property (larger parcel) minus the value of the entire property as encumbered a Conservation Warranty Easement Deed, after value, provided there are not adjustments such as excess irrigation water rights explained below, which would equal the price of the easement. A key concept in this appraisal process is defining the larger parcel is required to begin the appraisal process. The appraisals must be completed in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and Supplemental Standards issued by NRCS. If you are interested in providing a quote for services, please download a copy of the solicitation at http://www.mo.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/contracts.html or contact the Contracting Officer at joan.clarkston@mo.usda.gov.
