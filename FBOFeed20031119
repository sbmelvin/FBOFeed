<DESC>Under authority of U.S.C. 253©(1), FAR 6.302-1, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, Maryland intends to procure from Highway Information Systems, 4021 Stirrup Creek Dr., Durham, NC  27703, a Highway Radio Advisory System.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561621, and the business size is $6.0.  This system shall include, but not be limited to, and meet or exceed the following performance characteristics, features, and pertain to the following components:  (1)  This HAR system will consist of a low power AM radio transmitter system together with various message signs (VMS) located on campus and flashing beacon signals located off-campus.  Both the VMS and flashing beacon signs will be portable and be able to be transported throughout the campus or off-campus locations and be electronically controlled from one of two workstations.  (2)  The low power AM radio will have a feature that permits messages to be broadcast by a pre-recorded message, or in a "live" mode.  The pre-recorded option allows for one message or by periodically cycling through a series of messages.  Messages can be changed remotely from either a touch-tone telephone or by computer.  (3)  The broadcast range is usually four to six miles away.  This range allows NIH to maximize the target audience on major traffic arteries serving the campus.  (4)  Messages are played in a continuous loop and will last from one to three minutes in duration.  Under normal conditions, a motorist should be able to listen to two messages while passing through the broadcast zone.  The message could include special event information, parking information, and more importantly, emergency information.  Because the transmitter broadcasts on the AM radio band, virtually every car radio is able to receive the signal.  The radio broadcast can be directly linked to several variable message signs (VMS) that could be mounted in several locations on the NIH campus.  VMS signs, in conjunction with the radio broadcasts, permit traffic advisories to be sent without delay.  The VMS sign would direct motorists entering the campus to designated parking areas in the event of a special event.   VMS signs placed at exit locations could direct motorists to alternative exit portals.  In the event of an emergency, the VMS signs could assist motorists with appropriate advisory messages.  (5)  These signs are legible from 650' to 700' and are visible from 1000'.  (6)  The signs are acceptable for use as provided for by the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).  (7)  The system can be used on a daily basis as an information source for employees.  In the event that NIH needed to be evacuated, it will be an effective component of the NIH evacuation plan to safely help guide individuals from the campus in an orderly fashion.  (8)  Also, another component of the system potentially allows it to be utilized as a security alerting system.  This feature may be tied into a network of real time monitors that are observed by the ECC staff.  If problems are observed, the ECC can swiftly activate the appropriate message for commuters.  (9)  It is anticipated that flashing beacons and alert signs will be placed on major traffic arteries leading to the NIH campus.  For example, placement of a beacon/sign along the Capital Beltway will advise motorists of traffic problems leading onto the campus so that motorists can alter their route and continue to the campus with minimal disruption.  Future coordination efforts and approvals may be required from the Maryland State Highway Administration, Office of Traffic and Safety, or other local jurisdictions such as the Montgomery County Department of Public Works and Transportation.  These will be initiated in order to erect signs at off-campus locations during deployment periods.  (10)  To activate the flashing beacon lights, a 900-megahertz paging system must be utilized.  The NIH radio shop through our CIT group can support these capabilities.  (11)  The VMS signs can be controlled remotely through a cellular modem or cellular digital packet data (CDPD) modem, our CIT group can provide this service in-house.  The communication link to be used will be determined based on available cellular CDPD coverage areas for VMS deployment.  (12)  The radio system must not interfere with any of the current NIH radio systems that are in place.  Additionally, it must not interfere with any of the scientific equipment that is continuously being used in the main hospital or in any of the laboratory buildings on the NIH campus.  (13)  The antenna and grounding system must be properly installed.  NIH will be working closely with the manufacturer and having the CIT radio shop personnel work directly with vendor during all planning and installation phases to prevent interference.  (14)  To operate the HAR system on the NIH Campus, the following equipment is necessary: (a)  Hiway Max Pole-Mounted, Dial-up HAR AM Broadcast System with Battery Backup, (b)  Portable VuPointe 450 Variable Message Sign with high efficiency amber light providing twenty-four (24) character display in a 3 X 8 matrix, (c)  Central Control Software Package and includes license for 1 workstation operating as a stand-alone system, (d)  Central Control Software upgrade to allow for the control of the National Sign manufactured variable message sign, (e)  HIS On-Site Computer Engineering Services Installation Package.  This includes on-site installation and one-day of training on operation of softwareand (f)  HIS Technical Support for three year service contract;  and (15)  to expand the HAR onto local commuting arteries, the following beacon system and signs would need to be incorporated Flashing Beacon System for roadway sign and Roadside "Tune to Alert" Signage and capable of being operated by two separate work stations, all controlled by one computer software package.  HIS will handle all FCC licensing requirements for the NIH.  Concerns that respond to this synopsis shall furnish concise responses directed specifically to the requirements mentioned above and are invited to submit capability statements in an ORIGINAL PLUS TWO (2) no later than fifteen (15) business days from the date of this announcement.  Written responses shall include complete description of the equipment to be provided, containing sufficient technical information to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the stated requirements as listed above.  CAPBILITY STATEMENTS SHALL BE SENT TO:  (a)  If mailing your capabilities through the U.S. Postal Service use the following address:  National Institutes of Health, Office of Logistics and Acquisition Operations, OA, 6011 Executive Blvd., Rom 529-T, ATTN:  Carol Hayden, Bethesda, MD  20892, telephone:  301-402-3340; fax:  301-402-7494.

A) Background 

Nigeria has a population of approximately 135 million people and is the most populous country in Africa. A politically stable and economically strong Nigeria is in the vital interests of the United States due to its oil resources, potential market for American products, its role as peacekeeper in the region, and it’s potential to further economic development of the region. However, neither civilian nor military governments in Nigeria have been able to grow the economy, or to diversify it from almost exclusive dependence on crude petroleum exports.

Oil exports generate $12 – 18 billion in revenues per year, accounting for at least 95% of foreign exchange earnings and over 75% of Federal Government revenues.  However, when examined in the framework of Nigeria's domestic economy, oil plays a much less prominent role. The manufacturing sector contributes only about 13% of GDP and agriculture comprises about 40%. Oil is capital rather than labor intensive and generates less than one percent of the country’s employment, directly benefiting no more than 5%of Nigerians. While Nigeria has large, sprawling cities, and is rapidly urbanizing, the majority of the poor still live in rural areas. Therefore, the key to generating broad-based economic growth is through the non-oil sector, including agriculture.

USAID/Nigeria Country Strategic Plan, 2004-2009

USAID/Nigeria has recently been approved to implement a development strategy for 2005-2009. One of the Strategic Objectives (SOs) will be “Improved Livelihoods in Selected Areas”. This SO will address core problems of low productivity, lack of competitiveness, an inconsistent policy framework, and an unfavorable environment for investment and enterprise development that are stifling the Nigerian economy.  The SO will identify key agricultural commodities and other products to enhance their competitiveness, productivity, and commercial potential.  Farmers and micro, small and medium entrepreneurs in selected geographical areas will be the targeted beneficiaries. Farmers will improve productivity and increase net incomes through greater access to improved inputs, processing technologies, and marketing options provided through commercial agribusinesses and producer associations. Input suppliers and processors will expand their activities through improved technical and management skills.

A growing number of self-sustaining microfinance institutions and an increasingly sophisticated financial system will offer small businesses and consumers an increased range of financial services, including loans and savings options. More use will be made of improved agricultural inputs, and there will be greater processing to add value to bulk commodities. Policy reform efforts will target issues of agricultural inputs, budget transparency and sectoral allocations, accountable government procedures, financial markets, a more open and competitive Nigerian trade policy, and a more favorable investment climate. USAID resources for this SO are very limited, particularly relative to the size and complexity of Nigeria. SO12 will influence government policy and resource allocation, and provide targeted assistance to increase farmer access to improved technologies, inputs and markets through the private sector.

The SO will be achieved through four intermediate results: improved productivity of selected commodities and products; increased value-added of selected commodities and products; increased commercialization of selected commodities and products; and an improved policy environment. The integration of agricultural productivity, market opportunities, value-adding processing, business development and financial services, as well as policy reform, is crucial, given multiple weaknesses and lack of support for the organized private sector. The SO will promote environmentally-sustainable agricultural production technologies to stem expansion of cultivation into fragile dry lands and tropical forests. SO12 will also exploit opportunities to link its interventions with those of other SOs to achieve synergies and leverage efforts in such areas as budget reform, rural finance, and the fight against corruption. The SO will address two Agency goals:  Broad-based Economic Growth and Agricultural Development Encouraged; and The World’s Environment Protected for Long-term Sustainability.




B) Role of the Private Sector Advisor

The Private Sector Advisor is a key member of the SO12 team, and will play a significant role in managing selected SO12 economic growth resources and activities. The Advisor will serve as the Mission spokesperson and expert on private sector growth, micro finance, and small and medium enterprise development in Nigeria. S/he will also take the lead in the area of agribusiness development, commodity marketing and trade, and investment. The Advisor will play a key analytical, advisory and project design and management role in implementation of USAID-funded activities in agribusiness, value-added agricultural processing and business development. In carrying out these functions, the Advisor will establish solid working relationships with colleagues in USAID, U.S. Embassy, GON, donors, NGOs, private sector and other key partners. The Advisor will serve as a leading advocate within the Mission for the establishment of public-private partnerships in order to leverage resources and enhance the impact of the Mission’s long-term development strategy.

A) Background 

Nigeria has a population of approximately 135 million people and is the most populous country in Africa. A politically stable and economically strong Nigeria is in the vital interests of the United States due to its oil resources, potential market for American products, its role as peacekeeper in the region, and it’s potential to further economic development of the region. However, neither civilian nor military governments in Nigeria have been able to grow the economy, or to diversify it from almost exclusive dependence on crude petroleum exports.

Oil exports generate $12 – 18 billion in revenues per year, accounting for at least 95% of foreign exchange earnings and over 75% of Federal Government revenues.  However, when examined in the framework of Nigeria's domestic economy, oil plays a much less prominent role. The manufacturing sector contributes only about 13% of GDP and agriculture comprises about 40%. Oil is capital rather than labor intensive and generates less than one percent of the country’s employment, directly benefiting no more than 5%of Nigerians. While Nigeria has large, sprawling cities, and is rapidly urbanizing, the majority of the poor still live in rural areas. Therefore, the key to generating broad-based economic growth is through the non-oil sector, including agriculture.

USAID/Nigeria Country Strategic Plan, 2004-2009

USAID/Nigeria has recently been approved to implement a development strategy for 2005-2009. One of the Strategic Objectives (SOs) will be “Livelihoods Enhanced in Selected Areas”. This SO will address core problems of low productivity, lack of competitiveness, an inconsistent policy framework, and an unfavorable environment for investment and enterprise development that are stifling the Nigerian economy.  The SO will identify key agricultural commodities and other products to enhance their competitiveness, productivity, and commercial potential.  Farmers and micro, small and medium entrepreneurs in selected geographical areas will be the targeted beneficiaries. Farmers will improve productivity and increase net incomes through greater access to improved inputs, processing technologies, and marketing options provided through commercial agribusinesses and producer associations. Input suppliers and processors will expand their activities through improved technical and management skills.

A growing number of self-sustaining microfinance institutions and an increasingly sophisticated financial system will offer small businesses and consumers an increased range of financial services, including loans and savings options. More use will be made of improved agricultural inputs, and there will be greater processing to add value to bulk commodities. Policy reform efforts will target issues of agricultural inputs, budget transparency and sectoral allocations, accountable government procedures, financial markets, a more open and competitive Nigerian trade policy, and a more favorable investment climate. USAID resources for this SO are very limited, particularly relative to the size and complexity of Nigeria. SO12 will influence government policy and resource allocation, and provide targeted assistance to increase farmer access to improved technologies, inputs and markets through the private sector.

The SO will be achieved through four intermediate results: improved productivity of selected commodities and products; increased value-added of selected commodities and products; increased commercialization of selected commodities and products; and an improved policy environment. The integration of agricultural productivity, market opportunities, value-adding processing, business development and financial services, as well as policy reform, is crucial, given multiple weaknesses and lack of support for the organized private sector. The SO will promote environmentally-sustainable agricultural production technologies to stem expansion of cultivation into fragile dry lands and tropical forests. SO12 will also exploit opportunities to link its interventions with those of other SOs to achieve synergies and leverage efforts in such areas as budget reform, rural finance, and the fight against corruption. The SO will address two Agency goals:  Broad-based Economic Growth and Agricultural Development Encouraged; and The World’s Environment Protected for Long-term Sustainability.

<DESC>The overall mission and goal of the Expeditionary Logistics Future Naval Capability program (ExLog FNC) is to identify those mature and evolving logistics technologies that, through focused investment, guidance and management, can be demonstrated to provide the required enabling capabilities. These capabilities will subsequently be available to the warfighter through a systematic transition to the acquisition process.  The products of the ExLog FNC must be capabilities that are ready for transition to the acquisition community.  In particular, the ExLog FNC intends to make a major impact on high capacity at-sea transfer which is identified as High Capacity Alongside Sea Base Sustainment (HiCASS) under this Announcement. HiCASS is intended to offer new approaches for fuel, cargo, vehicle and personnel transfer in a sea way while underway. It is intended to address both transfer between two large vessels and transfer from a large vessel to a small vessel. The full BAA is attached to this notice and is also available at the ONR Home Page www.onr.navy.mil under Business Opportunities.

<DESC>Availability of a prospectus for solicitation of offers to operate commercial services in Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area in Tennessee. The operation will include Rustic overnight lodging, dining room food and beverage, general souvenir sales and Horseback Stable service.  Gross revenues over the past three years have averaged approximately $121,042 - 129,000 annually. The term of this contract is expected to be six years, and will require a minimum franchise fee to be paid to the National Park Service of 5% of gross revenue per year. The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR 51 has determined that this is a qualified contract, within the meaning regarding determination of a preferred offeror, because gross receipts are expected to be less than $50,000 in the first year of the contract.  The current concessioner is not a 'preferred offeror'.  Therefore, if the current concessioner competes for this contract, and if the Park Service determines that a competing responsive proposal is the best proposal for purposes of contract award, then the current concessioner will not be given an opportunity to match the terms and conditions of the best proposal.  Offers must be received by 4:00 p.m. January 20, 2004. The Prospectus will explain the business opportunity, the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract, the proposal instructions, and the proposal package (including the selection factors).    There will be an administrative charge to recoup printing cost of $30.00 plus a $5.00 mailing fee for each prospectus. Please make checks for $35.00 payable to the National Park Service. Include a physical address (no post office box) and telephone number. All requests for prospectuses should be made in writing to Henry Benedetti, Chief, Commercial Services, National Park Service, AFC, 1924 Building, 100 Alabama Street, S.W., Atlanta, GA  30303. No telephone requests for the prospectus will be honored. Please note that no further information than that provided above is available through any other internet resources or links. Concession contracts are not contracts within the meaning of 41 USC 601 et seq. (The Contract Dispute Act) and are not service or procurement contracts within the meaning of statutes, regulations or policies that apply only to federal service contracts or other types of federal procurement actions.

<DESC>This request is being solicited on an unrestricted base.  This is an Architect-Engineer (A-E) service acquisition for a firm-fixed price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for a base period of one year and two option periods of one year each.  The NAICS Code is 541330.  A-E services are required for the preparation of estimating and programming, development of plans, specifications and cost estimates suitable for bidding and repairs, renovations, alterations, upgrades, possible replacement (new construction), and associated demolition work for various projects at Dare County Bomb Range, Fort Fisher and Seymour Johnson AFB in NC.  A-E services for these projects will be accomplished under Task Orders written against the IDIQ contract.  Construction cost ranges for these projects vary; however, it is not contemplated that the cost range for any individual job will exceed $10,000,000.  The selected A-E firm(s) will be required to participate in an orientation, scope of work and site visit meetings (when requested) within 7 calendar days after receiving the request for proposal for a project.  The fees under the IDIQ contract will not exceed $750,000 for any base or option period with the maximum task order amount of $299,000.  The guaranteed minimum for the IDIQ contract is $10,000.  The work involved is multi-disciplined and includes, but is not limited to architectural, structural, civil, environmental, electrical, fire protection and mechanical requirements.  Field surveying, landscaping design, and architectural rendering capabilities may be required.  Familiarity with English and metric system of measurements is required.  Disciplines and capabilities may be represented within the same firm or with consultants that regularly work with the primary firm.  The firm(s) must provide part-time and/or full-time on-site project specific construction inspection, contract administration and field engineering services.  The firms(s) must provide full and/or part-time on-site design and plan review by professional engineers and/or architects on an as-needed basis.  All drawings must be formatted in AUTOCAD Release 2000 or higher.  Documentation shall be furnished with each drawing file detailing level layer usage, and scale information for drawings.  Each final drawing shall be provided on CD-ROM, formatted for the Windows operating system.  The firm(s) shall also be able to obtain MaxView/SourceView software and convert drawing files formatted for electronic posting over the Internet.  Each converted drawing file shall be provided on CD-ROM, formatted for the Windows operating system.  Firms are reminded of the requirement in FAR 36.601-3(a), which states that the construction design specifications shall require the maximum practicable use of recovered materials considering the performance requirements, availability, price reasonableness, and cost-effectiveness.  The possibility of hazardous materials, i.e., asbestos, lead paint, and other materials may exist at project sites.  All hazardous materials licenses and/or accreditations necessary for the locality of the project site are required by the A-E firm(s) or their  sub-contractors.  The general intention is to provide for such design and engineering services as necessary to support the procurement of construction requirements/ acquisitions.  For the Government to retain maximum flexibility in the interest of their clients, various services/products, such as technical reports, studies, site investigations, concept designs, cost estimates, surveys, shop drawings reviews, construction consultation and inspection, Title II, preparation of construction record drawings, and O&M manuals, may be required at any time up to final acceptance of all work.  Because the IDIQ contract could eventually result in an award over $500,000, a subcontracting plan will be required by large business concerns.  All contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receiving a contract award.    
B.  SELECTION CRITERIA:  Selection criteria to be utilized are listed in the relative order of importance as follows:  1.  Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction and the use of recovered materials; 2.

Professional capacity to complete projects within the established time limits, meeting project dollar thresholds, and current work load; 4.  Ability to provide part-time and/or full-time on-site project specific construction inspection, contract administration and field engineering.  Ability to provide full and/or part-time on-site design and plan review by professional engineers and/or architects on an as-needed basis.  5.

Historical dollar value and magnitude of requirements performed; 7.  Demonstrated capacity of preparing drawings on Computer Assisted Design Drawings (CADD); 8.

<DESC>The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) has a need for program management and oversight office services in support of the Iraq Infrastructure Reconstruction Office (IIRO).  Two solicitations will be issued by the Pentagon Renovation Program on behalf of the CPA and IIRO.  The first solicitation will be for program management and oversight office services for the overarching Project Management Office (PMO).  The PMO will oversee and manage six separate Sector Project Management Offices (SPMO).  The second solicitation will be for Program and Construction Management support of the SPMOs.  Each Sector corresponds to a Ministry within the Iraqi government:  1) Transportation and Communications Sector; 2) Electricity Sector, 3) Buildings/Health Sector, 4) Security/Justice Sector, 5) Public Works/Water Resources Sector, and 6) Oil Sector.  The PMO/SPMOs are responsible for Financial Management, Contracting, and Programming (program, project, and construction management).  Accordingly, the PMO/SPMO contractors will be required to provide expertise in these areas.  One award is anticipated under the PMO solicitation and multiple awards are anticipated under the SPMO solicitation (one award for each of the six sectors).  Each cost plus award fee contract will have a performance period of two years with options to extend performance on a level of effort basis.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Government.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611 with a small business size standard of $6,000.000.00.  It is anticipated that the solicitations will be issued electronically on or about 03 Dec 2003 on the Federal Business Opportunities web page at http://www.eps.gov/.  Paper copies will not be available.  Once the solicitations are posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/ amendments to any and all documents.  Offerors are therefore strongly encouraged to register for the Vendor Notification Service on FedBizOps, to be automatically alerted of any updates/changes.  A draft of each solicitation is expected to be posted by 21 Nov 03, accordingly offerors are encouraged to review the draft solicitations and advised that the Ability to Succeed (Past Performance and Financial Capacity) volume will be due on or about 05 Dec 03 with Management and Cost/Price volumes due on or about 29 Dec 03.  The Pentagon Renovation Program will host an Offeror’s Day Conference during the week of 08 Dec 03.  Offerors who submitted the Ability to Succeed volume will be invited to attend the conference.  Information regarding the Offeror’s Day Conference will be posted in FedBizOps.  Dependent upon completion of evaluations for Past Performance and Financial Capacity, an advisory down-select may be provided to offerors prior to submission of the Management and Cost/Price Volumes.  Special conditions for submission of offers and award will be included in the solicitation packages.  Any prospective contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.  Information concerning CCR registered requirements may be viewed via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling the CCR Registration Center at 1-888-227-2423.  This will be a Best Value acquisition.  The Government may select for award the offeror whose price is not necessarily the lowest, but whose technical proposal is more advantageous to the Government and warrants the additional cost.  Questions regarding the PMO and SPMO solicitations may be directed to IIRO@army.pentagon.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistic Center is seeking qualified sources that have the capability and expertise to perform the overhaul or core exchange of York International Inc air conditioning compressors and marine air conditioning condenser (condenser originally manufactured by Dunham Bush, Inc).  These items are required for the support of the 378’ WHEC and 270’ WMEC class cutters air conditioning systems.  All work or core exchange shall be performed in accordance with York International (OEM) specifications and standards, utilizing only genuine York International replacement parts.  The compressors and condenser that will be included on this intended acquisition are: (1) Stock Number 4130-01-487-5141, Compressor Part Number JE421, estimated quantity of 2 per year; (2) National Stock Number 4130-01-269-0125, Compressor Part Number SS63C, estimated quantity of 4 per year; (3) National Stock Number 4130-01-114-4487, Compressor Part Number SS62B, estimated quantity of 2 per year; and (4) National Stock Number 4130-01-492-5250, Condenser Part Number CDRM1237A2L, estimated quantity of 2 per year.  Contractor shall be required to provide all labor, materials required to open, inspect, report, repair, test, preserve, and package all compressors and condenser in accordance with current OEM specifications and standards.  The Coast Guard intends to award a firm fixed requirements contract for a base year and four option years.  Technical, engineering data and drawings to successfully overhaul or provide a core exchange of both the compressors and condenser are proprietary information, and are not available to the Government.  It is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard from obtaining full and open competition, as the technical and engineering data required to successfully perform the work is only available from one source, York International and its subsidiaries.  It is the Government’s belief that only York International and its subsidiaries possess the capabilities to repair in accordance with OEM requirements to ensure the proper form, fit and function of both the compressors and the condenser. The solicitation will be posted on FedBizOps when issued.  Contractors are encouraged to check FedBizOps on a regular basis for the solicitation. See Numbered Notes 12, 22, and 26.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.203-1 and TAM 1206.302.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-04-152, and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This procurement is being conduced under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 621511 with a small business size standard $11.5 million.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to purchase the services of a Biologist to Maintain and Generate Muscarinic Receptor Mutant Mice and Assist in their Molecular and Physiological Analysis in the Laboratory of Biooranic Chemistry from Yinghong Cui, 11171 Captains Walk CT., Gaithersburg, MD 20878.  The service will be for a Base Year with four (4) option years.   

Duties to be performed by the Biologist shall be:  

A)	Animal Husbandry:


·	Maintains multiple mutant mouse colonies housed in Bldg. 14C-North (4 racks) and Bldg. 8 (1 rack) (about 2000 mice total) 
·	Identifies all mice by ear tags 
·	Sets up matings to ensure that the different mutant mouse lines are present at sufficient numbers and ages
·	Keeps electronic records of all of Dr. Wess’ mutant mice housed in Bldg. 14C-North and Bldg. 8.  For each individual mouse, these records will show mouse sex (male or female), date of birth, genetic background, generation number, and whether or not the mouse has a specific mutation 
·	Generates mice by homozygous or heterozygous matings for experiments to be carried out in Dr. Wess’ lab or by Dr. Wess’ collaborators.  It is estimated that 1500 mice will be needed per year 
·	Uses PCR or Southern blot analysis to determine whether the mice used for experiments are wild-type or mutant mice.  Based on this analysis, mice will be classed into different experimental groups.

B)	Lab Work (to be carried out in Bldg. 8A):

·	Assists in the generation of conditional muscarinice receptor mutant mice by carrying out PCR or Southern blot analyses to identify mouse embryonic stem cells and, subsequently, mice that carry the desired mutation
·	Assists in the molecular and biochemical analysis of muscarinic receptor mutant mice by studying the expression patterns of individual muscarinic receptors.  This will require the use of RT-PCR, radioligand binding, Western blotting and immunoprecipitation techniques
·	Assists in the physiological analysis of muscarinic receptor mutant mice.  Specifically, islets will be prepared from the mouse pancreas of wild type and muscarinic receptor mutant mice.  The ability of the pancreatic islets to release insulin following different physiological stimuli (e.g. glucose, acetylcholine) will be examined.  This analysis will show which muscarinic receptor subtypes are involved in the regulation of insulin release.  

The individual shall have a Bachelor’s degree in Biology or a related science.  It is also necessary that the individual work 40 hours a week.   

NIDDK has determined that Yinghong Cui is qualified to accomplish the specific tasks, listed above, and based upon her previous experience and expertise, in the Section of Molecular Signaling, LBC.

<DESC>The Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) officially changed from an Operational Command to a Transformational Command of Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT) on 19 June 2003. HQ SACT in Norfolk, VA, is seeking Contractor support for three projects to help complete the functional realignment of the two NATO Strategic Commands, establish effective output-based management processes, and deliver Transformation to the NATO Alliance.
	In Project One, a Command Structure Implementation (CIS) Team is being established to lead, advise, and oversee the restructuring and implementation processes that will result in full operational capability for Allied Command Transformation (ACT) by 30 June 2006. Team members will work with SACT Implementation Project Teams (IPT) on: evolving task development, identifying requirements for personnel positions, and conducting reviews and audits of Transformation activities. In turn, CSI Team members will convey information on IPT actions and activities to the HQ SACT Program Management Board where resource allocations are made.
Projects Two and Three address functional management/Balanced Scorecard and Information Management/Knowledge Management (IM/KM). These projects encompass on-going work and new requirements to ensure that functional management oversight is established to keep the Transformation maturing in ways that support the Alliance. The IM/KM project will support current ACT work in:
·	Strategic concepts, doctrine, and policy development
·	Concept development and experimentation
·	Requirements and capability planning and implementation
·	Joint education and training
·	Joint and combined future capabilities research and technology
The accompanying Statement of Work describes in detail the requirements of each of the three projects, functions to be performed, deliverables to be developed, positions sought, and requirements for candidate personnel.

<DESC>The NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division is responsible for acquisition, fielding and life cycle support of Navy and Marine Corps Aviation training systems suitable for effective training.  Life cycle support includes ensuring the availability of an initial material support package at time of device fielding and the acquisition of spare and repair parts attributable to device modifications and upgrades.  These Navy and Marine Corps Aviation training systems spare and repair parts are the focus of this pre-solicitation notice.  NAVAIR Orlando TSD intends on negotiating and awarding several spare and repair parts buys on a sole source basis from 1 January 2004 through 31 December 2004.  The total estimated amount of these purchases is expected to approach $10 million.  The Navy and Marine Corps Aviation training system platforms and major subsystems to which this synopsis applies are annotated in Attachment (A).  Furthermore, the sole source original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of spare and repair parts within these subsystems are enumerated within Attachment (B).  Attachments (A) and (B) may be found at the NAVAIR Orlando Business Opportunities web site at http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/Ebusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm?client=NAWCTSD.  Once linked to the web site you must change DOCUMENT TYPES to “All”.  The attachments will be located under the heading “Navy and Marine Corps Aviation Training Systems Spare and Repair Parts”.  While this synopsis serves as a pre-solicitation notice of the sole source acquisitions for spare and repair parts from the OEMs listed in Attachment (B), it is not intended to preclude the Government from acquiring spare and repair parts through the training system design/build contractor as this strategy may serve the Government’s best interest.  See numbered note 22, which is modified as follows.  The proposed contract actions are for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only the Attachment (B) sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties not identified within Attachment (B) are encouraged to express their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  Responses to this pre-solicitation notice shall be received NLT 15 December 2003.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether respondents should be added to the Attachment (B) pool of sole source OEMs.  In those situations where the Government determines that identical parts are available from more than one OEM, it will compete these acquisitions among the OEMs.  A determination by the Government not to compete these proposed contract actions based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to negotiate and award a sole-source Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation to provide non-recurring technical engineering to complete the preliminary integration effort to transition the existing VH-60N avionics suite to a Power PC/Ethernet based avionics suite, maximizing the reusability of software developed for the SOF MH-60 configurations.  This effort will focus on integration of applicable MH-60 installation drawings and modification of MH-60 integration documentation where possible to support the installation configuration for the VH-60N.  	In addition, Contractor performance will include the integration of Cockpit Upgrade Program (CUP) unique requirements with the existing configuration, the providing of system requirements documentation, and the definition and allocation of system requirements to hardware, software, and installation subsystems.  This effort will culminate in a Preliminary Technical Review and an Engineering Change Proposal.  Sikorsky is the original equipment manufacturer, system integrator, and current depot level maintenance provider for the VH-60N, and is the only source with the requisite knowledge, proprietary data, and expertise of the VH-60N design, operation, and maintenance to meet the Navy’s requirement to integrate the VH-60N Cockpit Upgrade Program (CUP) into the VH-60N Aircraft. The estimated value of this non-recurring procurement is $6 million. The period of performance is FY04 and FY05.  This synopsis is for informational purposes only.  Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA Overview.  Within the city limits of Encinitas, California, the driller will complete approximately fifteen to twenty rotary borings with required boring depths of 30-40 feet, at sites within the West and Central Basins of San Elijo Lagoon as identified by  the Corps of Engineers geologist.  The purpose of the explorations is the collecting of samples for grain size analysis to determine beach compatibility of sediments to be excavated from a disposal pit which is to hold dredged lagoonal sediments.  No chem ical samples will be taken.  The borings will be within the intertidal mud flats; soils are anticipated to range between lean clays and coarse sands with occasional cobbles.  The upper few feet of the borings will consist of soft, water-saturated, organic- rich sandy silts.  Below this upper layer, heaving sands are likely to be encountered and will have to be accounted for in the drilling procedures.  Groundwater will be encountered throughout the entire length of the borings.

<DESC>Questions/Answers 
 Request for Quote Number 04DCL0070006
 Titled: Shipping Containers for Lab Kits

Question: 1. Is there an incumbent contractor currently performing this requirement? Is this a follow on requirement?

Answer: No and No
 
Question: 2. Do you have exact specifications besides dimensions of 8”x6”x3” and colors of White, Red and Blue for Item (1) the corrugated fold in tuck box. Specifications for Item (2) Styrofoam shipping containers?  Specifications for Item (3) corrugated shipping boxes for Styrofoam shipping containers? What about board test, paper (ie kraft or white) and flute size?
Is fold-in tuck a standard term? 

Answer:  (1) For red, white and blue 32 ECT C Flute. (2) The density of the Styrofoam is 1.25 pounds. The dimensions for the Styrofoam container are detailed in the RFP questions marks in dimensions stand for inches. (3) Styrofoam shipping container OYSTR 32 ECT C Flute. (4) The fold-in tuck box is a term to describe a box that can be assembled without using tape or other similar adhesive material.

Question 3. If the items are currently being purchased, would the cutting dies and printing plates be transferred to a new vendor or should the cost of new tooling be added to the quote? Should it be listed as a separate cost or should the tooling be included in the per piece price?

Answer: (1) The cost tooling should be added to the quote. (2) Please list it separately. 
 
Question 4. The RED, BLUE and Styrofoam containers require 24 hour turn around time. Do these three items need to arrive at their destination within twenty-four hours of order or ship within 24 hours of order? If ship within 24 hours of order, when do they need to be delivered to destination?

Answer: (1) They need to arrive at their destination within 24 hours of order.  
 
Question 5. Will the printing be reversed out on the red and blue printed boxes? Are proofs for the printing plates available?

Answer: (1) I’m not sure what “reversed out” means. The printing must be printed on the lid/top of the red, white and blue boxes. (2) No
 
Question: 6. Will all the Lab Kit Insert materials necessary to pack out the full one year requirement be shipped upfront or will partial shipments of Lab Kit Insert materials be made during the year?  If partial shipments, how many deliveries and when? If all the material will arrive upfront (enough for about 40,000 kits) how much floor space is necessary to store the Kits.  Are there special storage requirements for Lab Kit materials or finished Lab Kits?

Answer: (1) There are certain items (test tubes) that have a limited shelf life and will be shipped in partial shipments. The other items, that do not have expiration dates, can be shipped upfront sufficient for a one year requirement.

Answer: (1) Temperature controlled 50-80 degrees Fahrenheit. (2) Inside storage in a dry and secure environment. 
 
Question: 8. Are there any specific pack-out requirements not included in the Solicitation? For example, we would pack a certain number of Kits into a shipping carton. Do you have a requirement of a certain number of Kits per shipping carton or should we use our discretion when preparing for shipment? Do you want the Lab Kits shrink wrapped? Do we need to provide any kind of a void filler inside the Kit when doing the pack-out?

Answer: (1) The vendor may use their discretion in the number of kits packed into a shipping container. Please keep in mind that the Kansas City, MO location does not have a shipping dock or freight elevator. Large boxes or crates would be difficult to manage during the delivery process. (2) The kits do not need to be individually shrink wrapped. (3) No
 
Question: 9. Assuming you award the contract December 2, could the time frame for an early January startup be extended. Delivery times as specified are restrictive.

GOAL:  To develop liberal trade and investment regime and integrate Russia into world economic organizations such as the WTO. 

Agency program: SABIT Standards program

	The Standards program, run cooperatively with the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST), trains government officials who are responsible for laboratories and agencies that develop mandatory and voluntary product and measurement standards, test and certify goods, and accredit laboratories.   The SABIT Program teaches Russian regulatory officials about the U.S. conformity assessment system in order to increase their confidence in the de-centralized U.S. system thereby expanding trade between Russian and U.S. companies.  The standards program helps Russian officials better understand the international conformity assessment arena, eases their integration into the international market and enables them to better export Russian goods.

Output Measure: Approximately 20 participants from Russia will take part in the Standards programs in 2004. Many Russian alumni will also take part in follow on training in Russia throughout the year.

Near Term Performance Measure: Through interactive speaker presentations at NIST, SABIT Standards interns gain exposure to a variety of international trade and standards organizations including WTO, ILAC, ANSI, IEC, and ISO which leads to substantive dialogue and cooperation with these organizations.

Intermediate Performance Measures: U.S. testing laboratories (i.e., Underwriters Laboratories) are expanding the number of Russian testing labs with which it has both formal and informal relationships.  Russian standards and certification agencies are making progress in meeting the requirements necessary to accede to the WTO.

Russian SABIT alumni, armed with knowledge of the U.S. system of standards and certification, work to simplify and make more transparent the standardization and certification requirements in their country.

GOAL:  To promote sustainable economic growth underpinned by broad based market reform. 

Agency Program: SABIT group training and individual internship programs.

The U.S. Department of Commerce, through its SABIT program, supports Russia's economic growth by promoting market based reform at the grass roots level.  U.S. companies demonstrate how they grow their businesses and how the U.S. economy and its institutions support private industry.

Output Measure: Approximately 250 Russian managers and scientists will participate in the SABIT programs this fiscal year. Many Russian alumni will also take part in follow on training in Russia throughout the year.

Near Term Performance Measures: SABIT alumni recommend and/or implement changes to company policies including moving to internationally accredited accounting standards, writing and implementing new business and strategic plans, and making personnel and structural changes.

SABIT alumni increase the number of business partnerships and alliances formed.

Intermediate Performance Measures: SABIT alumni grow their businesses, expand into new markets, increase exports and trade.

SABIT alumni ease or assist U.S. companies with market access issues, such as customs clearance or certification problems.

SABIT alumni become involved in the development and/or reform of financial structures including banking, leasing, accounting, insurance, mortgaging, and credit mechanisms.

<DESC>Announcement: ERA Request for Proposal, NAMA-03-R-0018.  THIS IS THE PRESOLICITATION NOTICE FOR THE FINAL ELECTRONIC RECORDS ARCHIVES SYSTEM REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.
It is the intent of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to procure the ERA system and associated services.  The ERA system will authentically preserve and provide access to any kind of electronic record, free from dependency on any specific hardware or software, enabling NARA to carry out its mission into the future. To do this, ideally the system would be able to take any type of record, from any entity in the Federal Government, created using any type of application, on any computing platform, and provide discovery and delivery to anyone with an interest and legal right of access, now and for the life of the republic. 
This solicitation will be for an initial one (1) year FFP base contract period and six (6) CPAF option periods. NARA intends to initially award one or more best value contracts using a full and open competition approach as outlined in FAR 15. During the initial System Analysis and Design phase (base contract period), each of the selected contractors will produce a detailed System Requirements Specification and System Design Document. In the event that multiple contracts are awarded there will be a down select to a single contractor at the end of the base contract period. The selected contractor will perform development and deployment of the ERA on an incremental basis. The initial option period (increment 1) will be for two (2) years, and the remaining option periods (increments 2-5 and a final year of Operations and Support (O&S)) will be for one (1) year each. 
The Government may exercise optional CPAF CLINS for O&S of the system. The sixth one-year option period will be only for O&S of the system as delivered at the end of the fifth increment.
Based on industry comments several changes have been made to the RFP.  In addition, NARA will release new documents as GFI on the ERA Acquisition web site by the time the RFP is released. The ERA RFP will be released on or about December 5th, 2003 and will only be available by downloading from the ERA Acquisition web site at:
http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives/index.html
Offerors must have achieved at least SEI Software-CMM Level 3 maturity (or CMMI equivalent).
Offerors must submit proposals in accordance with RFP requirements. TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  DO NOT RESPOND TO THE FEDBIZOPS POINT OF CONTACT. 
A Bidders’ Conference will be held shortly after the release of the RFP.  Only Offerors who have submitted an Intention to Bid letter in accordance with the instructions in the RFP will be invited and informed of the date, time and place of this conference.
This RFP shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Any information provided to the Government is strictly voluntary and at no cost to the Government. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred by interested parties for responses to this RFP. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFP and the Government’s use of such information.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to address Questions and Answers in response to Solicitation Number USSS040008. Question: 1)The original synopsis/socilitation states the need for six (6) three-day classes in the Base Period. After modifying the solicitation, are these numbers still accurate (six sessions, three days each)?  Since the course content is different than originally stated and because the original solicitation asked for twenty-four (24) students per class (now eight), it would seem that these numbers might be different. Answer: Yes, the classes will be for 3 days, 6 sessions per year.  Question: 2) Will the first session still be scheduled for December 9-11, 2003, as originally stated in the Solicitation? Answer: Yes, the first session is scheduled for December 9-11, 2003.

Power Cable, Model #9937-6000, to include (1) Serrodyne Doppler Generator, Model #2003-5003, (2) Packet Radio RF Data Link System, Model #2003-8003, (3) 62 Hour Continuous Emergency Solar Power System, Model # 2003-8003.  Repair and modify 1 each Radar Calibration Target, Model #9937-0100 to include a Serrodyne Doppler Generator, Model #2003-5003.  In addition this unit will contain a Packet Radio RF Data Link System, Model 2003-8003 and a modified Power Supply, Model #9937-6000, to be interchangeable with the above “A” system.  Repair and modify two (2) each Addendums for the existing Operations and Maintenance Manuals, IM-100.   CONTRACTOR MUST SUPPLY AT LEAST 1 PREVIOUS PROJECT DETAILING THE MANUFACTURING OF THE SYSTEM.  A SOLICITATION WILL NOT ISSUED as a result of this CBD.  Only one order will be issued for this requirement, no partials.  PURPOSE: This project is intended to supply a new turnkey system compatible with the two existing systems provided by Fredwal, Inc. at the Pacific Missile Range Facility. IMPACT: The additional system will work in conjunction with the current (2) two systems to provide a quality radar system for the client. Only specified makes and models of technical equipment and parts will satisfy the agency’s needs for additional units or replacement items, and only one source is available (i.e., Incompatibility of hardware/software, to avoid the added cost of training employees to operate systems using a variety of different types of hardware and software).  JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:   Fredwal, Inc. is the only known vendor of this item.  PMRF needs to maintain commonality with the existing Fredwal Phase Coherent Radar Calibration target already in use.  If that existing target suffers a casualty, this new target would be used as a backup for mission calibrations and must maintain commonality for performance stability, spare parts, service and maintenance.

AVIATION SAFETY REPORTING SYSTEM (ASRS) SUMMARY DESCRIPTION  NAICS Code: 51821  /	Size Standard: $21M PURPOSE:  NASA ARC seeks industry comments and input on its summary description of the work statement for ASRS, as well as information on potential sources for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for this requirement. BACKGROUND NASA, by agreement with the Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has operated and managed the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) program since 1976.  The ASRS reporting model has become one of the primary tools recognized as a necessary complement to other safety efforts. NASA has operated and managed the Aviation Safety Program (AvSP) since 1999.  AvSP deals with the operations systems and research concerning aviation safety data.  The ASRS and AvSP requirements are currently combined in NASA contract, NAS2-99091, the Aviation Operations Measuring Systems (AOMS)  Contract NAS2-99091, valued at approximately $44M, is currently being performed by Battelle Memorial Institute and will expire on November 8 2004.	To promote competition, the recompete effort for the AOMS will split the requirement into two procurements.  This sources sought notice is for the ASRS requirement. The mission of the ASRS is to acquire information concerning current and potential safety concerns in the operational performance of the National Aviation System, and to assist in the effective use of that information in the furtherance of aviation safety and system improvements.  The ASRS  deals with the maintenance and operation of a voluntary, confidential incident reporting program that, by agreement with the FAA, complements the FAA’s Aviation Safety Reporting Program (ASRP).   A separate sources will be posted for the AvSP requirement, which will now be addressed as Safety Vulnerability Analysis and Strategic Management (SVASM).  The point of contact for the SVASM requirement is Natalie LeMar, Contract Specialist at Natalie.R.LeMar@nasa.gov.  The Contracting Officer is Jill Willard. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS A five (5) year contract period of performance is planned, consisting of a two-year base period and 3 one-year options. The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, tools, equipment, facilities, supervision, and management necessary to perform the requirements of this contract.	The contractor shall operate the ASRS and the new applications of the model in medicine, security, and other potential environments to be determined. As part of any capabilities package submitted to this sources-sought synopsis, potential offerors must demonstrate an understanding of the requirements to operate complex, confidential reporting systems; maintain security protections over data; and manage large databases.  Additionally, demonstrated expertise in safety management, information technology development, web-based applications, and access to subject-matter experts to work as safety analysts in the areas of aviation, medicine and security is required.  Demonstrated knowledge of aviation, medicine, and security is required.	OPERATION OF THE ASRS The ASRS currently receives approximately 35,000 reports/year from aviation professionals such as pilots, air traffic controllers, flight attendants, mechanics, and other front-line professionals.	These reports are processed through a well-defined path of procedures and requirements to assure confidentiality of the person reporting and any third-party references.  Aviation analysts must screen each report within 3-5 working days.  In this initial and final screening process, the analysts must decide the disposition of each report according to NASA-established categories, including alert messages for any report describing significant aviation hazards and/or having accident prevention potential.  Typically, 200-300 of these alert messages are distributed/year. Following screening, all submitted reports are further evaluated for potential multiple report matching.  The contractor shall verify the matching of separate reports describing the same event and retain these reports as one record to the database.  Typically, 20% of the incident reports received can be matched (e.g., a Captain report with a First Officer report on the same incident).  In some cases, several reports will be received on the same incident from flight crew, cabin crew, maintenance, and air traffic control. One of the categories established by NASA is Full-Form Records.  These are incident report records that are input into the ASRS database following extensive evaluation by the aviation analysts.  The ratio of Full-Form records processed to the database and those received at the ASRS will vary due to funding constraints.  Currently, 20% of all reports received as fully processed to the ASRS database.  The Government considers the achievement of entering 40% of the reports received into the ASRS database as highly desirable.  All reports are de-identified and no identifying information is retained after the reporter’s ID strip is returned, which is a legal requirement of the program. The contractor shall provide the capability necessary for the uninterrupted, secure operation of a data storage and database system.  The ASRS database utilizes Oracle technology.  The minimum expected capability requirement should provide for the data input, data storage, and rapid retrieval of the processed data.  The system must be capable of providing an interactive, analytical method for the performance of routine and special searched of the processed incident data. The contractor shall maintain the ASRS Home Page (  http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov  ) and update this periodically with new information, as it becomes available.  The ASRS products accessed here, as well as distributed through the mail, include the ASRS monthly publication (CALLBACK), data report sets, program information, program educational materials, safety studies and message capability. The contractor shall prepare research and operational reports of several types in response to requests from NASA, FAA, NTSB, and other users of the ASRS.  These may include scientific and technical reports on aviation human factors and other safety related work.  The contractor shall respond to requests for database information, routine analyses, and special studies, which must be provided according to timelines and under cost controls established by NASA. EXTENSIONS OF THE ASRS MODEL Understanding of the aviation model of confidential reporting is required for its application and replication to two new environments, medicine and security.  NASA, by agreement with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and their National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS), began the operation and management of the Patient Safety Reporting System (PSRS) program in May 2000.  The PSRS replicates the successful criteria of the ASRS in the environment of health care delivery in the VA system of hospitals, clinics, and outpatient services.  The contractor is required to maintain the same provisions concerning this system of reporting medical safety events as the aviation system. This follow on effort has a growth potential to include the development of a prototype Security Incident Reporting System (SIRS) modeled after the ASRS. Based on this draft SOW, NASA is looking for the following capabilities: -Operate complex, confidential reporting systems -Maintain security protections over data -Manage large databases -Expertise in safety management -Expertise in information technology development and web-based applications -Access to subject-matter experts to work as safety analysts in the areas of aviation, medicine, and security -Demonstrated knowledge of aviation, medicine, and security -Utilizes oracle technology to input, store, and rapidly retrieve processed data  -Provide an interactive, analytical method for the performance of routine and special searches of processed incident data. -Prepare research and operational reports (may include scientific and technical reports on aviation human factors and other safety related work) -Respond to requests for database information -Respond to requests for routine and special analyses Interested offerors having the required specialized capabilities to meet or exceed the above requirement are asked to submit written comments, questions and a capability statement of 10 pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein to Gail Woll via electronic transmission at Gail.V.Woll@nasa.gov or by facimile transmission to (650)604-3020, no later than 4:30 p.m. local time, December 19, 2003.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to acquire mainframe hardware, required to meet the SSA’s capacity needs, from IBM Corporation.  The SSA will pursue acquiring Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon (CMOS) processors with sufficient processing capacity to support the processing needs of the Agency. The maximum quantity needed will increase from six to ten machines with an additional ten machines reserved for Disaster Recovery Requirements.   Additionally, the processors must be capable of operating in 64-bit mode, capable of running IBM z/OS 1.4 and future IBM z/OS operating systems.  The processor must support z/Architecture, as the Agency’s operating system is z/OS and run in 64-bit real support mode.  Running z/OS in 64-bit mode, which is only possible on a z/Architecture processor, is essential to SSA’s VSAM and DB2 application growth and performance.  Processors must include Input/Output channels which support IBM FICON (native/FICON bridge card support), ESCON (native/converted/CTC), Open System Adaptors (Gigabit OSA) and Coupling Facility Links (single mode).  Processors must provide Sysplex Timer connectivity and participate in a Parallel Sysplex environment.  IBM Corporation is the only source known with a product capable of meeting these requirements.  Any firm that feels they have the capability of providing an equivalent product must respond, in writing, within 10 days of this notice.  Responses must be specific as to the alternate product proposed and must include detailed specifications to support claims of equivalency to the IBM processors.  Acknowledgement of responses received will not be provided.  If no acceptable responses are received, SSA shall issue a delivery order against IBM's GSA schedule contract.

<DESC>NA This posting is an update to the Sources Sought Notice published 14 January 2003 in the FedBizOpps for the At-Platform Automatic Test Systems (APATS) which has been renamed the Maintenance Support Device-Version 2 (MSD-V2) System and is now listed under So licitation No.W15P7T-04-R-A801.   The purpose of this market survey is to find commercially available products that potentially meet the requirement for the MSD-V2 System and to identify for the Army potential sources’ interest in this procurement as eithe r the prime contractor or a subcontractor.  The MSD-V2 System of the Integrated Family of Test Equipment (IFTE) is the Army’s fourth generation multipurpose standard automatic test equipment.  This tester is a continuation of the first (Contact Test Set (C TS)), second (Soldier’s Portable On-System Repair Tool (SPORT)) and third (Maintenance Support Device (MSD)) generation programs and will capture state-of-the-art technological advances in capability, performance, ergonomics, compactness, etc.  It will be used throughout the Department of Defense (DoD) at all levels of maintenance to test and diagnose Army’s highly complex communications, other electronic commodity equipment, missiles, aircraft and ground vehicles to identify failed line replaceable units ( LRUs).  The DoD maintainers will also use the MSD-V2 system to host Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals and/or specific application software and to upload/download mission data or software.  It will also be used to replace at-system testers which have  become mission incapable.  The MSD-V2 System will be comprised of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software and hardware together with system specific interconnecting cables.  The heart of the system is a computer capable of performing specified tests on d ifferent weapon systems through the systems’ IETMs and adding or changing PCMCIA cards with appropriate connecting test cables and interconnecting boxes.  The MSD-V2 Kit with the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Test Adapter Kit test capability replaces bo th the Contact Test Set (CTS) with ICE and Simplified Test Equipment-ICE (STE-ICE).  The MSD-V2 Kit with the ICE Test Adapter Kit shall be ruggedized to withstand the physical environment and shall be able to survive in the tactical environment of the sold ier technician.    The draft Specification and Statement of Objectives can be found on the Army’s Interactive Business Opportunities Page under Solicitation No. W15P7T-04-R-A801.

<CONTACT>Susan Benik Contract Specialist 7037871350     Susan.Benik@mms.gov;
<DESC>NA DESCRIPTION: The Department of Interior (DOI)/GovWorks, on behalf of the Bureau for Global Health, is seeking a potential contractor to undertake program and administrative support through the provision of personnel, office space, equipment, tools, materials, supervision and other items and services.   BACKGROUND:   The Bureau for Global Health (GH) is the Agency's center of excellence and focal point in providing worldwide leadership and technical expertise in the areas of child and maternal health and nutrition, HIV/AIDS, infectious disease, population, family planning and related reproductive health services.  As such, the Bureau aligns Agency resources with identified public health and development needs, and influences the global health priorities of the U.S. private sector, U.S.-based foundations, other donor organizations, host country governments, and host country civil society organizations. The Bureau is the Agency repository for state-of-the-art thinking in biomedical, social science, and operations research and works to produce technical advances and innovations that can be disseminated and replicated at USAID missions throughout the world. The Bureau provides program mechanisms (such as cooperative agreements, contracts, and indefinite quantity contracts) and technical expertise to carry out the Agency's global health goals in support of 70 plus field Missions around the world.  The Global Health Bureau has an approved staff level of 222 positions and is composed of seven offices. The contractor will be expected to carry out program and administrative support to the Bureau for Global Health through the provision of personnel, office space, equipment, tools, materials, supervision and other items and services necessary to manage and perform the required tasks. The contract will also be structured to accommodate buy-ins from other USAID/Washington bureaus for support services.   SCOPE OF WORK:  This procurement is an 8(A) set-aside issued under NAICS Code 561110 - Office Administrative Services.  The estimated personnel to carry out this contract for Global Health include nine management/core staff, 20 administrative assistants, 28 program assistants, and four regional assistants.  In addition, the contract will have an option to accommodate other Bureau buy-ins to obtain the services of up to eight administrative assistants to provide support services.  The contract will also include sufficient flexibility for up to 10 additional staff to cover future requirements should GH Bureau programs experience an unanticipated increase in funding and/or activity that may create a need for additional administrative and/or program assistants.  The contract will also fund space, equipment, supplies and other needs consistent with the personnel LOE. While all staff will need security clearances to enter the GH Bureau offices, space and security restrictions allow for only 10 staff to work full-time on-site in GH Bureau offices.  Other staff will need to be housed off-site within two blocks of the GH Bureau offices for easy access and availability to carry out required assignments.   The period of performance of the resultant contract will be one year with four (4) one year options. The Government anticipates a time and materials contract. IN ORDER TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT, Offerors must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, not later than 2:00PM, December 03, 2003, a Capabilities Statement describing in detail:  (1) your key personnel and program manager (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the work) with their qualifications in regards to the scope of work (2) your organizational experience regarding similar projects and magnitude; and (3) specific references (including contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with point of contact & telephone number) for previous related work performed within the last two years.  If you believe the Government may find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your organization to address the problem. After review of all Capabilities Statements, those offerors deemed "Best Qualified" will be provided additional proposal instructions and contract requirements.  GovWorks intends to notify offerors approximately 5 days after receipt of capability statements, of whether or not you are considered "Best Qualified."  Each offeror's capabilities Statement will be evaluated based on the following:  Factors A and B which are in descending order of importance.  Sub-factors listed under each factor are of equal importance to each other. A) KEY PERSONNEL--key persons' skills, abilities and experience within the areas of health communication; Internet health information; Internet evaluation methodologies; and effective communication with diverse audiences; B) ORGANAZATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND PAST PERFORMANCE -- your organization's experience and past performance (including number, size, and complexity of similar projects, technical excellence, adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of program management, willingness to cooperate when difficulties arise, willingness to partner with the Government in providing robust solutions, general compliance with the terms of the contracts, and acceptability of delivered product and service rendered).   Offerors shall submit their capability statements in original and eight (8) copies to Susan Benik, Contracting Officer, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2500, Herndon Virginia 20170-4817.  In addition, offerors shall include one electronic copy on CD-ROM.  Time of receipt of submissions will be determined by the time received in the Procurement Operations Branch, Herndon, Virginia.  Questions should be faxed to Susan Benik at (703) 787-1350 or e-mailed to Susan.Benik@mms.gov.  Questions should be provided no later than November 25, 2003.  All correspondence should include this RFP number (32788), full name/company name, address and phone and fax numbers.  Requests or questions by telephone are strongly discouraged.    If you are interested in this acquisition, you may locate the  statement of work documents on the following website:  http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp, and identified as: 1435-04-04-AN 32788.

A NEW 2000 AMP DISTRIBUTION SECTION AND HOUSEKEEPING PAD WILL BE REQUIRED, ALONG WITH A NEW 1000 AMP CIRCUIT BREAKER, CONDUIT, WIRE, HARDWARE, AND LABOR TO PROVIDE THE INCREASED CAPACITY.

4. IN PARTICULAR, THE CONTRACTOR WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FOLLOWING:
A.	POUR A NEW HOUSEKEEPING PAD
B.	INSTALL A NEW DISTRIBUTION SECTION
