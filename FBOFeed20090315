<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAVAIRWARCENACDIV) Lakehurst intends to procure, via full and open competition, a replacement system for the existing AN/USM-636(V) Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) with a next generation test system solution, herein referred to as electronic Consolidated Automated Support System (eCASS).

General Description:  CASS is a common family of Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) for automated avionics/electronics testing at Navy Intermediate Level maintenance and Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) sites both shore-based and afloat.  Legacy mainframe CASS systems are approaching the end of their useful service life and will be replaced with eCASS.  With the replacement of legacy mainframe CASS, reutilization of approximately 750 existing CASS Test Program Sets (TPSs) is required on eCASS while maintaining or improving fidelity of test, run-times and performance.  The Offeror will be responsible for any TPS software processes and related tools required for CASS TPS migration to eCASS.  The new test station shall have a compatibility mode that will emulate existing CASS station characteristics in order to maintain legacy CASS TPS performance and will also have an eCASS mode that permits taking advantage of the full range of advanced eCASS station capabilities.  The program will include delivery of eCASS TPS development suites, which includes a CASS to eCASS TPS conversion toolset, and an eCASS to RTCASS TPS conversion toolset.

eCASS will be procured as one core system, known as an eCASS Core System, and five different eCASS Mission Equipment Kits (MEK).  The eCASS Core System and different combinations of eCASS MEKs allow eCASS to perform the five legacy CASS missions (legacy CASS Configurations) and a new eCASS Depot mission.  The six missions, along with the equipment to perform the missions are as follows:
1.	Hybrid Mission - An eCASS Core System alone will perform the legacy CASS Hybrid Mission.
2.	Radio Frequency Mission - An eCASS Core System with an eCASS Radio Frequency MEK (RF-MEK) performs the legacy CASS Radio Frequency Mission.  This combination of eCASS equipment can be commonly referred to as an eCASS RF System.
3.	Communication, Navigation, and Identification Mission - An eCASS Core System with an eCASS RF-MEK, an eCASS Communication, Navigation, and Identification Mission Equipment Kit (CNI-MEK), and the GFE CASS Communications, Navigation, and Identification Ancillary Set (CNIAS) performs the legacy CASS CNI Mission.  This combination of eCASS and CASS equipment can be commonly referred to as an eCASS CNI System.
4.	High Power Mission  An eCASS Core System with an eCASS RF-MEK, an eCASS High Power Mission Equipment Kit (HP-MEK), and the GFE CASS HPDTS performs the legacy CASS High Power Mission.  This combination of eCASS and CASS equipment can be commonly referred to as an eCASS HP System.
5.	Depot Mission - An eCASS Core System with an eCASS RF-MEK and an eCASS Depot Mission Equipment Kit (DEPOT-MEK) performs the new eCASS Depot Mission.  This combination of eCASS equipment can be commonly referred to as an eCASS Depot System.
6.	Electro-Optics Mission - An eCASS Core System with an eCASS Electro-Optics MEK (EO-MEK) and the GFE CASS EO Console performs the legacy CASS Electro-Optics Mission.  This combination of eCASS and CASS equipment can be commonly referred to as an eCASS EO System.

eCASS shall be designed for shipboard and shore-based use, and shall be compliant with the eCASS specification and all other applicable documentation.  Some eCASS documentation is only accessible via the eCASS Technical Library.  Instructions to Prime Offerors and subcontractors for obtaining access to the eCASS Technical Library will be included in the RFP at Section L, Paragraph 7.0.  All Offerors interested in obtaining this data should be prepared to submit a certified copy of a DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement.  To obtain certification, contact Defense Logistics Information Service at (800) 352-3572 or http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/documents.asp.  

The contract type is anticipated to be Cost-Plus Incentive Fee for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) portion with Fixed Price Incentive options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) I and LRIP II deliveries.  The anticipated quantities for the basic contract will include the efforts to design, test and produce fourteen (14) Engineering Development Models (EDMs) to support Design Testing.  Also required are EDM RF-MEK, CNI-MEK, HP-MEK, DEPOT-MEK, EO-MEK, SMAT/CAL OTPS Kits; Calibration Equipment Kits; TPS Development Suites; CASS Qualification Test OTPS; technical and logistical data; training; and up to 20,000 hours of annual engineering and logistics services to support eCASS.  The contract will contain LRIP options to procure up to twenty (20) LRIP I eCASS RF Systems in FY13 and up to twenty (20) LRIP II eCASS RF Systems in FY14, along with additional items to support the LRIP eCASS systems.

This procurement will be full and open.  The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.  Select Doing Business and then Open Solicitations.  Look for amendments on the web page.  Hard copy of solicitations and amendments will NOT be mailed to contractors.  The solicitation will be posted on the web, on or about 30 March 2009.  The Government will NOT accept electronic offers.  Any questions about the RFP should be in writing and sent either by email to marybeth.kacek@navy.mil or via letter to the following address: Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Contracts Code 2.5.2.1.4MK, Attn: Marybeth Kacek, Highway 547, Building 562-3C, Lakehurst, NJ 08733.

amaxa, inc. is the sole company which develops and commercializes the Nucleofector Technology, and to date the Nucleofector Technology is not available from any distributor or dealer within the United States.

The Nucleofector concept uses a unique combination of electrical parameters and cell-type specific Nucleofector solutions. Based on this combination, the Nucleofector Technology is the first efficient routine method for non-viral gene transfer into primary cells and hard-to-transfect cell lines. In addition, the Nucleofector Technology to date is unique in its ability to transfer DNA directly into the cell nucleus. The Nucleofector technology thus enables gene transfer into highly relevant cell types, often with unprecedented efficiencies.
