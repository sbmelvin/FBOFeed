<CONTACT>Susan Benik Contract Specialist 7037871350     Susan.Benik@mms.gov;
<DESC>The following questions and answers are being released for this RFQ: NOTE:  If offers are providing more than one proposal (i.e. proposals for multiple regions), please clearly indicate on the cover of the proposal, which region the proposal is for. The following Bidder?s Questions and Answers are hereby provided: 1. Are any of the multiple award contracts specifically set aside for small businesses? The program does not have any portion specifically set aside for small businesses. 2.  What is the current staff size? Staff Matrix? The program discussed in the RFP is the only scholarship program under the Africa Education Initiative. There is no staff matrix to share on the scholarship program. 3.   What percentage of the staff are US based, US expatriates, and local staff beyond the Country Cluster Coordinator in each country? We look to offerors to present the best skills mix to implement the scholarship program.  In addition, as this is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract, specific information will be called out in each task order. 4.   Does the $8M include scholarship funds as well as contractor administrative & staffing costs? Yes.   5.   What percentage of the contract value is allocated to the following areas: -Primary, Secondary, and University Scholarships -Girls Mentoring Activities -Educational Support Activities -NGO Capacity Building The activity is to provide scholarships at the primary and secondary levels. Mentoring activities and educational support activities are a part of the scholarship program designed to provide extensive support for recipients in helping them achieve success. NGO capacity building is a part of the implementation of the activity and, through involvement; we look to local partners to be stronger in administering programs The total contract value has not been broken down into the above areas.  As this is an ID/IQ Contract, each task order will contain specific information. 6.  What are the current strategic growth goals of the GSP to expand into other countries within the 3 existing regions, beyond current 3 regions? It is anticipated that the scholarship program will remain in the three regions of sub-Saharan Africa. 7.  Are the facilities located in Abidjan, Addis-Ababa, Bamako, Dakar, and Nairobi, available for future contractor staff or do they belong to the incumbent?are they located inside Embassies or USAID facilities?  We have no such facilities.  8.  Are these facilities required locations for Country Coordinators, or are the locations flexible? There are no required locations for Country Coordinators. 9.   What are the strategic goals to promote community-buy in?is this the goal of the NGO capacity building?  Our goals are:  to promote basic education to local children, support community drop-in and learning centers; and enlist the community to sustain the momentum of basic education reforms. 10.  Can we have a copy of the AFR/SD/Education 2003 goals? AFR/SD will remain focused on access to and retention of girls in school to increase the numbers of girls completing their education. Mentoring programs will provide a basis of support for scholarship recipients.  USAID  11.  Is the management of the program designed to be top-down from US Management staff or from the bottom-up from local staff?  Offerors are encouraged to present what they feel is best.  In addition, each task order will contain specific information. 12.  Do the NGOs unilaterally evaluate and select recipients? No. USAID expects there to be cooperation among various entities at each site. 13.  Who will review the proposals? Will local staff be included in review and award decisions? Development professionals who have expertise in Africa and education will review technical proposals. 14.  Do all the countries, or regional offices use a standardized application, evaluation, and tracking system? There is no standardization within or among countries, and none on a regional basis. 15.  Is there any of the work that will be performed to fulfill the RFP requirements allowed to be accomplished in the Continental United States?  If yes, how much? It is up to the offeror to determine the best way to implement the scholarship program.  In addition, each task order will have specifics for the task order?s scope of work. 16.  It is assumed that travel will be required to each of the 35 countries mentioned in the RFP.  However, we could not locate any instructions relative to travel being performed in accordance with Joint Travel Regulations or any other specific instructions. Are we to assume that travel will be reimbursed as other direct costs? Request clarification. Travel will be proposed on each task order.  For purposes of a cost proposal, please indicate if there are any additional add-ons to travel. 17.  Has there been any consideration to extending the due date of the proposals beyond the current due date of January 6, 2003 (assuming that January 6, 2002 stated in the solicitation is a typographical error)?  The reason for asking this question is that the time lapse between 17 December 2002 and 6 January 2003 is 12 working days, including  the posted date and the due date, for a contract worth approximately $20,000,000.00. Consideration has been given to extending the deadline, but it has been determined that the deadline of January 6, 2003 will be maintained. 18.       What does the acronym NGO mean or represent? The acronym "NGO" stands for non-government organization. 19. Since the solicitation suggests that multiple contracts will be awarded for activities in east, west, and southern Africa, can you tell us what percentage of the total project amount will be allocated to each region?  Additionally, since multiple contracts will be awarded, it is necessary to organize our cost proposal by region?  Alternatively, if we are interesting in a particular geographic area, can we dedicate our technical and cost proposals to a particular region as opposed to all three areas? Offerors are requested to state the region for which they are submitting a proposal: east, west, or southern. The $8 million now available will be split approximately $2.6 million per region (i.e. thirds).   20.  The solicitation clearly states the requirements for the technical proposal include 1) key staff, 2) organizational experience and facilities, and 3) past performance.  However, the evaluation criteria clearly list both technical approach and innovative solutions as evaluation criteria.  Should our technical proposal also include a description of our approach for implementing project activities throughout Africa? Offerors are encouraged to present their proposed program as thoroughly as possible and in ways in which they believe best communicate their capabilities and plan. 21.  When are project activities awarded under this solicitation scheduled to begin? Activities under the awarded contract will begin as quickly as possible. We do not know whether we will need to have a round of best and final offers. We hope for the contract to begin between January 15-22, 2003. 22.       RESERVED ? No Question/Answer. 23.  We also have a question related to the different regions for which contracts will be awarded.  If we choose to apply to more than one region, must we submit separate proposals?   Yes, but the proposal must be CLEARLY MARKED for the specific region for which you are proposing. 24.  Are you anticipating firm fixed price fully burdened labor hours with cost reimbursable ODCs task orders?  In other words a pricing structure which would anticipate a time and materials arrangement with FFP labor hours?  Other than indirect costs and fringe do you anticipate any other costs being included in the fully burdened labor hour rate [for instance costs of corporate backstopping, secretarial support, computer rentals]? Offerors should respond with the fully burdened labor rates to include all burdens associated with this project.  25.  Although criteria for evaluation are presented, i.e. Technical approach, innovative solutions, presentation, etc ? are there specific evaluation subfactors under these criteria which would be helpful to us in determining what you are looking for under each of these factors?   No, specific subfactors have not been defined. 26.  Is there an incumbent contractor and, if so, who is it?   Winrock International implemented the Ambassador Girls' Scholarship Program under the Education for Development and Democracy Initiative. The program advertised herein is under the Africa Education Initiative, and is different from the previous program. There is not an incumbent contractor under the Africa Education Initiative. 27.  Could you please clarify which countries fall in which region?  For example, what region do Congo, Gabon, and the DRCongo fall into? EAST:  Madagascar, Rwanda, Kenya, Mauritius, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Burundi, southern Sudan (11 countries). WEST:  Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Cote d?Ivoire, Liberia, Burkina Faso, Benin, Sao Tome & Principe, Ghana, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Togo Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic (22 countries). SOUTHERN:  Angola, Zambia, Mozambique, Botswana, Namibia, Republic of South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland (8 countries). More Sub-Saharan countries may be added to the program. 28. Is the $8,000,000/year for the management and technical assistance for the scholarship program, or does it include the scholarship money as well? The funding is all-inclusive. 29.  It states that the proposal is due by 3:00pm January 6, 2002.  We assume it is supposed to read 2003.  Please clarify. Your assumption is correct. 30.  The solicitation states that the technical proposal should not exceed 20 pages, including resumes.  Does that mean only key personnel's resumes should be included?   Yes. 31.  Is there a current scholarship tracking system, or will the contractor be required to design, install, and maintain one?  Will there be required coordination between regional database tracking systems (will all three regional tracking systems have to be linked)? For the sake of continuity, all tracking systems will be linked. 32.  If the total estimated value for all three regions is $8M over two years, then how does the funding break down by each region?? The initial funding is approximately $2.6 million per region.  33.  Are the funds within solicitation strictly for administration of the project or are they the pot from which the scholarships will be funded??? The $8 million includes both the scholarship program and its administration. 34.  Are State Department/USAID country Missions supposed to provide matching funds or other types of funds to supplement the scholarship program? There will not be supplemental funding for the scholarship program. 35.  Within the EDDI initiative, who were the implementers of the AGSP activity, particularly in the West African countries? Within the EDDI initiative, who were the implementers of the AGSP activity, particularly in the West African countries? An illustrative listing of implementers included Forum for African Women Educationalists; Caritas; Porto Novo Deaf School; Bahai; Association pour la Protection de l?Enfance Malheureuse (APEM); Botswana Christian AIDS Intervention Program; Congo-US Alumni Association; ASAPSU; Congo-American Language Institute; CONAFED; Christina Missionary Alliance; Protestant Confederation; Catholic Confederation of Convention Schools; Kimbanguists and Moslem Federations; Mennonite Community; American Missionary Schools; Catholic Relief Services; Lycee Sacre Coeur; KEPAWE; JJ Roberts Foundation; Restore Another Child?s Hope (REACH); TUCSIN; Institute of Bankers in Southern Africa; Caritas- Orphanaid; Tanzanian Association of Women Leaders in Agriculture and the Environment (TAWLAE); IIEEG; World Vision. 36.       Is there a requirement for small business? No. 37.   RESERVED ? No Question/Answer. 38.       The RFP states that GovWorks "...intends to competitively award multiple contracts (one each for east, west and southern Africa)."  Are bidders allowed to propose 1 or 2 of the regions as areas of focus or should each bidder submit proposals that include all 3 regions? Bidders may submit proposals for one, two, or three regions.  All proposals must be clearly marked for the region they are proposed for. 39.       RESERVED ? No Question/Answer. 40.   For the fixed labor categories, does the funder wish labor categories by Senior, Mid-Level and/or Junior Level?  If so, do they have prescribed criteria for each of these levels? Offerors should propose all labor categories that are appropriate to the project.  In addition, offerors should clearly define the proposed labor categories. 41.  While offerors will attempt to think of the maximum number of fixed labor categories possible for this contract, will new categories be allowed to be add new labor categories depending on the country/task? Offerors should propose all labor categories for the life of the project.   42.       We are aware that numerous scholarships programs have been carried out in numerous African countries.  Will this new effort expect us to build on existing programs in the same countries or will new countries and new programs be chosen? The scholarship program under the Africa Education Initiative will build on the program from the Education for Development and Democracy Initiative. 43. The solicitation does not detail the requirements for the cost proposal.  Are funders only required to submit a rate schedule outlining their proposed labor categories and rates for each of the five years of the program (2 base years and three potential one year options?)  If more is to be included, could a checklist of the additional items be provided? A cost proposal shall also be submitted.  As this will be an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (ID/IQ), offerors shall submit fully burdened labor rates and proposed labor categories for this effort.  In addition, offerors should indicate any indirect costs that will be applied to issuing scholarships, travel, etc. 44. Is there a baseline budget that we may get to determine specific of our overall budget?  For example, the costs of scholarships and the ancillary expenses associated to the awards should be apart of a complete budget.  We?d like to get a copy of any previous GSP response (s) ? to get a more realistic perspective of the line items to include. USAID will not be releasing this information. 45.  Is there a website or an organization that has administered this program that we may reference?  We are presently involved in several in-country projects, have an on-going commitment there and understand the basics of initiating and administering programs but would like to get a better handle on any specifics (best practices; lessons learned, etc.) of the GSP that we should be aware of. The website for the Education for Development and Democracy Initiative is www.eddionline.org. 46.  What is the award schedule?  Due date:  Jan 6, 2003.  What are the next steps?  When is the award announcement expected? The award date is anticipated for on or about January 15, 2003. 47.  How many scholarships are expected in each region?  What is the approximate  average scholarship amount?  We expect at least 52,000 scholarships to be awarded per year across all regions. The cost of scholarships varies by country, level, and type of school.  48.  Which countries are included in each region?  EAST:  Madagascar, Rwanda, Kenya, Mauritius, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Burundi, southern Sudan (11 countries). WEST:  Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Cote d?Ivoire, Liberia, Burkina Faso, Benin, Sao Tome & Principe, Ghana, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Togo Cameroon, Gabon, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic (22 countries). SOUTHERN:  Angola, Zambia, Mozambique, Botswana, Namibia, Republic of South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland (8 countries). More Sub-Saharan countries may be added to the program 49.       If one contractor bids all three regions will the single proposal have a sixty page limit?  No  Offerors can propose for each region, however the proposals must be separate and be clearly marked. 50.              How will ordering be accomplished?  May it be assumed that for each task the contractor will propose a price and management approach?  The Government intention is for offerors to propos a management and price approach based on the rates provided in the RFQ. 51.       When is performance expected to begin?  Performance is anticipated to begin on or about January 15-22, 2003. 52.  It is our understanding that the offeror will propose labor categories and rates for its administrative/management efforts, plus an indirect rate that will be applied to scholarships, travel and other costs for subcontractors and NGOs.  Is this correct? This is an acceptable approach. 53.       Is the price estimate provided in the solicitation a total for all three regions?  Yes.

<DESC>The Virginia Contracting Activity, on behalf of the Defense Intelligence Agency/Missile and Space Intelligence Center (DIA/MSIC), intends to enter into a contract with Summerfield Atlantic Research Limited.  The objective of this Dynamic Test Data Integration effort is to develop an integrated final report detailing analysis and results of data collected and analyzed during the SIT-II dynamic test series.  This effort will entail coordination with various elements of the US and UK government teams supporting TOP SECRET Special Access Programs (SAPs).  The information to be integrated derives from two separate but directly related SAPs.   The integrated final report will include data and analyses from multiple US and UK government and contractor organizations directly involved in SIT-II and the predecessor programs.  Summerfield Atlantic Research is uniquely qualified to develop this final report based on previous efforts perfomed by  it's employees and participation in the SAPs.  The highly classified nature of the activities within the SAPs and the limited number of personnel from both nations actually involved in the technical efforts resulted in specialization and limited-to-no overlap in function while executing the programs.  A survey of all other sources associated with the SAPs was conducted by MSIC and Summerfield Atlantic Research Limited was the only company that has access to the information necessary to produce the required final report.  Services are to be performed in MSIC facilities, Redstone Arsenal, AL and personnel assigned to this facility must have a TOP SECRET/SCI clearance. The contract will have a period of performance of 12 months from date of award. No request for proposals shall be issued other than this notice.  All offerors interested in submitting a proposal must fax their proposals with details to MSIC, Donna Tignor, FAX 256-313-7963 or email proposals to Donna Tignor at tigor@msic.dia.mil. not later than 1200 noon Central Daylight Savings Time January 15, 2003.

<RESPDATE>012203
<ARCHDATE>12312003
<CONTACT>Wallace O. Adcox Contract Specialist 7037871362     Wallace.Adcox@mms.gov;
<DESC>Gov.Works is issuing this request for proposals on behalf of the Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS), an Agency within U.S. Department of Agriculture. PLEASE READ THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. 1. BACKGROUND: The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (Farm Bill) established the Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements programs under Title IX, Section 9006.  The Farm Bill requires the Secretary of Agriculture to create a program to make direct loans, loan guarantees, and grants to farmers, ranchers, and rural small businesses to purchase renewable energy systems and make energy efficiency improvements.   Beginning in fiscal year 2003, the Federal Government is providing mandatory funding of $23 million in budget authority annually for 5 years.  The Farm Bill also mandates the maximum percentage the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will provide in funding for these types of projects.  The direct loan, guarantee loan, and grant financing in any combination will not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of the project.  If the project consists of grant only funding, USDA will not exceed 25 percent of the total project cost. The Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS), an Agency within USDA, has been assigned the task of developing, implementing, and managing these programs.  RBS is experienced in guaranteed and direct lending and grants that assist businesses in rural areas.  However, the renewable energy programs mandated by the Farm Bill are entirely unique and new in nature, scope and complexity to RBS.  Guidelines will need to be established, regulations promulgated, and a delivery model created and adopted by our current field structure to ensure that the programs will be successfully implemented.   A Rural Energy Workgroup has been instituted, which consists of RBS employees, officials of other Federal Departments, and additional USDA personnel who will be the subject matter experts and help design these programs.  RBS has limited staff to devote to the task of promulgating regulations, and in an effort to expedite this high profile initiative, needs assistance in completing this assignment. 2. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project is to design and implement the Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements programs.  RBS desires to contract for services to plan, design, and write these program regulations and associated administrative guidelines with direction and input from the Rural Energy Workgroup.  RBS has developed the tasks requiring assistance from a contractor.   3. Tasks:  A. Research Information on Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements: The contractor will research as necessary Federal and state laws and regulations to find other programs pertaining to renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements, compare program criteria including any statutory requirements, and develop a chart or table summarizing the findings.  This should also include researching the environmental requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the permitting requirements of the various Federal agencies that monitor or have oversight responsibilities for renewable energy systems, such as the Department of Energy.  The contractor will be privy to information or research findings of the Rural Energy Workgroup or any stakeholder meetings to avoid duplication of efforts. B. Develop Regulatory Impact and Cost Benefit Analyses: Based upon research conducted, the contractor will develop the regulatory and cost benefit analyses required by the Office and Management and Budget (OMB).  The contractor may work with the Economic Research Service or any other Agency in USDA that provides statistical information on rural area demographics and rural economies in determining the economic impact of renewable energy systems owned and operated by farmers, ranchers, or small businesses.  The Agency will provide guidance and direction in the regulatory requirements for completing the analyses and general USDA contact information as needed. C. Develop and Design the Federal Register Proposed Rule Document(s): The contractor shall develop and deliver draft proposed rule document(s) in accordance with the requirements of the Agency and the Office of the Federal Register.  This will include incorporating statutory criteria as well as regulatory requirements developed by the Rural Energy Workgroup.  After the Agency reviews the draft document(s) and makes comments, the contractor will revise the document(s) and provide a new draft as necessary through the clearance process.  A final draft will be provided to the Agency in duplicate along with a computer diskette containing the document(s).  The Agency will be responsible for obtaining USDA internal regulatory clearances and publication in the Federal Register. D. Related Agency Instructions: The contractor shall assist in the creation of Agency Instructions for use by RBS field office staff in accordance with the requirements of the Agency Regulations Paperwork and Management Branch (RPMD).  This will include adding administrative text developed by the Rural Energy Workgroup to the Federal Register document(s).  This task needs to be completed simultaneously with the development of the Federal Register document(s).  After the Agency reviews the draft instructions and makes comments, the contractor will revise the document(s) and provide a new draft as necessary through the clearance process.  The final instructions will be provided to the Agency in duplicate along with a computer diskette containing the document(s).  The Agency will provide the formatting requirements of RPMD, administrative text developed by the Rural Energy Workgroup to be included in the instructions, and take responsibility for obtaining the regulatory clearances. E. Develop Paperwork Burden Package: The contractor shall develop and deliver the paperwork burden package in accordance with the requirements of OMB.  This will include estimating the time involved by an applicant in applying for monetary assistance under the program and identifying the actual burden on the public in terms of time (hours) and paperwork.  This task needs to be completed simultaneously with the development of the Federal Register document(s) and Agency Instructions.  After the Agency reviews the draft paperwork burden package and makes comments, the contractor will revise the document and provide a new draft as necessary through the clearance process.  The final package will be provided to the Agency in duplicate along with a computer diskette containing the document(s).  The Agency will provide OMB requirements and take responsibility for obtaining the regulatory clearances.  The proposed rule, Agency instructions, and paperwork burden document must travel together in the clearance process. F. Develop Forms for Public and Agency Use: The contractor shall develop and deliver any forms determined by the Agency as necessary for the implementation and delivery of the Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements programs.  Additionally, the contractor will develop and deliver forms for use by the Agency in evaluating or processing an application. This task needs to be completed simultaneously with the development of the Federal Register document(s), Agency Instructions, and the Paperwork Burden Package.  After the Agency reviews the draft forms and makes comments, the contractor will revise the forms and provide a new draft as necessary through the clearance process.  The draft documents will be provided to the Agency in duplicate along with a computer diskette containing the form(s).  The software used by the contractor must be approved by the Agency.  The Agency will provide the criteria needed to complete the form development and obtain OMB clearance of the forms.  The forms must be approved before the final rule is published.  All forms, templates, or software developed as a result of this contract becomes the property of the Agency. G. Develop Federal Register Final Rule Document(s): The contractor shall develop and deliver final rule document(s) in accordance with the requirements of the Agency and the Office of the Federal Register.  The contractor will incorporate the comments made by the public on the proposed rule publication and any other changes to the final rule determined by the Agency.  A final document will be provided to the Agency in duplicate along with a computer diskette containing the final rule document(s).  The Agency will be responsible for obtaining regulatory clearances and publication in the Federal Register. Security Requirements: The contractor personnel assigned to this project shall not require access to classified information.  However, there are Confidentially issues: Confidential information may be presented to the contractor for inclusion in their efforts.  This would include information or data submitted by, or pertaining to, an institution or organization.  This information may require special consideration with regard to the timing of its disclosure. The contractor is required to maintain confidentially on all specific information, or categories of information, which the Agency indicates, must remain confidential.  As such, confidential information must not be disclosed without the prior written consent of the Agency. The contractor must agree to keep all information contained in source documents, or any other media, furnished by the Agency in the strictest of confidence.  The contractor must take all reasonable measures to restrict access to this material to those employees needing the information to perform the work required by this statement of work. THE ANTICIPATED PROJECT START DATE WOULD BE MARCH 3, 2003. The total period of performance would be 14 months from the date of award.

(v)  The contract line item and research specifications are as follows:  CLIN 1. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIRED FIELDWORK:  The primary object of this research is to test respondents' familiarity with and reactions to individual musical selections, as identified by brief, easily recognizable excerpts, usually lasting between 5 and 10 seconds in length.   Details of required fieldwork are as follows:  ( a) Research shall be conducted on a weekly basis for a period of ten weeks starting in February or March 2003, at a date to be agreed upon between IBB and the awardee.  A fresh sample of 50 respondents shall be recruited each week, as described below.   (b) Sample universe shall be the adult populations between the ages of 17 and 28 (inclusive) of the following cities:  Amman, Alexandria, Beirut, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi.  Research in Alexandria and Beirut shall take place bi-weekly, with research alternating each week between the two cities; similarly, research in Kuwait and Abu Dhabi shall take place bi-weekly, alternating in the same fashion.  In Amman, the research shall take place weekly.  Thus the final deliverables will be results from: 10 weeks of research in Amman and 5 weeks each in Alexandria, Beirut, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi.  (c)  In the initial stage of sampling, recognized probability techniques shall be used to select households for screening to ascertain the presence of eligible household members.  In the event that a selected household does not contain any members eligible for this study, or eligible members within the household refuse to participate, successive additional households shall be identified, again based on recognized probability techniques, until a substitute respondent has been successfully recruited.  In no case shall more than one respondent be drawn from the same household.  (d) Screening criteria and quotas: All respondents shall fall in the SES categories A, B, C1, or C2, as these categories are commonly defined by market research agencies in the countries concerned.  Proportions of each week's sample in each group should roughly follow the underlying population distribution; in no case should the total proportion of A/B individuals in a weekly sample exceed 20%.  Each weekly sample should be approximately half male and half female.  In addition, approximately half of each weekly sample should be between the ages of 17-22 (inclusive) with the other half between the ages of 23 and 28 (inclusive).  All respondents should listen to music at least one hour per week and should listen to music on the radio at least 30 minutes per week.  All potential respondents shall be screened for musical preferences, and all who dislike contemporary Western music shall be eliminated from the sample.  (e) Interviews shall take place in the respondent's home, with interviewer playing musical hooks on a CD or tape player provided by the contractor.  (f) Interviewers shall employ a questionnaire requiring respondent to indicate familiarity with each song played, as well as favorability rating for each song with which respondent is familiar.  The questionnaire will contain up to five minutes of additional questions, to be determined by IBB in consultation with the awardee.  (f) Approximately 70 songs shall be tested each week, using hooks to be provided by IBB. It is expected that weekly compilation of hooks will be provided electronically to contractor as MP3 files.  RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONTRACTOR: The contractor shall be responsible for the project design, drafting, translation, formatting, adaptation, and printing of the survey instruments; developing the sampling plan and screening procedures; training interviewers; supervising fieldwork; cleaning and encoding survey responses; entering and processing the data; preparing tabulations in data books; submitting data in electronic form, and communicating all necessary information and results to IBB, Office of Research in a timely manner.

<DESC>NA The US Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Acquisition Center-Washington, on behalf of the CECOM Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Countermine Division, Humanitarian Demining Team, plans to negotiate and award sole source , Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract to Stolar Research Corporation for the enhancement of Electromagnetic wave Detection and Imaging Transceiver (EDIT) landmine detector in an effort to increase its probability of detection and reduce false alarm rate.   The ED IT landmine detector was developed by Stolar Research Corporation formally known as 'Raton Technology Research' under the US Humanitarian Demining Program to detect and image of shallow-buried metallic and nonmetallic landmines.   The EDIT landmine detecto r is a handheld detector and features a detection sensor which based upon the application of a Resonant Microstrip Patch Antenna (RMPA); an imaging that displays the change in the impedance of RMPA from its calibrated value to form real-time silhouettes of  buried objects; a tracking of a sensor head within survey area; and powered by 12V rechargeable battery.  The sensor head-tracking feature provides an additional benefit of showing the operator if an area has been missed during the scan of the suspect are a.  Under this effort the contractor will be required to improve the overall performance of the EDIT landmine detector through performance of the following tasks; 1) Integrate a newly developed Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometer for self-c ontained sensor-head tracking feature to enable the sensor head speed as well as position tracking; 2) Upgrade original 486 microcomputer with QNX operating system to the Intel StrongARM processor and the Microsoft CE operating system; 3) Implement color g raphical user interface (GUI) and enhance the user interface for ease of calibration and operation; 4) Develop an artificial intelligence  algorithms to determine the frequency of maximum scattering cross section and also to characterize and identify of a buried landmine; 5) Redesign the hardware for the reduction of  weight to 3.5 pounds; and 6) Conduct multiple data collections and field tests at Gov't designated test sites.  It has been determined that Stolar Research Corporation is the 'Only One Respons ible Source and no other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements'.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1); Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requ irements.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to enter into a sole source contract with Incyte Genomics, 3160 Porter Drive, Palo Alto, CA 94304, to acquire one set of Mouse Unigene I Easy to Spot PCR Products.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  Incyte is the only provider of this unique set.  The Center for Cancer Research maintains a state-of-the-art facility for the production of gene microarrays.  The microarrays allow researchers to study simultaneously by differential expression of large numbers of cancer genes in normal and disease or treated cells.  The CCR Microarray Facility uses modern lab automation and robotic methods to "print" these arrays by spotting small volumes of prepared cDNA clones (PCR products) at specific locations on specially prepared glass slides.  (PCR products of cDNA clones from multiple thousands of genes can localize to a small glass slide). The composition of the PCR sets and quality controls used in their manufacture are critically important for the continuation of existing experimental protocols and standards.  The NCI/CCR Microarray facility has ongoing projects utilizing Incyte products previously (263-MQ-207628), having produced thousands of microarrays which are in use by intramural investigators and the NIH Mouse Models of Human Disease Consortium.  An important aspect is, the clones are not full-length copies of the genes of interest but, are biased towards the 3' end of the gene.  In practical terms, this means that clone form the same genes but,  generated from other vendors, will have a different composition.  It is critical for experimental continuity and reproducibility that the NCI/CCR continue to acquire from this source.  Incyte Genomics,  Inc. is the only source know to the Government that can meet the required specifications.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  Capability statements and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain sufficient material to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 EST (local Washington, DC time) on January 15, 2003.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253 (1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  If you have questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Malinda Holdcraft at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or via fax at 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No faxed copies of capability statements will be accepted.  No electronic copies of capability statements will be accepted.  If interested in submitting a capability statement, please mail one (1) original and two (2) copies to: Malinda Holdcraft, NIH/NCI/RCB, 6120 Executive Blvd. Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852-7194.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

4.	SECONDARY SELETION CRITERIA.  The following secondary criteria will not be applied by the pre-selection board, and will only be used by a selection board as a "tie-breaker" if necessary, in ranking the most highly qualified firm(s).  The secondary criteria will not be commingled with the primary criteria in any type of scoring or evaluation system.  The secondary selection criteria are listed below in descending order of importance.  

a.

<CONTACT>Elaine Radcliffe, (912) 652-5416
<DESC>NA Contract Information:  Architect-Engineer Firms should note that this announcement is a change over the Savannah Districts previous policy for selection of Architect-Engineering firms.  In lieu of a single annual announcement, an announcement for Architec t-Engineer services will be made every quarter or as needed.  Architect-Engineer firms will be required to resubmit their statements of qualifications (SF 254 and SF 255) for each quarterly announcement. **** The Savannah District, U.S. Army Corps of Engin eers requires the services of Architect-Engineer firms for a minimum of one and a maximum of four Multidiscipline Indefinite Delivery Contracts. Note that this announcement is a shift in the previous method of Architect-Engineering IDC contracting done by the Savannah District.  Offerors are cautioned to read the announcement in its entirety.  Contracts awarded as a result of this announcement will be administered by Savannah District for use on federal projects (civil and military) under its jurisdiction a nd, if requested, for other Corps of Engineers Districts within the South Atlantic Division. Contract limits and contract size will be determined at the time of selection. Typically, each contract will consist of a base ordering period and two option perio ds, each period not to exceed one year, for a total of three years maximum. An option may be exercised before the expiration of the base contract period (or option period) if the contract amount has been exhausted or nearly exhausted. The total of all task  orders during each ordering period may not exceed $1,000,000. Individual task orders may not exceed $1,000,000. The total amount of each contract over the three-year ordering period may not exceed $3,000,000. Task Orders will be primarily for large projec ts with a construction value greater than $2 million, however as required, smaller projects will be executed under these contracts. These task orders are firm fixed priced. This announcement is open to all businesses. Small businesses are encouraged to tea m with other small businesses. The firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently. Proposals will be evaluated on each of the criteria factors listed below.  Each factor will be assigned a rating from outstanding to unsatisfactory based on the risk to the government that the offeror will successfully perform the factor being evaluated.  An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission.  Contracts may be issued up to one year after selection approval.  Awar d will be made to the firm(s) determined to be most highly qualified.  The number of contracts that will be issued will be dependent on the amount of work that will be required. None of these projects are yet authorized and funds are not presently availabl e. Assignment of individual task orders to the contracts with identical scopes of work will be based upon the following factors: (1) Performance and quality of deliverables under the current IDC contracts, (2) Current capacity of the firm to accomplish the  task order in the required time, (3) Proximity of the firm to the project site and familiarity with design criteria/codes and construction methods used at the locality (4) Equitable distribution of work among identical contracts. The NAICS is 541330; size  standard $4 million. This announcement is open to all firms regardless of size. Large business firms that intend to do any subcontracting must convey their intent to meet the minimum small business goals on the SF 255, Block 6, by identifying subcontracti ng opportunities with small business. If selected, the large business offeror will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52-219.9 and DFARS 219.704/705 as a part of the Request for Proposal package. The following  subcontracting goals are the minimum acceptable goals to be included in the subcontracting plan.

Written justification must be provided if the minimum small business goals cannot be met. The small business subcontracting plan will be evaluated in accordance with AFAR 19.7, Appendix DD. For additional information, please contact Gwen Park er at (912) 652-5340. **** Project Information: Work may consist of preparation of reports, studies, project planning, design criteria, cost estimates utilizing the MCACES software, specifications, designs, and other general A-E services for multi-discipli ned new construction and renovations projects for military and other government agencies.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO POST THE ANSWERS TO THE FOLLOWING FIVE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED BY VARIOUS VENDORS.

1.	How accessible is the transformer, are there any obstacles a crane needs to be concerned with when trying to move the unit? ANSWER. No overhead obstacles.  A 6-foot high fence surrounds transformer.  It is 20 feet from fence to center of transformer.
2.	Can you supply overall dimensions and dimensions with the bushings removed so handling and shipping can be decided? ANSWER. Overall Height is 134 inches xWidth 140 inches Length 165inches. HV bushing is 21 inches  tall.  Arresters are 24 inches, LV bushing is 14  inches.  
3.	Is previous test result available on the transformer? ANSWER. No, transformer is only about 5 years old.
4.	Is information available about what going on before and during the failure? ANSWER. HV bushing was discolored, so it was decided to change it, we pumped down the oil and went and changed the bushing, then pumped the oil back in.  When we reenergized the transformer, it failed. Upon inspection it appeared that the no-load tap changer may have been accidentally bumped because that is where it looks like it started arching and copper from that may have shorted the HV windings to LV windings.

5.  What is the weight of the transformer?  ANSWER. The approximate weight of the transformer is as follows:  Core and Coils 22,500 lbs, Tanks and fittings 18,400 lbs, Type II Mineral Oil; Main Tank (2,190 gallons) 16,000 lbs, LTC Tank (150 gallons) 1,100 lbs.  Total weight with oil is 58,000 lbs.

<DESC>Clarifications to M-OP-HRAM-AFM-01-002

Question 1. Would you by any chance know the expected number of Designated Contractors (DCs) that will access the web-portal or for whom payment/record services will be provided either monthly, quarterly or yearly? 

Answer:  It is not known at this time.

Question 2. Would you be recommending that the DCs use the accounting features that 
Contractors programs could provide through the web -portal?

Answer:  Yes.

Question 3.  If DCs should adopt #2 above who will be responsible to pay the related  
fees? DCs or USAID?

Answer:  The DCs would be responsible to do so.

Question 4. When will work begin in 2003?

Answer:  The timeframe will depend on the completion of the evaluation process but it will be implemented expeditiously.

Question 5. Is this work currently being performed by a contractor?  If so Who is 
providing it?

Answer:  No, there is no incumbent nor anyone providing this service.

Question 6. How many transactions are expected to be performed in a typical week or 
month? 

Answer:  It is unknown at this time.  It will depend on the need of USAID and the availability of the DCs.

Question 7. Is the government estimate of $5M for one year or for the whole duration of 
the contract period 2003 to 2007?

Answer:  The whole contract period through 2007.

Question 8.  Will a more detailed RFP be issued through FedBizOpps?  If so, can you tell me what the projected release date will be?

Answer:  No.  The synopsis and solicitation were combined within this notice.

Question 9.    General services requested:  It is unclear as to whether USAID is seeking ?
a. a technology provider/integrator to aggregate and facilitate transactions between existing systems and provide appropriate portal interfaces to make accessing such information easier for the USAID CTO and DCs.  Is this a portal to access many different systems?
b. a technology and service provider to provide a complete turnkey system that performs such requirements natively, including building a datawarehouse/central repository of DC information with appropriate interfaces for USAID personnel and/or DCs; or
c. an employment services firm to perform either of the above in addition to the provision and administration of employee benefits packages

Answer:  The need will be determined through the proposed methods provided by the Contractor for DC use. 

Question 10.  SOW states The Contractor must provide USAID with invoices, payment, and online administration services for USAIDs current and anticipated future assignments.  As this is a Firm Fixed Price contract, please specify what the anticipated future assignments are.

Answer:  The DC assignments as they are needed and any technological changes as systems are updated and developed throughout the upcoming years.

Question 11.  SOW states:  enable DCs to register, enroll, or otherwise effect their transition through a secure web-based systems architecture (including access to W-4 forms, insurance forms, and others as designated by USAID);   Is the Contractor system intended to interface with pre-existing systems such as the insurance forms?  If so, please define the system and relevant interface capabilities.  

Answer: No.  The Contractor will need to propose a way to provide this need within their proposal.

Question 12.  SOW states:  provide DCs with the option to participate in Contractor-sponsored benefits programs; pre-tax health, dental, vision, and life insurance plans (to be designed by the Contractor as part of this engagement);  What is the actual intent of USAID and their DCs for this?  The employee/employer relationship required for these types of benefits does not seem feasible through to a Contractors benefit program.  Please confirm that the Contractor is responsible for providing a benefits package to the DCs.  Please define the baseline benefits package requirements/contents.  Please define how the reimbursement of the benefits package component will occur if this is a Firm Fixed Price contract?  Please define the quantity and geographical distribution of the DCs relative to these requirements.  Please define how the scope of provision of the benefits package will be weighed in the contract evaluation.

Answer:  The Contractor again is responsible to propose a way to provide the requirements needed.  The entire proposal will be evaluated based on the stated criterias within the solicitation.

Question 13.  SOW states:  provide timely and accurate DC payment that is based on DCs time sheet and expense records approved by the CTO. USAID funding release shall be no later than 7 days from receipt of invoice submission;  Please define the methods available for funds disbursement.  Please confirm whether the GSA-SmartPay government-wide Purchase Card is an authorized method of payment.

Answer:  The Contractor will provide a method of doing so within their proposal.  

Question 14.  SOW states:  enable DCs to review the status of their accounts through the online system, or develop contingency processes that can replace any or all online activities in the event of a DCs inability to access the Internet.   Is the requirement for the Contractor based on the DCs temporary inability to access the internet (i.e.: provide an IVR system as a backup) or based on a requirement that some DCs do not have internet access at all and parallel, manual systems must be deployed to support these DCs.  If the latter case, then please define the scope and quantity of DCs that are in this category and define whether all services must be available or just certain core services.

Answer:  This need is stated within the requirement for all DC usage.  It is not known who has and does not have Internet access.

Question 15.  SOW states:  provide a monthly status report monitoring the quality assurance, configuration management, and security management through in-progress Develop contingency processes that can replace any or all online activities in the event of a DCs inability to access the Internet .  What does this mean?  It looks like two paragraphs combined.  Please clarify.

Answer:  A status reporting method will be needed.  If for any reason the Internet is not available, an alternative means would be used and necessary.

Question 16.  SOW states:  Provide appropriate DC orientation and training materials, including (but not limited to): time entry instructions, expense entry instructions, benefits overviews, and instructions on receiving additional support.  Please define training requirements ? online self/help, in person training - centrally or decentrally, telephonic requirements, published materials requirements, support hours, number of DCs, language or localization issues.

Answer:  The Contractor is responsible to provide a method within their proposal and demonstrated through past performance references.

Question 17.  USAID Responsibilities section is unclear.  Are these data feeds to Contractor with DC information?  If so, with what frequency, format, etc.

Answer:  Yes.  The methods and use will be formulated on the basis of the proposals.
 
Question 18.  What is the start up period for the customization required for the unique administrative and financial record types to be integrated with unique USAID systems? What integration must occur and with what USAID systems?  What USAID resources (personnel, third parties, etc) are supporting or involved in the project?

Answer:  The start-up period and other integration will be provided contingent with the proposals submitted to USAID.
 
Question 19.  Please provide a volumetric/scope profile in terms of:  
How many DCs will participate in this process? Are some of the DCs overseas? If so how many and where?
What are the number of transactions that will go through this process? 
What is the dollar volume of payments expected to the DCs?

Answer:  It is not known at this time the volume of DCs.  Your proposal should address a percentage for use of the required service.

Question 20.  Are there any restrictions for the RFQ submission? 

Answer:  No.  The RFQ submission should address the stated needs of the requirement. 


Question 21.  Will there be an extension to this requirement and if not, why? 

Answer:  No.  This requirement asks that you provide a percentage based quote for services and past performance references.  Based on the limited request and the immediate need of the USAID office, the time period will not be extended.

A/E contractors will only have to provide this information once with annual updates or as key company information changes occur.  Registration can be accomplished through the World Wide Web at http//www.acq.mil/ec; through any DOD Certified Value Added Network; or a paper may be obtained by calling the DOD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.

Concepts for:  (1) trustworthy computing in mobile environments, (2) defenses against large-scale malicious code attacks, (3) improvements to and acceleration of Battle Damage Assessment, with a particular interest in opportunities to provide real-time quantitative functional damage assessments from within the small radius of the target aimpoint, (4) ultra-maneuverable, supersonic munitions for air/land/sea engagements, (5) earth-penetrating payload carriers capable of holding buried and hardened targets at risk (6) flight controls & Human Machine Interface to minimize pilot training time, (7) multi-mode dynamic waveforms, (8) dynamic wireless topology control for bursty channels with highly directional antenna, (9) hybrid router for dynamic links/channels with dual physical layers (radio frequency/optical), (10), hybrid radio frequency/free space optical aperture concepts, (11) common radio frequency/optical backend, (12) high data rate underwater communication, (13) sensor development, for unambiguous determination of multiple chemical species, (14) identification and geolocation of threats to mobile U. S. forces, (15) all optical networks, (16) novel approaches to the development, implementation and control of networked weapons systems, (17) enabling technologies for littoral warfare.  Additional technical areas and proposal instructions may be added through an amendment to this BAA throughout CY 2003.

GENERAL INFORMATION
This notice, in conjunction with the BAA03-06 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), constitutes the total BAA.  Therefore, proposers should obtain a pamphlet entitled ?BAA03-06 Advanced Technologies? Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) in order to submit information under this BAA.

For this BAA, IN PARTICULAR, offerors, are cautioned to pay special attention to the instructions delineated in the PIP with respect to submission of information for funding consideration.  The Government has delineated a three-step, sequential process, that offerors should follow including the submission of an Executive Summary, Proposal Abstract, and finally a Full Proposal, in that order.  This sequential review is intended to expedite Government review of submitted information and minimize unnecessary expense on the part of those responding to this BAA.  

The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the ideas presented for review.  Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to fund all, some, or none of the total effort associated with these ideas.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government?s needs are encouraged to submit their ideas.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit ideas and join others in doing so; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.

All questions pertaining to this BAA, including requests for information on how to submit information under this BAA, should be directed to the administrative contact phone number, fax number, physical address, or email listed below (NOTE:  e-mail is highly preferred).  DARPA intends to use electronic mail, WWW, and/or fax for correspondence regarding BAA03-06.  Information formally submitted in response to this BAA by offerors, however, to include Executive Summary?s, Proposal Abstracts, and Full Proposals, must strictly adhere to the instructions contained in the PIP.  Failure to adhere to the instructions in the PIP may result in the offeror?s submission being rejected. 

This notice, in conjunction with the BAA03-06 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  Updates to this BAA, including additional technical topic areas of specific interest, and other changes as necessary, may be posted throughout the year at the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov, and World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit.htm.

STEP 3:  Full Proposal ? Submission of a Full Proposal for evaluation.  A typical proposal should express a consolidated effort in support of the ideas and/or concepts discussed in the Executive Summary and Proposal Abstract.  Disjointed efforts or approaches should not be included in a single proposal.  For purposes of this BAA, a ?proposal? is the two-volume document that conforms to the form and format requirements specified herein.  Other supporting or background materials submitted with proposals or other such extraneous materials will not be considered part of a proposal for the purpose of a proposal?s evaluation.  Any total effort, including options, shall not exceed five (5) years.  Teaming and cost sharing are acceptable to the extent that they are meaningful and beneficial to the Government but are not required.

Offerors may be foreign firms or may team with foreign firms as long as the firm meets criteria in this solicitation and the Government is permitted to conduct business with the firm. Offerors may also include foreign personnel as part of their proposed resources as long as these personnel qualify technically and possess the proper security clearances ultimately required.  

Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals, and to join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside for HBCUs or MIs because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research and development in the technologies sought.

Additional guidance concerning classified information may be obtained from atosecurity@darpa.mil, (703) 696-2291.

Proprietary Data:  All proposals containing proprietary data should have the cover page and each page containing proprietary data clearly marked as containing proprietary data.  It is the Offeror?s responsibility to clearly define to the Government what is considered proprietary data.

Proposals, however, may contain either proprietary or classified information or data (up to the level of Top Secret/SCI).

Offerors must have existing and in-place prior to execution of an award, approved capabilities (personnel and facilities) to perform research and development at the classification level they propose. It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information, and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation.  Proposals will not be returned.  The original of each proposal received will be retained at DARPA and all other non-required copies destroyed.  A certification of destruction may be requested, provided that the formal request is received at this office within 5 days after unsuccessful notification.

Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflicts of Interest.  All offerors and proposed subcontractors must, therefore, affirm whether they are providing scientific, engineering and technical assistance (SETA), or similar support, to any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract numbers.  Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined at FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.

The Government intends to use employees and subcontractors of Adroit Systems, Inc. (ASI) of Alexandria, Virginia to assist in administering the evaluation of the proposals and to provide advice regarding portions of the technical content of the proposals to the Government evaluators.  These personnel will have signed, and will be subject to, the terms and conditions of non-disclosure agreements.  By submission of its proposal, an offeror agrees that its proposal information may be disclosed to employees of ASI for the limited purpose stated above.  Only Government evaluators, however, will make technical evaluations and award determinations under this BAA.

As proposal evaluations are completed, offerors will be notified that: 1) its proposal has been accepted and the effort will be funded, 2) its proposal has been accepted pending the availability of funds, or 3) its proposal has not been accepted.  Unless otherwise advised by the offeror at the time of submission, copies of non-accepted proposals will be destroyed; however, the original of non-accepted proposals will be retained and filed.

Not all proposals evaluated and deemed acceptable will be funded.  Decisions to fund acceptable proposals will be based on funds available, scientific and technical merit, and potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission.  Proposals may be considered for funding during the period in which this BAA is open. 

Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, technology investment agreement, or other transaction for prototypes.  This will depend upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options.

This BAA shall be open until 1600, Eastern Standard Time, 31 December 2003.

EVALUATION CRITERIA
The evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance:
l) Overall scientific and technical merit in relationship to the revolutionary aspects of approach; the scientific and technical merit of the proposed approach to research, soundness of proposed work, and probability of success will be evaluated; 2) Potential contribution to the DARPA Mission of the proposed effort to relevance and contribution to the national technology base will be evaluated; 3) Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience to perform the stated work will be examined.  In particular, the qualifications of Principal Investigators will be considered.  The range, depth, and mix of expertise of the Offeror?s key personnel will be evaluated to ensure that they are qualified in the theory and application of the technologies involved in the research, development, testing, and evaluation of the proposed technology; 4) Approach to Technology Transition and capability to transition the technology to the research, industrial, and operational military communities in such a way as to enhance U.S. defense; and 5) Cost Realism will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror?s estimate is reasonable and realistic for the technical and management approach offered, as well as to determine the Offeror?s practical understanding of the effort.  This will be principally measured by cost per labor-hour and number of labor-hours proposed.  The evaluation criteria recognize that undue emphasis on cost may motivate bidders to propose low-risk ideas with minimum uncertainty and to staff the effort with junior personnel in order to be in a more competitive posture.  DARPA/ATO discourages such cost strategies.  Cost reduction approaches that will be received favorably include innovative management concepts that maximize direct funding for technology and limit diversion of funds into overhead.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
DARPA?s Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting ideas for innovative concepts and technologies relating to advances in Robust Networking and Communications, Intelligence Preparation of the Battlesphere (IPB), Information Assurance (IA), Biological technologies, Maritime, Special Operations, and technologies that provide unconventional advantages over adversaries or potential adversaries.  The objective of this search is to enable revolutionary advances in warfighting capability.  To achieve this objective, offerors should emphasize radical concepts that may contain high technical risk but if enabled would have commensurate high military payoff.  The Government is not interested in extensions to existing DARPA programs or minor improvements to operational capability.  Rather, DARPA is seeking concepts that will provide either an entirely new military capability or will enhance existing capability by orders of magnitude (based on demonstrable relevant metrics).  Offerors should initially be prepared to support the technical feasibility of their concept or idea, then be prepared to demonstrate and discuss successive phases leading toward technology development.  As such, offerors successfully concluding the steps of Executive Summary, and Proposal Abstract, described herein, should be prepared to propose a base effort supporting the technical feasibility of their concept or idea, then be prepared to propose pre-priced options or subsequent phases that further lead toward technology development.  It is envisioned that the base effort proposed will not exceed 12 months, and each successive phase or option proposed will not exceed 12 months.  Offerors should not propose total efforts exceeding 60 months.  Any such proposal doing so maybe disregarded.  Multiple awards during CY 2003 are anticipated.

This notice, in conjunction with the BAA03-06 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  Updates to this BAA, including additional technical topic areas of specific interest, and other changes as necessary, may be posted throughout the year at the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov, and World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit.htm.  In the event of any discrepancy between the information delineated at http://www.fedbizopps.gov and http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit.htm, the http://www.fedbizopps.gov site takes precedence.

TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS
Any technical area that falls within the scope of the topics listed in the Program Objectives described herein are considered acceptable.  The following, but not limited to, areas are of specific interest.  Concepts for:  (1) trustworthy computing in mobile environments, (2) defenses against large-scale malicious code attacks, (3) improvements to and acceleration of Battle Damage Assessment, with a particular interest in opportunities to provide real-time quantitative functional damage assessments from within the small radius of the target aimpoint, (4) ultra-maneuverable, supersonic munitions for air/land/sea engagements, (5) earth-penetrating payload carriers capable of holding buried and hardened targets at risk (6) flight controls & Human Machine Interface to minimize pilot training time, (7) multi-mode dynamic waveforms, (8) dynamic wireless topology control for bursty channels with highly directional antenna, (9) hybrid router for dynamic links/channels with dual physical layers (radio frequency/optical), (10), hybrid radio frequency/free space optical aperture concepts, (11) common radio frequency/optical backend, (12) high data rate underwater communication, (13) sensor development, for unambiguous determination of multiple chemical species, (14) identification and geolocation of threats to mobile U. S. forces, (15)all optical networks, (16) novel approaches to the development, implementation and control of networked weapons systems, (17) enabling technologies for littoral warfare.  Additional technical areas and proposal instructions may be added through an amendment to this BAA throughout CY 2003.

INFORMATION EVALUATION AND DETERMINATION OF ACCEPTABLE SOURCES
In order to reduce the administrative burden on proposers and the Government, and in an attempt to mitigate unnecessary costs associated with the generation of proposals that are not of interest to DARPA/ATO, described herein is the Government?s process for submittal of information for evaluation.  Any responsible offeror is encouraged to respond.  

STEP 1:  Executive Summary - Initial offeror submissions to the Government should be a One Page Executive Summary ONLY.  The purpose of the executive summary is to give the proposer the opportunity to solicit early feedback from the Government as to whether or not the research proposed will be of interest to DARPA/ATO.  It is thus in the submitter?s best interest to clearly articulate the innovative concept and technology development needed with respect to demonstrable metrics.  The submission of the executive summary is intended to avoid unnecessary expense in proposal generation for ideas that will not be selected within this BAA.  DARPA/ATO will endeavor to respond to executive summaries in an expeditious and timely manner.  If DARPA/ATO does not have interest in your Executive Summary you will be notified by both email and a formal letter (if a valid company address is provided) and the process will end at this point.  If DARPA/ATO is interested in receiving more information on your submission, you will be notified by both email and a formal letter (if a valid company address is provided) informing you of the Program Manager (PM) to whom your Executive Summary has been assigned.  Offerors should then expect to proceed to Step 2, Proposal Abstract, (see below). 

Executive Summary Format & Submittal Information
The executive summary should be clearly marked "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY" and the total length shall not exceed one (1) page.  All pages should be able to be printed on normal-weight 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper with type not smaller than 12 point.  The page limitation for executive summaries includes all point of contact information, figures, tables, and charts.  Do not submit additional copies of the same executive summary for different technical topic areas.  If an executive summary applies to more than one area, simply indicate that fact.  Proposers must submit their One Page Executive Summary as an attachment to an email addressed to the email administrative point of contact delineated in this BAA.  The attachment must be capable of being readable by Microsoft Word 97 or higher.  The subject line of the email should include the following: ?Executive Summary submitted under BAA03-06 by:  [INSERT NAME OF COMPANY] for [INSERT IDEA/CONCEPT PROPOSED].  Facsimile or hard copy submissions will be disregarded. 

Final Submission Date for Executive Summary?s:  This BAA shall be open from 1 January 2003 through 31 December 2003.  While the government may choose to review Executive Summary?s up to 31 December 2003, for practicality purposes, offerors choosing to submit ideas under this BAA are strongly encouraged and advised to submit Executive Summary?s no later than 1600, Eastern Standard Time, Friday, 17 October 2003.

STEP 2:  Proposal Abstract - Discussion with a DARPA/ATO PM and submission of a Proposal Abstract.  Discussions at this step with the DARPA/ATO PM are intended to further explore the concepts, ideas, and other areas of interest presented in the Executive Summary.  Offerors will be able to further discuss the technical merits of their concept with a DARPA/ATO Program Manager.  The purpose of the Proposal Abstract is to permit the submitter to present a more detailed explanation of the idea/concept, its technical merit and military relevance.  The submitter should articulate the innovative concept and technology development needed with respect to demonstrable metrics.  The submission of the Proposal Abstract should be used by the offeror to avoid unnecessary expense in proposal generation for ideas that may not be selected within this BAA.  Offerors should explain in the Proposal Abstract the feasibility of idea/concept transition to the military, other government agencies or organizations, or other interested users, as applicable.  Additionally, offerors should clearly specify the intended demonstrable improvements over current systems, explain transition paths, specify tentative schedules, and provide a rough estimate of cost.  DARPA/ATO will endeavor to respond to proposal abstracts in an expeditious and timely manner.  If DARPA/ATO does not have any interest in your Proposal Abstract you will be notified by both email and a formal letter (if a valid company address is provided).  If DARPA/ATO is interested in your Proposal Abstract, you will be encouraged by both email and a formal letter (if a valid company address is provided) to submit a full proposal.  Offerors should then expect to proceed to Step 3 delineated below.

Proposal Abstract Format & Submittal Information
The Proposal Abstract should be clearly marked "PROPOSAL ABSTRACT" and the total length shall not exceed six (6) pages.  Proposal abstracts must contain:  Section I of Volume I described under Proposal Format (see below); four (4) page summary of Section II, III, IV; one (1) page summary of Volume II.  All pages should be able to be printed on normal-weight 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper with type not smaller than 12 point.  Do not add card-stock or protective covers.  The page limitation for proposal abstracts includes all figures, tables, and charts.  Three-hole punch each set and bind the original and each copy in the upper left corner only.  No formal transmittal letter is required.  Offerors must submit an original paper copy and one (1) electronic copy readable by Microsoft Word 97 or higher. Do not submit additional copies of the same abstract for different technical topic areas.  If an abstract applies to more than one area, simply indicate that fact.

Final Submission Date for Proposal Abstracts:  This BAA shall be open from 1 January 2003 through 31 December 2003.  While the Government may choose to review proposal abstracts up to 31 December 2003, for practicality purposes, offerors choosing to submit ideas under this BAA are strongly encouraged and advised to submit Proposal Abstracts no later than 1600, Eastern Standard Time, Friday, 31 October 2003.

However, the Postal Service recognizes that technology limitations may or may not support the ultimate vision and could require an interim step that uses flat sorters to sort flats into delivery point walk sequence (Flats Sequencing System (FSS)).  As such, the Postal Service will evaluate and pre-qualify sources for one or both of the approaches discussed below.  

To implement the expressed vision depends on having high-speed mail sorting and packaging equipment that efficiently sorts and merges the letter and flat mail in delivery walk sequence order for the letter carrier.  The equipment must be optimally located to maximize the operational savings, and designed to eliminate the labor-intensive carrier "pull downs" inherent in the existing process. The output should be a series of packaged delivery point, walk-sequenced mail bundles/packets of letters and flats, for the carriers to take directly to the street without the need of additional sortation, casing, or pull-down.  The bundles/packets could be presented to the letter carriers at a central carrier location in a "ready to go" vehicle.  

1.  Flats Sequencing System (FSS):  This system provides flat mail in "Delivery Point Sequence" (DPS) or "walk" sequence to all carriers within one or more delivery zones. Currently, the USPS has sorting equipment to sort letter mail to full DPS level and flat mail to zone and carrier level. The FSS system approach could add flat mail sorting systems to the existing automation fleet to walk sequence flat mail for carriers.  The FSS system must be able to handle all types of flat mail, currently processed by the USPS AFSM100 and the UFSM1000 (upgraded FSM1000) flat mail sorting machines.  The FSS must demonstrate a minimum machine throughput of 40,000 pieces per hour for a single pass operation and/or a cumulative 16,350 pieces per hour for a multi-pass operation.  The FSS may use image processing to automate sorting using bar codes, optical character reading and online video encoding to achieve a minimum of 95% sort rate to the delivery point with an error rate not to exceed 1% of the volume sorted. 

2.  Delivery Point Packager (DPP):  This system provides for an all encompassing, seamless operational approach that results in a single bundle of "packets" containing letters and flats  individually packaged for each delivery point on the carriers' route. To fulfill this vision requires mail sorting and packaging equipment that efficiently sorts, merges and packages the letter and flat mail streams in delivery sequence order for the letter carrier.  The DPP system may result in reduction or complete elimination of some or all, existing USPS mail sorting equipment. A key component of this new approach is a sorting system that assembles a large range of letters and flats into delivery point packages.  The system must accommodate all sizes, and weights of letters and flats.  A DPP sorting system must be able to process all carriers' flat and letter mail for one or more delivery zones and must be capable of sorting the mail volume for the next day's delivery within the time window available. The output volume must meet or exceed the existing carrier volume levels available from current sorting methods.  Current machine throughput for the equipment is 35,000 pieces per hour.  The DPP may use image processing to automate sorting using bar codes, optical character reading and online video encoding to sort all letter and flat mail to the delivery point with an error rate not to exceed 0.5% of the volume sorted.  Potential sources are encouraged to consider completely new system solutions and should not limit themselves to the existing mail processing equipment and sorting processes.

The USPS plans to issue a solicitation to pre-qualified sources in calendar year 2003 Quarter 1.  The solicitation will include system level performance specifications and simulation model requirements.  In Phase I, firms will be asked to submit firm fixed price proposals for conceptual, design, and simulation deliverables.  The Postal Service will evaluate all proposals and anticipates making one or more contract awards.  Phase I awards are planned for calendar year 2003 Quarter 2.  

In Phase II, prototype and/or test bed contracts are planned for only those suppliers that submitted design and simulations that are accepted by the Postal Service.  
	For the FSS suppliers, a contract for a prototype and In-Plant test is planned for calendar year 2004 Quarter 1.  For those who successfully complete the In-Plant test, the Postal Service plans to award a field test contract in calendar year 2004 Quarter 4 for the field tests to be performed in Quarter 2 2005.    
	For the DPP suppliers, a contract for test beds and evaluations is planned for calendar year 2004 Quarter 2.  Test bed evaluations are planned for Quarters 2 and 3, calendar year 2005.

The results of the evaluations will be used to select the approach the Postal Service plans to pursue.  If applicable, build and test contracts for the Phase III will be awarded.  Only firms that receive Phase III test contracts will be considered for subsequent production contract awards.   

To be eligible to participate for either program, interested firms must have deployed mail processing equipment to the USPS or other Postal Administration facilities. Interested suppliers should indicate if they wish to be pre-qualified for FSS, DPP, or both programs.  If interested suppliers plan to team, the submission must include the member parties and their roles.  Interested firms are requested to submit the following information:  (1) a statement of technical capability and personnel resources with demonstrated experience in research and development of mail processing equipment and equipment modifications.  Suppliers may provide written material, drawings, floor space requirements, photographs, and/or videos that demonstrate the machine specifications, listed above; (2) a list of all contracts performed within the last 5 years for similar requirements including contract number, dates of performance, customer's and Contracting Officer's name and phone number, and the dollar value of the contract; (3) quality and reliability data relating to the firm's previously deployed systems; (4) company's most current financial statements, and (5) location of deployed mail processing equipment (country, city, equipment type, quantity).  During the pre-qualification process, the USPS may visit sites identified by the submitting firm to evaluate the machine attributes.  The USPS will evaluate the pre-qualification statements submitted based on the following factors:  (1) technical capability to meet the USPS requirements; (2) past performance and personnel resources; (3) quality and reliability; and (4) financial capability.  The qualification statements may not exceed 50 pages.  

This announcement does not in any way commit the US Postal Service to test or purchase any equipment or make an award.  Any subsequent award is contingent upon USPS funding approval.  Qualified firms should send the required information to Mr. Vance Cathell, Contracting Officer not later than 28 February 2003.  The mailing address is United States Postal Service, Automation CMC, Attention: Mr. Vance Cathell, Contracting Officer, 8403 Lee Highway, Fairfax VA 22082-8150.  Email address is vcathell@email.usps.gov.  All inquiries must be in writing.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is planning to issue a draft RFP in the March 2003 timeframe for the acquisition of Space Mission Communications and Data Services. The SMCDS solicitation will succeed the current NASA Consolidated Space Operations Contract (CSOC), which will expire in December of 2003.	Sources Sought:  NASA is seeking capabilities from small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for this requirement.  Currently, the SMCDS requirement includes six separate work packages.  Marshall Space Flight Center has already conducted market research for two of the work packages (Huntsville Operations Support Center (HOSC) and NASA Integrated Services Network (NISN) ).  This notification requests responses for the four other work packages from that are currently included in the SMCDS requirement (see Work Package and POC list below).  You are requested to provide electronic responses (20 page maximum) via e-mail (including attachments) to the primary POC(s) for the work package(s) that you are interested in and capable of supporting.  Your response is required by January 15, 2003.    To facilitate a prompt review by the NASA team, a one (1) page summary shall be included with your capability statement(s), which identifies your company's specific capabilities that are relevant to the work package(s) you are responding to.  Companies are also requested to provide your name, address, point of contact, average annual revenue for past 3 years, number of employees, and your Government size/type classification (large, small, small disadvantaged, HUBZone, Women-Owned Small Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, and/or a Historically Black College and Universities/Minority Institution) on the summary page.  It is insufficient to provide only general brochures or generic information.  Copies of your capability statements may be made available to SMCDS Prime Contractor competitors in the future, and should therefore not contain company-sensitive information. NASA is also interested in potential prime contractor feedback related to subcontracting opportunities for the various work packages, given the possibility that they may be competed on an unrestricted basis.	This feedback would be used as research information to support the analysis and development of subcontracting goals.  This feedback should also be provided electronically via e-mail to the appropriate work package POC(s) by January 15, 2003. General information about each work package and the SMCDS procurement can be found on the World Wide Web.  The WWW addresses, or URLs, for these draft documents are   http://www.nasa.gov/newsinfo/contracts/smcds.html and http://www.hq.nasa.gov/smcds/.	It is essential that you read this information before preparing your capability statement or subcontracting feedback. Prime Contractor Market Research:  NASA is interested in specific procurement strategy feedback from potential prime contractors.  NASA is considering a procurement approach that will award the best overall combination of contracts for multiple work packages.  This may include a separate contract for each work package.  However, we believe there may be potential efficiency benefits from companies who are capable of performing multiple work packages.  The solicitation may consider these benefits as an evaluation element and could potentially result in multiple contract awards to the same vendor, or combined work packages under individual contract(s).  Potential prime contractors are requested to provide feedback on the types of efficiencies (business or technical) that could be proposed/gained by awarding multiple work packages to the same contractor under multiple contracts or an individual contract.  Prime contractor market research responses should be directed to the NASA SMCDS Contracting Officer, Chris Whyte, at Christopher.d.whyte@nasa.gov, on or before January 15, 2003.  Capability statements and specific work package questions should be directed to the appropriate POC in the following list.

<DESC>SPAWAR SYSTEMS CENTER, SAN DIEGO intends to negotiate a sole-source contract modification with Computer Science Corporation, San Diego, CA under their existing contract N66001-97-D-5007. This action will provide a level of effort increase and extend the period of performance through June 30, 2003 to allow sufficient time to award a competitive follow-on contract. The estimated increase in the level of effort is 70,387 hours. This action will be issued as a sole source modification under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This is not a request for proposal and no solicitation is available.  Questions concerning this sole source modification may be directed to Linda Mulligan at linda.mulligan@navy.mil. The use of any other source for this modification would result in duplication of cost and time to develop the technical capability within another contractor?s workforce resulting in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition. It is contemplated that the solicitation for the follow-on to contract to N66001-97-D-5007 will be available on or about January 15, 2003.
