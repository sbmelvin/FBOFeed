<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is post the answers to questions # 19 and #32; revise the answer to question #22d; increase the maximum threshold; revise Attachment 2, Schedule of Supplies and Services (MS Excel File); and extend the proposal due date and past performance questionnaires to 2:00 pm Wednesday, October 6, 2010.</p>
<p>19. Reference(s): (1) Attachment 1 - Statement of Work and (2) Attachment 3 - Additional Provisions, Clauses, Terms and Conditions in Full Text Including Ordering Procedures</p>
<p>The SOW at paragraph F "Random, and injury, illness, or unhealthy practices collections will be conducted primarily at Government locations." Attachment 3 does not include the FAR Clause at 52.222-41, Service Contract Act of 1965, and we cannot find said clause anywhere else in the RFP.</p>
<p>Will contractor employees who perform work at "Government locations" be covered by the provisions of the Service Contract Act?</p>
<p>ANSWER: No</p>
<p>22. Who currently provides the following services to ICE and FPS:</p>
<p>d. Medical review officer services</p>
<p>ANSWER: Workcare, Inc. provides Medical review officer services. Also note that for preplacement drug screens, Mark Anderson, MD in Salt Lake City, UT is the MRO, and for random drug screens, the MRO is Barbara Pohlman, MD in Santa Ana, CA.</p>
<p><br />32. Reference: Synopsis of RFP on Federal Business Opportunity</p>
<p>The synopsis indicates that the Government anticipates awarding a single hybrid IDIQ contract as a result of this solicitation whereby Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Labor Hours (LH) task orders will be issued. Attachment 2 to the SOW, Schedule of Supplies, does not contain a schedule for the identification of labor classifications and rates to respond to the LH task orders.</p>
<p>Will this LH schedule be included upon award or does the government request that a schedule to address this to be included as part of our response to the solicitation?</p>
<p>ANSWER: The Government requests that offerors include this as part of their response to the solicitation (See SubCLINs 0006AA, 1006AA, 2006AA, 3006AA, 4006AA).</p>
<p>The total aggregate of all orders placed against this IDIQ contract will not exceed $60,000,000.00 over five (5) years.</p>
