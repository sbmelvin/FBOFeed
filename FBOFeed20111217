<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to include all questions and answers:<br /><br />1.
<p>As we are just hosting a standalone web site with almost no server side scripting then the questions end up being not applicable. But I included the answers below.</p>
<p>- Is this virtualized now or in any other instance? <br />Answer: Not virtualized. The current site which will be used as the model for this new site is on a standalone piece of hardware.</p>
<p>- If so hypervisor type and VM specs requested (e.g. VMWare, how many VMs? How many vCPUs, RAM, and how much VM storage?)<br />Answer: N/A</p>
<p>- What type of storage required? SATA assume, maybe Fiber Channel or Flash?<br />Answer: N/A</p>
<p>- They will manage the App? Configure envt etc? <br />a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What apps are being used?<br />Answer: N/A<br />b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What apps are being accessed?<br />Answer: N/A<br />&nbsp;<br />- What data is being used and where is it located now? Relates to Performance and latency demands<br />Answer: N/A</p>
<p>- can app run on RHEL 6.0 ok? <br />Answer: Yes</p>
<p>- running on a single LAN?<br />Answer: N/A</p>
<p>- internet based connectivity ok, through VPN? <br />Answer: Basic internet connectivity. Site visitors will not be using a VPN to reach the site.</p>
<p>- require continuous network access via site to site VPN?<br />Answer: N/A (see previous)</p>
<p>-require 2 factor authentication or other access controls for VM administration?<br />Answer: N/A (see above)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you currently have an EDU domain registration or will we need to reserve one<br />Answer: We do not have the .EDU yet.</p>
<p>* Do we need to host the server at our location or can we use cloud based servers<br />Answer: It can be hosted wherever as long as we are the only user on the system. Based on your question I have to assume this means at your location but that's not the requirement. Just that we are the only users on the system.</p>
<p>* Do we have statistics for the minimum traffic for the server<br />Answer: Minimum traffic would be zero users. Right now we expect this to be a standard information web presence for our accredited training facility.</p>
