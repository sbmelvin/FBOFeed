<SUBJECT>A -- Global Positioning System (GPS) Modernized User Equipment (MUE) Notice of Final RFP Release
<SOLNBR>FA8807-05-R-0005
<CONTACT>Donna Kimball, Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 363-6155, Email donna.kimball@losangeles.af.mil - Lt David Kindt, Buyer, Phone (310) 363-0194, Email david.kindt@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to inform potential vendors of the intent of the Global Positioning System (GPS) Modernized User Equipment (MUE) Receiver Card Development Program to release a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on or after 27 October 2005. The response date shall be specified upon release of the RFP.

Interested sources (primes or subcontractors) who have not previously responded should respond to this announcement.  Additionally, interested sources should request access to this information through the established website.  See paragraph entitled, “RFP ACCESS”.   

System Description: The MUE Program is the User Segment component of the GPS modernization effort.  The objective of the MUE Program is to demonstrate the “proof of existence” of MUE by demonstrating the ability to develop MUE receiver card designs, certify them under PRONAV, demonstrate their compliance with the MUE TRD, and ability to develop PVT data using the M-Code signal. To demonstrate this ability the MUE Program seeks to let contracts to design, develop, fabricate, and document two YMCA receiver cards and their required internal support components based on the GPS Receiver Applications Module SEM-E/Modernized (GRAM-S/M) and Ground-based GPS Receiver Applications Module - Modernized Small Serial Interface (GB-GRAM-M-SSI).  These requirements are available at the GPS website.  Instructions on how to access this website are presented at the end of this announcement.  The receiver cards will demonstrate the ability to receive and process the MUE signal as well as validate the Protection of Navigation (PRONAV) security architecture.  Support for demonstration of MUE receiver cards is covered under this effort.    

The MUE Receiver Program does not include production.  It is anticipated that MUE receiver card procurements will be conducted by platform managers for MUE specific to a platform or by the Services to meet Service-wide needs.
To assist respondents in understanding the potential scope of this effort the following program objectives are provided as reference:
  
1.	Design, develop, test, and document a YMCA compliant GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI, ensuring the receiver cards meet the requirements specified by the MUE TRD and other applicable requirements documents.   
2.	Implement a design for the receiver cards that optimizes performance, security, and safety, while allowing for the flexibility of the design to support emerging requirements/applications and minimizing the recurring costs of future YMCA receiver production.
3.	Deliver government approved consolidated MUE Receiver Card Test Plans and procedures for the integration, functional, software, and security testing of both receiver cards.
4.	Verify both receiver cards meet performance, environmental, security, and safety requirements, in accordance with Government-approved contractor MUE Receiver Card Test Plans, MUE Security Certification Plan and MUE TRD.
5.	Generate detailed specifications for each receiver card and its interfaces.
6.	Deliver complete documentation, data, and software for specifying the design, implementation, and production of the developed YMCA receiver cards including detailed information on the core components developed or selected for implementing the cards.
7.	Support Government testing of the GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI cards, in accordance with the Government test and evaluation strategy.
8.	Recommend modifications and enhancements to the GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI card requirements to ensure the implementation of common core receiver card components with the widest application.
9.	Recommend modifications to the GRAM Protection Profile and to the MUE Security Certification Plan, as well as other related specifications, ICDs, and ISs.
10.	Support demonstration of MUE receivers.
11.	Implement a Configuration Management Process as appropriate, consistent with Military Standard - Configuration Management 973.

Potential offerors must have the ability to process, maintain, and store collateral secret and special access required information.  

Contractual Issues: The MUE Receiver Card Development contract effort is anticipated to be a cost-plus award fee type contract with a period of performance of 48 months. 
It also includes special studies and support for the receiver demonstration on a cost-plus fixed fee basis.
RFP ACCESS: The Government intends to issue a final Request for Proposal for the MUE program on or after 17 October 2005.  All documentation regarding this effort can be obtained through the GPS Bidder’s Library.  Parties interested in accessing this information should apply at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary where they must provide adequate justification for access, all contact information, and a Government point of contact (Capt Daniel Vore, SMC/GPUM, 310-363-5885).  For contractual questions, please contact Donna Kimball at (310) 363-6155 or Lt David Kindt at (310) 363-0194.

PROGRAMMATICS: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition. The Ombudsman is the SMC Director of Staff, Col Robert Catlin.  The director of staff can be reached at 310-363-3571.

AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS: Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government’s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWARSYSCOM), on behalf of the Program Executive Office - Space Systems (PEO-SS), intends to award a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) sole source $3,000,000 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to: SBG Technology Solutions 2 Brittany Lane Stafford, VA 22554 Note 22 applies. FSC:  AC24. PEO Space Systems requires program management, and engineering, analytical and technical services support possessing experience with the MUOS Program, the Navy's ForceNet Program, the Global Information Grid, Open Architecture software/hardware issues and Operational Experience across traditional naval warfare and space domains to provide technical analysis, implementation collaboration and meeting liaison in support of PEO IWS, MUOS, ForceNet, Open Architecture, NESI, and Global Information Grid Navy- wide Enterprise Team initiatives.  The Space Open Architecture requirement surfaced as a result of the USD (AT&L) promulgated guidance memoranda concerning implementing Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA), directing the services to implement Open Architecture tenets. In response to this mandate, PEO IWS created the Open Architecture Enterprise Team (OAET) to oversee and facilitate OA implementation across PEO domains.  PEO Space Systems participates in the Open Architecture (OA) effort, the Netcentric Enterprise Solutions for Interoperability (NESI) effort, ForceNet Working Groups, Global Information Grid Working Groups, and the Geospatial Intelligence Working Group (GWG) to develop the technical architecture,  OA implementation guidance, OA technical criteria and reusable software components that can facilitate design, implementation and maintenance for information systems that support Network Centric Warfare (NCW) and contribute to the development of ForceNet capable systems for Space Systems.  These initiatives are further closely inter-related to ongoing ForceNet and GIG Navy/DoD initiatives. The Program Executive Officer for Space Systems is pursuing efforts sanctioned by PEO IWS to support functions and participation on numerous OA related working groups.  Extensive contractor program support will be required to augment PEO Space System's and PEO IWS's limited staff and accomplish these efforts within the aggressive schedule constraints that have been established by PEO IWS.  Technical support requirements will include program management, program support, systems engineering and integration analysis, acquisition management, contract management analysis, risk management, program scheduling and planning, contract planning, extensive briefing support, and the final development and staffing of requirements, specifications, planning documents,  program plans, and concept documents to support existing and future PEO IWS requirements as well as ongoing Open Architecture/ForceNet Risk Reduction Experimentation initiatives. Contractor support is also required to assist PEO Space Systems and PEO IWS in monitoring ongoing OA efforts at other agencies and organizations. Contractor support will include close liaison with the National Reconnaissance Office and PEO IWS. Personnel supporting this order should possess Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Clearances and cross operational experience across both naval and national space systems.  Contractors will be required to perform in U.S. Government SCIFs, although all work will be at the collateral level. A small percentage of the work may require the contractor to attend meetings at the SCI level and while working in U.S. Government SCIFs the contractor will be exposed to SCI data within day to day operations of the SCIFs.

The contractor will be responsible for providing all supervision, labor, equipment, material, travel and other items necessary to provide services in response to natural disasters, humanitarian efforts, and other requirements (i.e. due to non-performance by an incumbent contractor or instances where there is an unanticipated lapse in service.)  Due to the contingency nature of the services, the contractor will be required to provide any combination of work identified in the Navy Installation Management Accounting Project (IMAP) 2006 Core Business Model to include Command and Staff; Public Safety; Air Operations; Port Operations; Ordnance; Range Operations; Health Care Support; Supply; Personnel Support; Morale, Welfare and Recreation Support; Galley; Housing; Facilities Support; Utilities; Base Support Vehicles and Equipment; and Environmental.  Potential customers for this contract extend to other federal agencies outside the Department of Defense when authorized.

The contract period of performance is anticipated to consist of a 12-month base period and four (4) potential 12-month option periods.  The Government will not issue a synopsis when exercising the option(s).  This is a best value source selection procurement requiring both technical and price proposals.  Award of a contract shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, represents the best value to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  The offeror’s Financial/Accounting Management Systems will also be reviewed for compliance and adequacy.  The technical evaluation factors are as follows:  (A) Corporate Experience; (B) Past Performance; (C) Management and Technical Approach; and (D) Small Business Utilization.  The Government may award a contract without conducting discussions; therefore, the Offeror’s initial proposal shall contain its best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed necessary to obtain the best value for the Government.  The solicitation will be issued on or about 15 days from the date of this notice.  Proposals received from all responsible sources shall be considered.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued via the Internet at the NAVFAC E-Solicitation (E-Sol) website at http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil and can be downloaded free of charge.

NUWCDIVNPT plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in March or April 2006 for the procurement of TR-317 Transducer Assemblies. To allow prospective bidders the opportunity to begin planning for this procurement, NUWC will make the Specification and drawings available to eligible companies in January 2006. The drawings and specification can be obtained by emailing requests to Matthew F. Grzyb [grzymf@npt.nuwc.navy.mil].
The RFP will reflect a build to performance specification in accordance with NAVSEA Drawing No. 53711-5517024  ( Critical Item Product Specification for TR-317 Transducers). The CIPS, contains a classified appendix, and therefore a valid security clearance will be required. Two drawings packages (i.e.TR-317B Transducer and TR-317C Transducer) will be provided as part of the solicitation (upon request) for informational purposes only. The government does not warrant any of the data in the TR-317 production drawing package and a "build to print" approach may not constitute an adequate technical response. Drawings are restricted to distribution to US companies and can not be distributed to foreign countries without a proper export license.
It is expected that the solicitation will be issued under full and open competition.  The resulting contract is anticipated to be a 5 year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with Firm Fixed Priced provisions.  The Government plans to award the contract by September 2006. The potential value for the five year contract is approximately $20M (subject to budget changes).  The procurement plans for the five year contract, which are subject to budget changes, are as follows:  
Year 1:  50 First Article Transducers, 90 Production Transducers (subject to First Article approval), Level III Drawing Package, 
Technical Repair Standard.  Years 2:  1000 Production Transducers, and Year 3 thru 5:  1000 -2000 Production Transducers per Year.  The estimated delivery requirement for First Article transducers is 15 months after contract award. The Government anticipates that the contract will include a delivery incentive of $25K per month, for each full month that delivery exceeds the 15 month contractual requirement (up to a max of 3 months or $75,000.00).  This delivery incentive will only apply to First Article units.  Delivery requirements for subsequent production deliveries are 18 months after either First Article approval or 18 months after award of Delivery Order.  The CIPS for this transducer contains an extraneous noise requirement and the contractor will be required to develop and build a noise test facility to perform production lot noise testing. The costs of this facility will be separately priced.  NUWC will also make available to eligible companies an existing TR-317C transducer from Navy stock. The unit will be provided upon request.  Please email requests for existing TR-317C transducers to Matthew F. Grzyb [grzymf@npt.nuwc.navy.mil].  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.  We also provide electronic access in our Bid Room.

<DESC>The Bacteriology and Mycology Branch (BMB) of the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to recompete a requirement currently being performed by Focus Technologies, Inc. under NIAID Contract N01-AI-95359.  This procedure is being competed using full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541710.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period of performance beginning on or about February 16, 2007, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 1.35 FTEs.  The current NARSA contract established a repository of staphylococcal strains important to public health and research.  This repository of staphylococcal isolates with associated historical case information is available to researchers to use to the fullest potential to increase knowledge and affect prudent clinical management approaches for minimizing antimicrobial resistance.  NARSA also includes a website www.narsa.net and communication capacity to link basic scientists, epidemiologists, clinical microbiologists, and clinicians working in the area of staphylococcal diseases and antibiotic resistance, thereby encouraging collaborative research across disciplines of science, public health and medicine.  Other NARSA activities include strain characterization; establishment and maintenance of a registry of S. aureus case information; the evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods; establishment of a NARSA Scientific Working Group to provide guidance and oversight of NARSA activities; and coordination of annual investigator meetings which is open to any interested party. The NARSA network of investigators currently consists of 190 NARSA Affiliate Members (researchers approved to order NARSA strains) and 71 NARSA Core Members (researchers receiving NIAID grant/contract support to study S. aureus). At present, the NARSA repository maintains 216 strains, and ships approximately 100 samples monthly, with one-third shipped abroad.  Oracle databases store the information for the NARSA Strain Repository, the NARSA Case-History Registry, and NARSA membership information. At the time of the first contract, there was no systematic collection and distribution system for methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. NARSA has filled this gap and it is important to maintain and update this resource for the research community.  Researchers will continue to need ready and reliable access to well characterized isolates as well as an ability to easily communicate and interact with other researchers.  The original NARSA repository collected isolates of interest for S. aureus fully resistant to vancomycin (VRSA); however, in the contract to be awarded under this RFP, the repository will collect and distribute isolates of clinical, public health and research importance to antibiotic resistance in S. aureus.  The repository will also acquire and distribute other reagents which the Scientific Working Group deem helpful to the research community in advancing research on antibiotic resistant S. aureus. This RFP will be available electronically on/about February 7, 2006, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps and the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The following announcement is issued solely for Market Research purposes in planning for the 2010 Census Communications Campaign.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment to issue a Request for Proposal by the U.S. Census Bureau.  The Census Bureau is not accepting offers at this time nor will the information provided be evaluated or considered as an offer.  This Industry Day announcement does not commit the Census Bureau to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The Census Bureau is not responsible for any administrative cost incurred by a contractor in response to this announcement.  


BACKGROUND

Since 1790, as mandated by the U.S. Constitution in Article I, Section II, a head count of the population has been conducted once a decade for the purposes of reapportioning the U.S. Congress. The Census Bureau has been responsible since 1903 for conducting a complete enumeration of the resident population of the United States and its territories in an efficient and cost-effective manner. For Census 2000, some key challenges were to increase the mail response rate (it had been on the decline for two decades) and to improve the coverage of all population groups.  

The Census 2000 Partnership and Marketing Program (PMP), an initiative that combined promotion and marketing campaigns with an expanded outreach program, was implemented to reduce the declining response rate.

The Census 2000 program included four components:  a paid advertising campaign; community outreach (partnerships); promotions and special events; and media relations.  The direct mail package (questionnaire, advance letter, and reminder card) was also designed to increase self-response.  

2010 CENSUS COMMUNICATIONS CAMPAIGN

For the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau again intends to support decennial operations with a comprehensive, nationwide communications campaign designed to reach diverse audiences, which could include some or all of the components of the Census 2000 Communications Program (advertising, media relations, special events, among others).  The decennial census has been significantly re-engineered, including the implementation of the American Community Survey beginning in 2005. The 2010 Census will focus on counting all residents living in the United States and its territories.

It is anticipated that the communications contractor will develop, test, implement, monitor and maintain all program components covered by the contract for the period of time determined to be most appropriate for achieving the goals of the Census Bureau. 

WEB SITE

The official Web site for the 2010 Census Communications Campaign has been created and can be accessed at www.census.gov/procur/www/2010communications.  Industry representatives are encouraged to register on the Web site to receive updated information.  The Web site provides access to reference materials related to this project.  In particular, attention is directed to the “Evaluation of the Census 2000 Partnership and Marketing Program (PMP),” which can be found under the “Reference Library” link.  This document provides insight into the results from evaluations, experiments, and other assessments of the Census 2000 outreach effort, and makes recommendations for planning the 2010 Census Communications Campaign. 

This Web site also serves as the central point for interested parties to access information and to track the acquisition process for the 2010 Census Communications Campaign.   This site will be updated regularly.  

Should the Census Bureau decide to solicit proposals for this project, a draft RFP would be posted for comment on the Web site.  Due to the early stages of this process, no bidder list is currently being created nor maintained.

INDUSTRY DAY – February 17, 2006

The U.S. Census Bureau is currently in the Market Research / Industry Engagement stage for developing requirements for the national 2010 Census Communications Campaign.  As part of this process, the Census Bureau invites all members of the marketing, public relations and advertising community to participate in the 2010 Census Communications Campaign Industry Day to be held at the Department of Commerce Auditorium, (1401 Constitution Ave., N.W., Washington D.C.) on Friday, February 17, 2006 from 9:00 a.m. to noon.  This event will give interested vendors a glimpse of the campaign’s possible objectives.

The Census Bureau is holding this Industry Day to kick-off the acquisition process and market research with clear and open communication with the industry.  The Census Bureau is seeking input from public relations, advertising and communications-related agencies to obtain an understanding of current best practices in the industry regarding media usage, strategies, tactics, audience segmentation, acquisition process, evaluation, and contract administration, among others, in order to develop our acquisition strategy and plans. 

To register for this event, please access the Registration Form link found on the 2010 Communications website.  The last day for registration is Monday, February 13, 2006, at 4:00 PM EST.

Please note the entire presentation will be made available on the 2010 Communications Web site soon after the conference takes place.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.

The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>EXTENSION OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/ SOURCES SOUGHT (SS) NOTICE LIGHTWEIGHT TRANSPORTABLE SATCOM ANTENNA SYSTEM TO FEBRUARY 3RD 2006 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A SOLICITATION. The US Army Research, Development and Engineer ing Command (RDECOM), Communications Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Space and Terrestrial Communication Direct orate (S&TCD) is requesting information from companies that have design/development experience in antenna sys tems and/or power amplifiers for vehicle-mounted Satellite Communication (SATCOM) systems in the X, Ku, Ka and Q bands. The Government wishes to de termine potential sources for the development of an affordable, lightweight Comm-On-the-Halt (COTH) multiban d antenna system for tactical satellite communications.       INTRODUCTION: It is desired that next-generation multiband, transportable COTH antenna systems operate with an increased data rate, while being lighter in weight and potentially smaller than cur rently fielded systems.     Ease of use and setup are also highly     desired qualities.     This antenna system should be capable of transmitting and receiving via multiple commercial and military satellite systems, including the Wideband Gapfiller Satell ite (WGS), commercial Ku Band systems, XTAR, Advanced EHF (AEHF), and Tr ansformational Satellites (TSAT).     If easily accommodated, commercial Ka Band systems may also be of interest.     Simultaneous links to more than one satellite are not required.      The Government is requesting information from Industry to aid in determining the maturity of key technologies to meet these requirements.     It is understood that novel or alternative approaches to the problem may be needed to meet the desired object ives.     P ossible alternative approaches could include, but are not limited to:     shaped dual reflector systems for increased aperture efficiency, bifocal reflectors with two multiband feeds to eliminate manual feed changes, and the incorporation of an  additional agi le scan capability (either electronic or mechanical) with limited field of view to assist with antenna pointing.     This information will assist the Government in formulating an acquisition strategy and associated timeline for development of a future antenna     program.     The Government plans to start development of a multiband antenna system in FY07, with an OTM demonstration on Army representative vehicles in FY08 to validate a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 6.     Key areas of intere st for this antenna system in clude TWT (Traveling Wave Tube) amplifiers size/power and reliability.     SCOPE: The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to support a possible RFP release for a multiband COTH SATCOM TWT amplifiers, and to determine Industry interest in participating in this effort. The Government will use the information gathered in re sponse to this RFI to gain an understanding of potential approaches to meet COTH SATCOM TWT amplifier requirements. We seek to understand the current state of development that companies have achieved in TWT amplifier designs, as well as various alternative     innovative and creative solutions, and how these might apply to the Government effort to achieve a lightweight, affordable, efficient COTH antenn a system to potentially replace the HC3 COTH Phoenix. DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Key areas of interest for this antenna system and amplifiers include the following items.     Please address as many of the following as possible in your Information packag e:     1.        Statement of interest, either as a Prime- or a Sub-contractor/partner/team member.     2.

Weigh t estimates for antenna/positioner systems for 1.2m, 1.8m and 2.4m diameter antennas. 5.       Technologies or approaches for lightweight, large aperture (1.2-2.4m) antennas operating in a high wind environment. 6.       Feed technologies or approaches to mitigate setup complexity.     For reflector-based approaches, a minimum number of feeds are desired to cover the listed frequency bands.     Approaches that do not require manual changing of feeds are also desirable, as are     smaller, lightweight feeds.      For small feeds that may have wider beamwidth (~120 degree 10 dB beamwidth), comment of the feasibility of associated reflectors for this application. 7.       Applicability of the aforementioned technologies to a 2.4m X/Ka band transit-case terminal.  8.

<DESC>Potential Sources Sought.  The Coast Guard is seeking qualified sources that can perform the overhaul/repair of Pratt & WhitneyFT4A-G Marine Gas Generators.  NSN 2835-01-273-7715-FT4A-2, 2835-01-326-7758-FT4A-6, 2835-01-227-1709-FT4A-12, and 2835-01-F93-0369-GG4A3, Marine Gas Generators Overhaul/Repair.  This will be a requirements type contract with one (1) base year and four (4) option years.  The Wood Group Pratt & Whitney FT4A Marine Gas Generators are utilized on the 378’ high endurance cutter and 400’ ice breakers.  This requirement will also include:  (1) the overhaul/repair of marine gas generator modules A thru F; (2) provisions for an OEM technical representative to be present during the critical phases of the overhaul/repair; (3) OEM technical representative sources for installation of a gas generator and (4) the use of Woodward Governor Company for the overhaul of the fuel control and speed monitoring system.  This will be full and open competition using OEM Wood Group Pratt & Whitney Industrial Services parts only, OEM technical representatives and Woodward Governor.  The work shall be performed in accordance with Pratt & Whitney/Turbo Power and Marine Systems, Inc., specifications, standards and recommended procedures for Marine Gas Generators identified as (1) CG4 Industrial Overhaul Manual, P/N 544026 as applicable for Marine Gas Generator, dated 10/15/91 including FT4A-2 Gas Generator Test Plan T234-0348 Rev 1 and T234-0347 Rev. 1; (2) Turbojet Engine Overhaul Standard Practice Manual P/N 585005 dated 11/15/99; (3) Pratt & Whitney Service Bulletins and Woodward Governor Company specifications and procedures.  The contractor shall utilize the Coast Guard test plan 2630-338 (2, 3, 6) and 2630-339 (12).  All parts to be furnished and used with the overhaul(s) shall be (OEM) Wood Group Pratt & Whitney Industrial Service and Woodward Governor Company Parts.  Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to Wood Group Pratt & Whitney Industrial Services parts/services and Woodward Governor are not available to the Government and are propriety to the OEMs.  Accordingly, it is believe that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center from obtaining competition (for parts, technical services only and overhaul of the fuel control and speed monitoring system by Woodward Governor) as they are available from this source.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to supply the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The procurement involves parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacturer or its actual supplier.  Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the items are invited to submit complete information discussion such capabilities as follows:  (i.e. salient physical functional and serviceability characteristics) (1) show that they satisfactorily manufactured the parts for the Government or the prime equipment manufacturer; or (2) submit complete and current engineering data comparing the offered parts to the OEM to demonstrate the acceptability of the parts.  It is the Government’s belief that only Wood Group Pratt & Whitney Industrial Services, the manufacturer of the gas generator engines and Woodward Governor and/or its dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure the proper fit, form and function of all its components.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing capabilities in duplicate within fifteen (15) days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing information is required.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to pay for this information solicited.  Responses must be concise and be specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above.  Concerns that respond to the notice must fully demonstrate their capabilities to meet the requirements.  Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capabilities should be sent to the attention of  Sharon Jackson, Contract Specialist (CODE 045/54).  See number notes 22, and 26*****

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to obtain three (3) Conductivity Temperature and Depth (CTD) Sensors: To be considered interested parties must be able to demonstrate their ability to provide the oceanographic equipment that meets the following specification: The minimum functional requirements for this instrument are as follows:
Salinity being a derivative of the temperature and conductivity of sea water, our coral reef monitoring requires a Conductivity precision factor greater than or equal to 0.0003 S/m accuracy with a 0.00001 S/m resolution. The Temperature must also have 0.002 0C accuracy with a 0.0001 resolution. The ICON (Integrated Coral Observing Network) Project already solely incorporates Falmouth Scientific (FSI) NXIC Series CTD’s.  Therefore new units must be able to directly plug into and operate with our existing hardware and software. The hardware aspect relates to the special fish bite proof cable manufactured by Cortland Cable. This cable has to have a larger than usual connector and all of our underwater and surface instruments have this bulkhead connector installed. The current software in use is FSI CTD Pro.  Due to the mounting specifications for the CTD the project requires instruments that do not suffer from proximity effects and are able to be cleaned by divers without affecting factory calibration.  The CTD must incorporate passive antifouling controls that are not detrimental to the marine environment.  The CTD must also be able to accept 4, 0-5V and 1 RS 232 ancillary sensors, internal memory storage and internal battery pack. The CTD sensor must record the conductivity, temperature and depth internally while simultaneously up loading the data via the RS-232 interface to our data logger, which transmits the data hourly via Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) satellite. If any problems arise and transmission to the GOES satellite stops or the external power drops below 12vdc, no conductivity, temperature or depth data is lost. Associated computer and software must provide easy method development, quality assurance and control and data formats that easily import into our laboratory information management system. Specific Technical Specifications include:Conductivity: Range 0 to 70 mS/cm, Accuracy 0.003 mS/cm, Resolution 0.0001 S/cm,Temperature: –5 to +350C, Accuracy 0.002, Resolution 0.0001,Depth: 0 to 20 meter Full Scale, Accuracy 0.1% of Full Scale, Resolution 0.002%, Full Scale, Non External Inductive Conductivity Cell free from proximity effects, Memory: 2048k Byte non-volatile FLASH memory, Data Storage: Conductivity, Temperature, Depth and Time = to 185,000 samples, Real-Time Clock: Accuracy ± 2.6 minutes/year,4 0-5V analog, and 1 RS 232 ancillary input,Internal Battery backup: 80,000 samples (incase of solar power failure) 7.2ahr Alkaline battery pack, which can be, shipped separate from instrument without hazardous material restrictions, External Input Power: 40ma @ 9 to 24vdc,Passive, non TBT based antifouling controls, with diver cleanable conductivity cells, The system must include a one-year warranty, parts, labor and travel. All computer hardware and software must be better or equal the current software in use. To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide the supply and satisfy the Government’s needs. Along with descriptive literature to support the equipment being offered. Such information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for whom you have furnished this supply previously, and detailed narrative that describs your facility and ability to provide the sensor that will meet the requirements described herein. This notice is for a supply for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties must respond within (10) days after publication of this notice. If no affirmative responses are received, the government intends to issue a purchase order to Falmouth Scientific, Inc. Faxed information can be sent to 816-294-6993, Attn: Sharon Walker. The Central Region Administrative Division (CRAD), requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).

<DESC>The Air Force Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB) is exploring information on combat certified fuel tanks that can be used on the A/OA-10.  This technology would be used by all A/OA-10s for combat and/or training missions.  The A/OA-10 does not have an external fuel tank certified for combat operations.  Current operations in the AOR require air refueling to support our warfighters on the ground.  This puts a strain on an already over-tasked tanker fleet.

The tanks will be used by the A/OA-10 in all types of operations at home station as well as deployed operations.  Multiple uses of the fuel tanks are envisioned.  The tanks will increase combat range and loiter time and reduce the dependence of tanker support to accomplish the A/OA-10 combat missions.  The desired functional characteristics are as follows:

1.  The tanks can be 300 to 600 gallon capacity.  
2.  They must be compatible with current fuel tank loading ground equipment.
3.  They will be capable of being loaded on the centerline station (station 6) without interfering with weapons or stores loaded on stations 5&7.
4.  The tanks will be stressed for up to 475 Knots Indicated Airspeed and +7.3/-3.0 Gs symmetric, and +5.8/-1.0 Gs rolling.
5.  They must be able to be safely jettisoned if aircraft safety/survival is compromised.
6.  They must be able to operate in low and high altitude A/OA-10 combat operations.
7.  The tanks will not interfere with the 30mm Ammunition Loading System of the GAU-8 cannon.

Through this request for information (RFI), the Battlelab is requesting information concerning mature or readily emerging technologies that meet the requirements previously stated.  This RFI may be followed by a request for proposal to conduct a Battlelab Concept Demonstration.  All possible offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.

<DESC>F-15 COVERT INTER-COCKPIT SIGNALING DEVICE
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available covert lighting systems.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct a study that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:  

United States Air Force requires F-15 covert lighting designed to be visible to night vision goggles (NVGs) in multi-ship formation.  A long-range solution has been identified employing modified wingtip lights.  Intent here is an inexpensive, short-range solution that could be employed by end CY06.  Companies interested in a copy of the long-range solution should contact Major Cathy Blacklock at cathy.blacklock@mountainhome.af.mil.

The AWB is interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be used as-is or slightly modified to solve this problem.

The below attributes are either mandatory or desired requirements.  (For purposes of this request, the aircraft displaying the lighting will be called the “wingman” while the aircraft looking at the “wingman” will be called “flight lead.”  The solution to this requirement will be called the “device.”):

1.  The device should be water resistant.
2.  The device should be shock resistant.
3.  The device might be carried to the cockpit by the aircrew and removed after flight.  If so, the device could be rechargeable and/or have extended battery life.
4.  The device might be fixed in / on the aircraft.  
5.  In a formation of more than two aircraft, the device must enable flight lead to determine which of the wingmen is being observed.  It follows that each of the wingmen must be able to identify if they are looking at flight lead or one of the other wingmen.  In the event a wingman changes his/her position (for example, from “Eagle 3” to “Eagle 2”) in the flight, the device should be re-programmable in-flight (on the ground may be an acceptable alternative) to communicate to flight lead the new position.
6.  The device must be bright enough to be visible to an NVG-equipped wingman at a minimum of 5 nautical miles, with visibility at 10 or more miles desired.  Visibility from all aspects is desired; special consideration will be given to devices with visibility from side aspects (plus or minus 45 degrees of line abreast and plus or minus 20 degrees of level).
7.  Regarding the possibility of interference with the night vision goggles of the aircrew of the aircraft carrying the device: The device will have no gain down, glare or blooming effects in the aircrew’s NVGs when they are looking forward of the 3-9 line.  When looking beyond the 3-9 line, there will be minimal gain down and glare in the NVGs.  Intent is to maximize visual lookout and minimize aircrew distraction every time the device flashes.
8.  The device could be capable of being switched on / off while in flight.
9.  The device may be uniquely designed for F-15 MSIP with a separate unique design for F-15E aircraft.  
10.  Ease of use is paramount.

The AWB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives:

1.	The manufacturer’s suggested retail price and/or a schedule of lease pricing for the commercial product.
2.	The names of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3.	The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the above attributes.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 15 Feb 06 to Major Cathy Blacklock, Air Warfare Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648 or Email cathy.blacklock@mountainhome.af.mil.  Major Blacklock can be reached at (208) 828-3542.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>This sources sought is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S Government.  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published.  No award will be made as a result of this market research.  This inquiry shall serve as an opportunity for Contractors to evidence their capabilities of providing armored panels to the specifications outlined below in an expedited timeframe for fleet deployment.  Qualifications shall be based upon information that indicates Contractors who possess an existing capability for the fabrication and production of composite armored panels.  Claims of existing technologies must be substantiated with test data.

The USMC H-1 helicopter program, PMA-276, is seeking information from all sources to provide integrated composite armored panels and engineering services supporting installation of integrated ballistic panels on the AH-1W and other helicopters.  The armor panel shall be capable of at least a V50 ballistic limit of  2,600 feet-per-second against 7.62x39mm projectiles (both ball and API) and 2,900 feet-per-second against 7.62x54mm projectiles (both ball and API).  Areal densities for armored panels should not exceed six pounds per square foot.  In addition, the integrated armored panels must be capable of being formed into curvatures that conform to existing aircraft panels.  The integrated panels shall be designed to replace existing, unarmored panels.   On site battle damage repair capabilities for the integrated armor panels are desired.  Due to proximity of dynamic components minimal deflection of backing material is required.  All replacement integrated armor panels must be capable of withstanding normal operating environments for H-1 aircraft.

NAVAIR requests that companies respond by submitting 1) a summary outline of the performance specification of the proposed composite panels, 2) a Capability Statement indicating the current production capabilities, and 3) Test data to substantiate capabilities and any other information as determined by the vendor, limited to 20 printed pages.  Additionally, respondents may provide contract numbers and descriptions, for similar type work and products, as evidence of production capabilities.

Written and/or electronic media responses to this announcement must be received no later than 20 February 2006 and can be submitted to:

<CONTACT>Kelly Gorman, Contract Specialist, (973)724-2164
<DESC>The 40mm NL Ammunition Engineering branch at Picatinnyâ€™s Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center is investigating the use of pressure mapping  technology to assess the non-lethality of 40mm NL projectiles.  This  investigation consists of shooting a NL projectile into the sensor surface that  is backed with a soft resilient material and obtaining pressure vs. time and  area vs. time maps in a digital output format.  The sensor will be able to  survive repeated low velocity impacts, operate in temperature extremes, and  high humidity environments.  The impacts will range in magnitude from 0 â€“ 1000  psi and possibly higher.  The sensor must be capable of obtaining pressure data  with an accuracy of plus/minus 1 psi.  Respondents must be capable of providing  the sensor and training in the proper use of the sensor and any associated  software programs.  This market survey is intended to find suitable technology  to replace the clay block test (NIJ-STD 0101.04) in the evaluation and  qualification of the M1006 non-lethal munition.  The testing technology will  eventually be used with the M1012, M1013 and M1029 rounds as well.  This sensor  will be used to evaluate the performance of kinetic energy non-lethal rounds in  development as well. Interested parties that believe they can meet the above requirements shall  provide the U.S. Army a description of their capabilities, including a brief  summary of their companyâ€™s capabilities in R&D, manufacturing, and testing.  Reponses should identify their current business structures: (a) Name of companyâ€” includes contact personâ€™s name, company address, telephone numbers (voice and  fax), e-mail address. (b) Company size (i.e., Large, Foreign, Small, Small  Disadvantaged, 8(a), Woman-Owned Small Business, or Service Disabled Small  Business).   Firms interested in this acquisition should adequately describe  their experience in pressure mapping technology.  Point of contact for this action is Kelly Gorman, Contract Specialist, US TACOM  Picatinny, ATTN: AMSTA-AQ-APA, BUILDING 10, PICATINNY ARSENAL, NJ. 07806-5000  or at kgorman@pica.army.mil.

<DESC>Enhanced Portable Inductive Artillery Fuze Setter (EPIAFS) production contract.  ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, is seeking qualified sources  for a 24-36 month production, build to print effort beginning in 4QFY06  for the EPIAFS.  The EPIAFS system will be capable of setting the XM982 Excalibur projectiles and all NATO standard inductive fuzes. The EPIAFS  system consists of three electronic components: A Platform Integration  Kit (PIK), a handheld Setter, and a setter to gun Cable.  The PIK is  a gun-mounted data processor that sends and manages the data stream  from multiple interfaces. The setter is a handheld device which  inductively couples data and power to either the Excalibur projectile  or applicable fuzes.  When used alone, the Setter must replicate the functionality of the M1155 PIAFS.  When connected with the Cable to  an automated fire control system, such as the Light Weight (LW) 155  Towed Artillery Digitization System (TADS) or the M109A6 Paladin  Digital Fire Control System, the EPIAFS can receive and inductively  supply a stream of data, power, and timing pulses to initialize a  precision guided GPS projectile such as Excalibur.  Excalibur is a  GPS Precision Guided Munition which requires power and Gun, Target,  Fuze, and GPS data to be sent over an inductive interface to initialize  the projectile.       Acceptance test of EPIAFS shall include: 1.  100% of EPIAFS at hot, cold, and ambient temperatures. 2.  Shock, vibration, immersion, humidity, salt/fog, and 5 foot drop  testing will be done on a sample basis (sample size TBD). The Contractor will be required to test the three components as system.

<SUBJECT>D -- Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration 2006 (CWID2006)
<DESC>1. This Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) announcement is for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration 2006 (CWID 2006), scheduled for 30 May through 23 June 2006.  Combatant Commands, Services and Department of Defense (DoD) Agencies (C/S/As), government agencies outside the DoD, and international participants must submit interoperability trial proposals for CWID 2006 by 30 September 2005.  Industry partners must work through a C/S/A or government agency sponsor from outside the DoD to submit trials. Complete details on CWID 2006, to include the format and submission instructions for interoperability trials (ITs), can be found at http://www.cwid.js.mil. 

2. CWID is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's annual event that enables the C/S/As and the international community to investigate command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) solutions that focus on relevant and timely objectives for enhancing coalition interoperability.  US Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), is responsible for the oversight of the CWID event.  The intent of CWID is to conduct ITs that include C4ISR technologies that are capable of being responsibly placed into an operational environment within 6-12 months following the execution phase. ITs are not limited to hardware and/or software solution assessments. The tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with using technologies are just as important as the IT solutions themselves.  Further investigation into these areas using CWID as a vehicle is highly encouraged. The USJFCOM Staff will review and consider the results of the CWID event in an effort to identify those solutions that could be responsibly fielded or endorsed to the Joint Staff J6 for referral to an existing program of record.

3. United States European Command (USEUCOM) is the host Combatant Command (COCOM) for CWID 2006.  Consequently, the scenario for CWID 2006 will reflect a more traditional military-to-military and military-to-civil authority focus on exercising its Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) responsibilities in an international setting.  United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) intends to continue its CWID transformational efforts by investigating systems integration and interoperability solutions in the Home Land Security/Home Land Defense (HLS/HLD) arena. 

USEUCOM intends to use CWID as a risk reduction venue and proving ground for emerging C4ISR technologies relevant to the GWOT.  Coalition participation and the demonstration of interoperable C4ISR systems remains the cornerstone of CWID.  Anticipated international participants will include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and NATO to include several constituent nations.  In coordination with, and the approval of, the Joint Staff J-6, each COCOM may sponsor and invite individual nations from within their respective area of- responsibility to participate as multinational task force (MTF) members. 

4. CWID is conducted in a simulated operational environment to provide a context for validation of C4ISR solutions.  Depending on the capabilities to be demonstrated during CWID Execution, each IT may receive one or more of the following assessments: Warfighter/Operator, Technical/ Interoperability, Security Capabilities assessment, and a Fielding/Sustainability Assessment.  The Systems Engineering and Integration Working Group (SEIWG), with input from other working groups, will report on those trials, which are not formally assessed by the Assessment Working Group (AWG).  Results from all trials will be detailed in the CWID Final Report.  ITs with coalition partners are conducted over a worldwide secure network, Combined Federated Battle Laboratories Network (CFBLNet) enabling trials classified SECRET releasable to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and NATO.  The use of other information domains to support diverse communities of interest and their information flow requirements is influenced by the participating nations and government agencies and approved by the CWID Senior Management Group.  

5. To be considered for participation in CWID 2006, each proposed IT must:  address one or more of the CWID 2006 objectives listed in paragraph 7, commit to fully resource the trial (funding, personnel, training, hardware, software, documentation, etc.) for one or more execution locations, be submitted in concert with a DoD sponsor or with a government sponsor from outside the DoD in the format outlined on the CWID web site. 

6.  The CWID Senior Management Group (SMG), in concert with coalition partners, will select specific IT proposals for execution by 7 November 2005 based on projected availability of resources, how well the IT satisfies one or more of the CWID objectives, and additional considerations as specified on the CWID web site.  USEUCOM will provide an initial determination on those ITs related to the GWOT. 

7. USJFCOM, in coordination with the Joint Staff, DISA, NSA, JITC, the Services and USEUCOM, gathered and prioritized objectives for CWID 2006 from the COCOM capability gaps highlighted in their collective integrated priority lists.  A summary of the five specific CWID 2006 objectives follows:

CWID 2006 Overarching Objectives and Explanations

Overview:      

The event objectives, form the foundation for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (CWID), and are driven by the overarching need to share and exchange information between military organizations, international coalitions and civilian agencies.  The traditional view of coalitions focused on military-to-military interaction; however, it now incorporates a variety of international organizations that include military and civilian agencies.  The Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) has highlighted the continuing need for unimpeded information sharing between legacy and new technologies as well as tactical exchanges between emerging coalition partners, civilian agencies and civil authorities/first responders.  By streamlining command and control capabilities, we improve our senior leadership’s ability to respond to GWOT contingencies.  The multi-national and interagency requirements for information sharing are, in many cases, more complex than those of traditional military-to-military coalition partners because of a lack of common standards and protocols for both hardware and software.  

Coalition operations, in response to international crises, continue to highlight the requirement to seamlessly exchange command, control, computer, communication, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) and logistical information.  The acceptance and endorsement of the Network Centric Warfare concept by the U.S. and the nations within the various coalitions participating in current operations, points to the need to resolve the associated technical, procedural and policy challenges. 

The CWID event provides a unique opportunity for U.S. Combatant Commanders, Homeland Security/Homeland Defense (HLS/HLD) organizations and traditional international coalitions to explore innovative information sharing and interoperability solutions.  CWID 2006 continues this successful tradition by providing a venue aimed at thoroughly integrating solutions while focusing on network centricity, and investigating tactics, techniques and procedures. 
The CWID hardware and software demonstrations support the overall Network Centric Warfare construct and leverage the advantages of emerging technology.  During the CWID execution phase, Interoperability Trial (IT) activities will be conducted over, or connected to, a world wide area network that supports military and coalition operations while providing the infrastructure to facilitate the military’s role in providing Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA).  CWID ITs are executed within the context of an overarching scenario to demonstrate how coalition warfighting and civil interagency operations can benefit from emerging technologies.
The CWID 2006 Objectives described below contain several key differences from those associated with past Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstrations.  First, the number of objectives has been reduced to narrow the focus of the annual event and to reflect a recurring theme of “Coalition Information Sharing.”  Second, each objective is supported by “sub-objectives” that reference clearly defined U.S. Combatant Commander and Coalition capability gaps.  Finally, each “sub-objective” is related to the Universal Joint Task List (UJTL) to highlight a stronger relationship with warfighter requirements through a more defined mission-to-task linkage (specific UJTL references available upon request).  These process improvements facilitate post-CWID execution efforts to develop strategies aimed at responsibly bringing solutions to the warfighters.

Objective 1: Coalition Command & Control (C2).  Enhance the Commander’s Coalition C2 capability through secure, scalable and bandwidth sensitive technologies, within and between communities of interest (COIs) and information domains of differing security classifications.  

-	create a cohesive C2 relationship with and between military, coalition 
      and non-military activities        
-    improve open and secure mobile C2 capabilities between COIs 
-    streamline operational decision-making for GWOT contingencies 
Explanation: Coalition operations require an information environment that spans multiple COIs.  These COIs may be mobile, fixed or remotely located where the combination of military and/or civil agencies is likely to be affected by limited bandwidth.  Within any COI, mission success relates to the commander’s C2 ability to communicate directly with individual users who may be detached from fixed information domains.  Decision makers and/or first responders require interoperable, reliable and/or secure wireless capabilities to receive and transmit critical voice, data, and video information to support the Network Centric warfare construct.  Solutions to achieve improved C2 between diverse COIs should consider the use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations, or propose new approaches that are well on their way to gaining security certification for operational use.  

Objective 2: Coalition Information Sharing.  Provide solutions that improve the Commander’s ability to share information within a multi-lingual coalition that is secure, scalable and bandwidth sensitive.   Included in this objective are improvements to language translation tools that provide grammatically correct, militarily appropriate context, multi-language translations to support verbal and textual collaboration within and between disparate information domains.  

-     multi-level and multi-domain security 
-	improve utility, accuracy and language capacity of translation tools 
      (French, Spanish, Italian, Arabic and Russian) 
o	written-to-voice, visa versa
o	voice-to-voice 
o	user friendly displays 
Explanation: Coalition information sharing is more than providing a common operational picture at the strategic or major echelon level of command.  It must be secure, scaleable in scope and functional within the theater bandwidth available at all levels of warfare.  Trial proposals should be capable of using existing interface standards and protocols that define the format, content, and exchange mechanisms for shared data.  Solutions must support each nation’s disclosure and release policies as well as provide a secure means of consistently communicating accurate information in a multi-lingual military and/or local authority context.  Possible information to exchange includes: directive commentary, friendly and hostile order of battle, targeting information, safe areas for marshalling, weather data, imagery, Global Information Services (GIS) map data, equipment status, personnel movements and other intelligence related products.   A key subset to creating and sustaining a coalition information-sharing environment is that users must be able to consistently and securely access, extract and utilize common information derived from dissimilar databases across multiple domains.  Further, coalition operations are routinely conducted with multiple nations and organizations that are challenged with using a common language.  A tool to translate documents, displays, and written/audio-exchanges between planners and end-users, is a requirement of operations at the military, agency, and other government organization levels.  Current translation tools include inadequate vocabularies for limited languages and typically do not provide grammatically correct or militarily relevant translations.  Additionally, no translation tool currently provides for the simultaneous translation of a single language to multiple languages. Inherent in this requirement is the need to fuse dissimilar information and extract specific data sets while providing reliable language translations for communicating guidance to coalition partners. 

Objective 3:  Integrated Logistics.  Provide solutions for responsive, effective logistics within and between multiple information communities of interest (COIs).
- 	develop the ability to assess and display information on the movement, location and status of US and coalition partners’ equipment and personnel en route and/or deployed 
-	improve logistics data access, fusion and integration among COIs 

Explanation:  Within the information environment of a coalition, military and non-military operations, the commander must have responsive and effective logistics.  Logistic data is contained within diverse logistics information systems maintained by the military and civilian agencies across the coalition.  Access to that data implies combining total asset visibility and information during the transit of friendly forces into a single information presentation available across multiple information COIs.  Solutions should address the locating and fusion of logistics information feeds as part of the commander’s general situation awareness.  Solutions to achieve CWID objectives should consider the use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations or propose new approaches that are relatively mature in gaining security certification for operational use.

Objective 4: Continuity of Operations.  Provide C2 solutions that enhance the Commander’s ability to plan, communicate and affect coalition operations while remotely deployed.   Inherent in this objective is the ability of the commander to maintain situational awareness and connectivity with subordinate activities while en route to the theater in crisis. 

-	enhance Commander’s ability to rapidly deploy a joint force     
      headquarters 

Explanation: Commanders are challenged to sustain their situational awareness once they depart on their assigned mission.  Trial proposals must be capable of using existing interface standards and protocols that define the format, content, and exchange mechanisms for shared data.  Possible information requirements include: friendly and hostile order of battle, targeting information, safe areas for marshalling, weather data, imagery, Global Information Services (GIS) map data, equipment status, personnel movements and other intelligence-related information.  When appropriate, the solution must be scaleable to provide GIS and Global Command and Control System (GCCS) situational awareness information to non-military, federal, state and local participants via a protected, multi-lingual and secure network, common to all.  Information exchange should support pre-event and en route planning as well as the situational awareness during the execution of operations.  At a higher level, this objective involves effective information dissemination and knowledge management.  This includes problems of integration, or conversion of data from one format to another, identification of producers/ consumers of information, and how to transmit the information securely from end-to-end while supporting national disclosure/release policy.  A key subset to creating and sustaining effective situational awareness is users must be able to consistently and securely access, extract and utilize common information derived from dissimilar databases across multiple domains, while operating within a bandwidth-constrained architecture.  Additionally, the integrity and continuity of sharing common information across networks must be preserved.  Potential trials need to explore web technology, improved data labeling, data standardization and / or enhancements to existing solutions while being realistically acceptable to security management concerns.  Where applicable to information sharing, data encryption must be accomplished at the lowest level.

Objective5: Net Centric Enterprise Services.  Provide solutions that enhance the Commander’s ability to collaborate and disseminate information among communities of interest (COIs) in a Net Centric environment.  

-	improve information assurance
-	improve horizontal data access, fusion and integration 
-	improve vertical and horizontal information distribution

Explanation:  Network Centric Enterprise Services imply that coalition, military and non-military civilian authorities can harness the power of their respective information environments to collaboratively plan and execute operations even in a bandwidth-constrained environment.  Collaborative planning and dissemination of products in a bandwidth constrained environment horizontally across and vertically within COIs is an emerging issue for the warfighter, particularly as software and procedure tools become sufficiently robust to be extended from the operational to the tactical level of warfare.  Operations require an information environment that is not only scaleable, but one that spans multiple COIs.  These COIs may be populated and maintained by military or civil agencies or a combination of both and it is likely they will be bandwidth-constrained. The information exchange between these COIs must be accomplished in such a way that it inspires confidence at each activity that the information is being disseminated securely, and will only be available to the agreed upon and authorized participants.  Solutions to achieve this data dissemination, across and within COIs, should consider the use of existing, approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations, or propose new approaches that are well on their way to gaining security certification for operational use.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

(2) Be filed with the Contracting Officer.

(3) State whether the protestor chooses to have the Contracting Officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the protest is silent on this matter, the Contracting Officer will decide the protest.

(f) Oral conferences may take place either by telephone or in person. Other parties may attend at the discretion of the deciding official.

WRITTEN JUSTIFICATION FOR A SPECIFIC MAKE OR MODEL
The agency’s need for the Drug Abuse Treatment Protocol Journals listed above can only be provided by one source (The Change Companies).  To obtain similar journals from another vendor would require the re-development of the Drug Abuse Treatment Protocol, which would not be economically feasible and would not provide timely delivery.  The Change Companies designed and developed the Drug Abuse Treat Protocol Journals.  The journals are copyrighted and may not be reproduced or utilized in any form or by any means, electronic or mechanical, including photocopying, without written permission from The Change Companies.  The BOP now has a requirement to receive these journals and The Change Companies is the only available source who can fulfill the BOP’s requirement.

<DESC>[To request a copy of this Request for Proposal (RFP), please contact Ms. Jennifer Thomas, 301-228-4004, thomasj@ncifcrf.gov.]

The National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics (NCICB) is seeking professional service expert(s) to work independently as well as directly with the NCICB project teams on the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG).  These experts must have had previous experience in: grid computing, n-tier architecture design developing highly interactive end user applications; software and data model design; and robust software development methodology that optimizes for high quality deliverables.  The contractor will include test plan development, software quality assurance procedures, and professional project management activities in its planning and execution. 

The goal of this project will be to demonstrate the usefulness of caGrid infrastructure as a platform to perform scientifically challenging investigations involving integration of data and analytical services from diverse research communities.  The caGrid client will enable individual users to work on common platforms to access caGrid resources in real time from common data and analytical services. The client will have various configurations that support end users in the cancer biomedical research community.

This application will ensure that all can access caGrid and serve as a platform for further development and innovation in the caBIG community.

Background:

The cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid, or caBIG, is a voluntary network or grid connecting individuals and institutions to enable the sharing of data and tools, creating a World Wide Web of cancer research (https://cabig.nci.nih.gov). The goal is to speed the delivery of innovative approaches for the prevention and treatment of cancer. The approach is to leverage existing technologies for the standardization of data representation and semantics coupled with common data integration architecture. 

As part of this effort, NCICB has developed and deployed a prototype grid caGrid  (https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/workspaces/Architecture/caGrid/) that enables the building of an open, multi-institutional data sharing, annotation, and analysis environment. 

caBIG “Silver” compliant systems (https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/guidelines_documentation) can become “grid enabled” by registering and plugging onto the caGrid infrastructure. When the system is generated using the caCORE SDK (http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/SDK), no additional code is required to expose the data service on the grid. 

caGrid has service registry that supports advertisement and discovery of services based on common metadata. The services registered on the caGrid can be queried using a caBIG XML Query Language. Invocation of analytical service deployed on the grid is also available on the caGrid.  caGrid specifies common interfaces and syntax requirements for registering and using grid services securely. It has tools to allow easy installation and deployment of Globus (http://www.globus.org/toolkit/), Open Grid Services Architecture-Data Access and Integration (OGSA-DAI), and Mobius Global Model Exchange services (http://projectmobius.osu.edu/overview.php). There is a web based user interface and thick client interface provided as part of caGrid to demonstrate the client APIs for accessing the grid services (http://cagrid-browser.nci.nih.gov/cagrid-browser/). caGrid leverages caCORE to provide the necessary semantic typing, modeling and metadata structures that define and constrain the contents of services in caGrid. 

The caGrid client demonstration project will leverage the caGrid infrastructure to support key caBIG program needs.

Combined Solicitation/Synopsis is revised/amended to clarify evaluation proceures IAW Federal Acquisition Regulations.  Delete previously stated evaluation criteria and replace with the following.

Evaluation of Offers.  The Government will award an order resulting from this Request for Proposal to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the Statement of Work as referenced within this Combined synopsis/solicitation using the following evaluation procedures.  

FAR 13.106-2 states the contracting officer has broad discretion in fashioning suitable evaluation procedures.  The procedures prescribed in FAR parts 14 and 15 are not mandatory.  At the contracting officer’s discretion, one or more, but not necessarily all of the evaluation procedures in part 14 or 15 may be used.  If using price and other factors, ensure offers can be evaluated in an efficient and minimally burdensome fashion.  Formal evaluation plans and establishing a competitive range, conducting discussions and scoring offers are not required.  Contracting officers may conduct comparative analysis of offers.  Evaluation of other factors such as past performance does not require the creation or existence of a formal database; and may be based on information such as the contracting officer’s knowledge of and previous experience with the service being acquired, customer surveys, or other reasonable basis.  Offers will be evaluated for best value using a trade off process IAW FAR 15.101-1 procedures.  This process permits tradeoffs among price and non-price factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal when perceived benefits of the higher priced proposal merit the additional price.

Evaluation factors: Technical Acceptability, Past Performance and Price.  

Order of importance of evaluation factors:  The non-price evaluation factors, Technical Acceptability and Past Performance, are equal in importance and when combined are approximately equal to the price evaluation factor.

Technical Acceptability requirements:  proposal demonstrates the offerors ability to conform to solicitation requirements as referenced within this Combined synopsis/solicitation.

Past performance evaluation will be conducted IAW FAR 13.106-2 as referenced above.  Emphasis will be placed on customer satisfaction on quality of service provided and ability to meet schedule.  Recent and relevant present and past performance will be evaluated.  Recent is performance within 2 years of this proposal due date.  Relevant is similar breadth/complexity of training services.  A higher relevancy will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to this effort.

Proposal response/due date is extended two days from Jan 23, 2006 to Jan 25, 2006 NLT 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.

Responses should include price schedule, demonstrated capabilities to meet stated requirements and past performance information/references for recent/relevent performance (to include contract number, description, amount, date, POC).

Kelly Reserve Center facility using marmites or a similar insulated food container utilized for serving hot meals.
