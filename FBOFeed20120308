<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) #LCFDL12R5000 for Data Analytics Software Tools and Services for the LC/FEDLINK Program. The objective of the solicitation is to establish multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts for acquisition of or access to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) data analytics software applications and tools and analysis services for the FEDLINK program. FEDLINK is a nationwide interagency consortia sponsored by the Library of Congress. These will be multi-agency contracts (MACs) established in accordance with the Library of Congress (LC) Fiscal Operations Improvement Act, P.L. 106-481, Section 103 (2 U.S.C. &sect; 182c.) Any federal entity including the executive branch, the legislative branch, the judicial branch, and independent agencies as well as contractors to government agencies who are authorized to use federal sources of supply may be authorized to place orders under these contracts in accordance with the terms and procedures described in the solicitation.
<p>Contractors shall offer commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) data analytics software, applications and tools that analyze large complex structured and/or unstructured data from different data sources. These analysis tools shall have the ability to aggregate, store, mine, analyze and visualize large amounts of data to support the organization's decision making.

Products offered shall follow industry standards and should be scalable, flexible, and customizable. Data analytics software, applications and tools of interest are tools that can be used in all or part of the data analytics process including data mining, manipulation, modeling, querying, reports, visualization, statistical analysis, forecasting, text mining, text analytics, and predictive analytics.</p>
<p>Contractors shall be capable of providing products/services for ordering agencies with multiple organizational levels and geographic locations nationwide and/or worldwide. The Contractor shall also be capable of handling multiple purchase orders simultaneously. Contracts may be divided into three lots. Contractors must offer products/services under either Lot 1 and/or Lot 2 in order to provide products/services under Lot 3.

These data analytics tools shall have the ability to output data in popular formats and integrate with other commonly used applications. The tools shall allow users to monitor, analyze, and drill to details.</p>
<p>Contractors may offer integrated product suites that include query tools, dashboards and reporting software.

Visual discovery tools make it easy for users to see trends, patterns, and outliers in data. Data analytics software, applications and tools under Lot 1 shall enable users to conduct exploration and discovery on their own, without relying on experts or IT personnel. These tools shall require no programming or specialized training.</p>

<CONTACT>Sheila R. Edmonds, ContractSpecialist, Phone 3014966546, Fax 3014028169, Email sheila.edmonds@nih.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of the Director (OD) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences (OBSSR) intend to procure professional services on a sole source basis from the Society for Public Health Education (SOPHE), 10 G Street, Suite 605, Washington, DC 20002, to publish a special issue on "Systems Science Applications in Health Promotion and Public Health." The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 813410 and the business size standard is $7.0 million. The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months from date of award.
<p><br />Background: <br />The Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) furthers the mission of NIH by emphasizing the critical role that behavior and social factors play in health, health care, well-being. OBSSR serves as the focal point for coordination and development of policies, goals and objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research. OBSSR's vision is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve pressing health challenges facing our nation. OBSSR's plan includes facilitating: a) the next generation of basic behavioral and social sciences research: b) transdisciplinary "team science" that brings together the biomedical, behavioral, and social-ecological perspectives; c) research that integrates the systems and multiple levels of analysis; d) the translation, implementation, dissemination, and maintenance of best practices to strengthen the sciences of dissemination, put what is known into widespread practice, reduce the burden of chronic disease and help eliminate inequities in health and health care.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to produce a publication for the scientific community on a topic of key interest to OBSSR, the NIH program staff, the NIH investigator community, and to health researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. Specifically, the special supplement will contain articles on the application of systems science methodology to problems in the public health sphere. For the past 6 years OBSSR has been engaged in the development of activities and events designed to promote awareness of such methods and to provide education on their use. OBSSR has also been a leader in stimulating their use by NIH investigators in their behavioral and social science research projects by providing several funding opportunities in this new area.</p>
<p>The proposed supplement will provide a unique opportunity to showcase work in this nascent field, and depending on the manuscripts submitted, may feature work from grantees of the NIH ICs who have members on the Guest Editorial Board (FIC, NCI, NIA, and NIDCR) as well as other NIH investigators. The proposal is for approximately eight (8) to ten (10) full length articles and three (3) to four (4) shorter articles related to the application of systems science methodologies to health promotion and public health research questions. Particular methodologies of interest include, but are not limited to: system dynamics modeling, agent&#8208;based modeling, network analysis, microsimulation, operations research, and various engineering approaches.</p>
<p>The content of the supplement will depend to a large extent on the content of the manuscripts submitted to the Call For Papers to the specials issue, but there is a distinct need to illustrate examples of how systems science methods have been used to engage practical challenges and opportunities within real-world organizational settings. Specific topics of interest to the NIH include: <br /><br />&bull; Aging (including macroeconomic impact of population aging, social and economic behaviors in aging, and psychosocial stress, health and aging)<br />&bull; Arthritis<br />&bull; Asthma<br />&bull; Cancer<br />&bull; Cardiovascular disease<br />&bull; Child and maternal health<br />&bull; Chronic disease<br />&bull; Climate change and health<br />&bull; Developmental issues over the life course<br />&bull; Dietary behavior<br />&bull; Diabetes<br />&bull; Environment (including the behavioral and social and physical environment)<br />&bull; Health disparities<br />&bull; Health equity<br />&bull; Health services<br />&bull; HIV/AIDS<br />&bull; Hypertension<br />&bull; Infectious disease<br />&bull; Injury<br />&bull; Mental health<br />&bull; Oral Health<br />&bull; Overweight and obesity<br />&bull; Physical activity<br />&bull; Population health<br />&bull; Race, Ethnicity and Socioeconomic Status (SES) relation to health and morbidity across the life course<br />&bull; Social determinants of health<br />&bull; Social Insurance Systems<br />&bull; Substance use (including alcohol and other substances)<br />&bull; Tobacco use<br />&bull; Vaccination policy and/or behavior</p>
<p>The Guest Editors and the Guest Editorial Board will review what is submitted and determine (following peer review) which ones will be selected for inclusion in the special issue. It is expected that a few additional papers will be needed to fill in topical gaps not covered by papers selected from the call. For those papers, we may solicit contributions from specific people known for their work in this field. In addition to full length papers, we anticipate there will be an overview commentary written by the Guest Editors and Board and a few other commentaries on relevant topics. The main goal of the publication will be to showcase the work of the contributors, to indicate to the scientific community NIH's interest in supporting work in this area, and to alert the community that the journal Health Education and Behavior is a journal that encourages manuscripts in this area. This special issue is critical, given the growing interest at NIH and among the investigator community in use of systems science methods and the need for publication outlets for this work among the public health community.</p>
<p>Purpose/Objective: <br />The purpose of this requirement is to provide support for the planning and production of a Special Issue on Systems Science Applications in Health Promotion and Public Health in the journal Health Education and Behavior. This agreement provides for the support of the staff time of the publisher in planning and preparation activities for the special issue. This includes staff time for planning activities to include solicitation of reviewers, coordination and preparation of journal layout and content, and support for ongoing planning and editorial management meetings.</p>
<p>Contractor Tasks:<br />&#9679; The Contractor shall obtain peer review regarding appropriateness and scientific rigor of the submitted articles. <br />&#9679; After peer review, the Contractor shall submit accepted articles to the Guest Editors for review. <br />&#9679; The Contractor shall coordinate the submissions of commentary pieces as specified by the COTR/Guest Editor, including review by the Guest Editors and Guest Editorial Board. All activities will occur in consultation with the Guest Editors of the special issue and in cooperation with Sage Publishers, the journal's official publisher. <br />&#9679; The Contractor shall perform this work in Washington, DC. <br />&#9679; The Contractor shall be available by phone, fax and e-mail during normal business hours during the period of performance.</p>
<p>Deliverables: <br />The Contractor shall:<br />1. Organize reviewers for the submitted manuscripts, and conduct planning conference calls with Guest Editors by May 30, 2012.<br />2. Provide electronic versions of penultimate papers to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) and commentary authors by July 1, 2012.<br />3. Submit the final electronic draft versions of issue to the COTR for final review on or before September 30, 2012.<br />4. Produce and distribute the special issue to its subscribers on or around December 2012.<br />5. Provide 200 additional copies of the special issue to OBSSR for further distribution. <br />6. Provide open access to the full supplement on the Sage website. Provide information so that OBSSR and the participating NIH ICs can establish a link from their website to the Sage site, where anyone can download the PDFs.</p>
<p>Program Management and Control Requirements:<br />The OBSSR COTR will exercise management control over the project, communicate with the Contractor, and audit progress of journal supplement preparation. Telephone and e-mail conversation as well as in person meetings between OBSSR staff and Vendor are expected to identify unanticipated issues that will be documented and resolved.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Requirements:<br />The OBSSR COTR will review all documents produced during the performance period, provide feedback to the Contractor, and determine acceptability of progress updates and final reports. The OBSSR COTR will approve payment the Contractor upon completion and approval of the deliverable(s) and invoice(s).</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification:<br />The Society for Public Health Education (SOPHE) is the professional organization that owns and manages the journal Health Education and Behavior (HEB). Through its publications the SOPHE explores social and behavioral issues as they affect health. It also examines the processes of planning, implementing, managing, and assessing health education and social-behavioral interventions. The journal provides empirical research, case studies, program evaluations, literature reviews, and discussions of theories of health behavior and health status, as well as research methods to investigate social and behavioral health issues. SOPHE publications are essential resources for behavioral scientists, community organizers, government agencies, health care educators, health care facilities hospital administrators, HMO/managed care representatives, insurance company administrators, nurses, physicians, public health and community planners, social scientists, and social workers. SOPHE publishes journals that are disseminated to more than 2,100 SOPHE members, more than 600 institutions and libraries, and also enjoy widespread exposure through consortia arrangements. For the aforementioned reasons, SOPHE is uniquely qualified to perform this work. This experience and expertise are not readily available within the research community. Any efforts to identify the required skills and expertise through outside sources would pose additional undo costs to the government. Therefore, it would be in the best interest of the government to award the contract to the proposed vendor because of its unique ability to perform these tasks in a cost-efficient and timely manner.</p>

<RESPDATE>032212
<CONTACT>Sheila R. Edmonds, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014966546, Fax 3014028169, Email sheila.edmonds@nih.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of the Director (OD) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences (OBSSR) intend to procure professional services on a sole source basis from the American Public Health Association (APHA) to publish a special issue on "Social Science, The Environment, and Genetics": Working Title: Under Our Skin: Social Environments and our Nation's Health Considerations for Measuring Health Care Disparities." The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months from date of award.
<p><br />Background:<br />Over the past few decades, there has been a burst of scientific activity investigating how social<br />environments and experiences "get under the skin" to impact health across the life course. Credible candidate mechanisms and biological pathways that connect social experiences to health outcomes have begun to be identified (e.g., HPA axis, ANS, executive function) while other research explores how our genome and epigenome influences social health gradients, developmental trajectories and health outcomes (e.g. gene-by-environment interactions, epigenetic programming, social regulation of gene expression, culture-gene co-evolution).</p>
<p>OBSSR, in partnership with NIDA, is interested in developing a research supplement that advances integration of research efforts-not just by highlighting how research should integrate multiple levels of the social environment (neighborhood, family, individual) as is the tradition in current public health research analysis-but instead focusing on a fundamental heuristic which is often neglected: social causation is non-linear, time dependent, evolving and varied by scale. We believe that answering the questions that will take us to the next level of understanding of human health and development will require integration of research across a wide domain of scientific fields and expertise. To this end, OBSSR believes it can help advance the next generation of science by supporting a peer-reviewed research publication that exemplifies this interdisciplinary integration.</p>
<p>This special issue concept is in alignment with other national activities such as the National Academy of Science colloquium and the special supplement related to "Evolution in Health and Medicine" and the Institute of Medicine's report Genes, Behavior, and the Social Environment. It is also congruent with OBSSR's mission to integrate a bio-behavioral perspective across NIH's research areas and promote the integration of social environment and genetics/genomics/epigenetic research.</p>
<p>Finally, OBSSR believes this is an opportune time for a special supplemental issue to be devoted to these issues due to the maturation of several NIH investments in interdisciplinary research developing capacity for and encouraging cross-fertilization among social and behavioral and basic medical sciences, like the NIH consensus measures for Phenotypes and eXposures (PhenX, www.phenx.org), the Genes, Environment and Health Initiative (GEI, gei.nih.gov), and the Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet, oppnet.nih.gov).</p>
<p>Objective:<br />The Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) furthers the mission of the NIH by emphasizing the critical role that behavior and social factors play in health, health care, and well-being. OBSSR serves as the focal point for scientific coordination and is involved in the development of policies, goals, and research objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, and the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research.</p>
<p>OBSSR's vision is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve pressing health challenges facing our nation. OBSSR's plan includes facilitating: a) the next generation of basic behavioral and social sciences research: b) trans-disciplinary "team science" that brings together the biomedical, behavioral, and social-ecological perspectives; c) research that integrates the systems and multiple levels of analysis; d) the translation, implementation, dissemination, and maintenance of best practices to strengthen the sciences of dissemination and reduce the burden of chronic disease in an effort to reduce inequities in health and health care.</p>
<p>To this end, OBSSR proposes to support the development of a special peer-reviewed journal issue on Social Sciences, The Environment, and Genetics in the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH). The overall goal of the special journal issue is to focus on challenges in the field and to encourage interdisciplinary efforts that will encourage new innovative approaches when addressing the current research challenges.</p>
<p>Purpose of the Agreement:<br />OBSSR proposes to support the production of a Special Issue on Social Science, The Environment, and Genetics in the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH). The resultant purchase order will provide staff support, time of the publisher in planning and preparation activities for the special issue, coordination and preparation of journal layout and content, editorial input, and hardcopies to be distributed to all AJPH/APHA members, and print copies for the APHA/AJPH membership. This may include the possible solicitation of additional authors (if more papers are needed). All activities will occur in consultation with the Editors of the special issue. <br /><br />The issue will contain up to 30 accepted articles or no more than 160 pages formatted as a combination of editorials, commentaries, analytic essays, briefs, research articles and other article types as specified in the journal's instructions for authors. The specific abstracts have been submitted and accepted and can be aggregated into the following tentative themes:</p>
<p>Tentative Themes (based on accepted or invited submissions for development):</p>
<p>Health Disparities<br />Advancing Theory <br />Leveraging Research Designs <br />Inter Generational Effects/Life Course Perspective/Time-Dependent <br />Measurement and Methods <br />Candidate Mechanisms and other research</p>
<p>All articles that pass editorial and peer review will be published together as a collection. Other articles will be published as space allows.</p>
<p>Specific Contractor Tasks to be Undertaken Include:</p>
<p>The Contractor and its editorial team shall:<br />&bull; Conduct a blind review of all papers. Reviewers' comments will be transmitted to the authors and to the Guest Editor(s)/Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) (neither the authors nor any other Partners' staff will be privy to the reviewers' names).<br />&bull; Review all papers and determine those that are acceptable for publication.<br />&bull; Ensure that the quality of the material meets AJPH standards for a peer-reviewed publication.<br />&bull; Communicate with the Guest Editor(s)/COTR to better ensure that the final material reflects the desired scope and content. <br />&bull; Include the Guest Editor(s)/COTR in all communications regarding content and distribution of the material.<br />&bull; Provide editing and proofreading of the peer-reviewed papers, commentaries, and other text.<br />&bull; Provide other production and dissemination services (including mailing the print copies, loading the online issue onto the APHA/AJPH website, and distributing a news release to media outlets.)</p>
<p>As a partner, the NIH staff will:</p>
<p>&bull; Assign a lead guest editor or editorial team. The guest editor(s)' role, who will be NIH/OD and NIH/NIDA representatives, is to<br />o Direct authors to ensure that manuscripts provide a thought-provoking perspective and are relevant to the themes and topics addressed in the collection of papers. <br />o Facilitate the peer-review process by either 1) submitting manuscripts electronically on behalf of authors or 2) directing authors themselves to submit electronically at submit.ajph.org and also by advising authors on suitable peer reviewers to nominate. <br />o Work with AJPH staff during the entire production process. <br />o Prepare editorial text to guide readers of the theme issue with regard to its context and content. These written materials will not be subject to peer review, but will be subject to review by the AJPH editorial team, as per AJPH policy.</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure submission of source files of revised, accepted manuscripts to AJPH production staff according to a production schedule. The schedule will include approximately six (6) months for the peer review and revision process and approximately three (3) months for copyediting, proofreading, and other production processes that follow final acceptance and precede online publication.</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>Print copies to all AJPH/AJHA Membership and Electronic copies available by special order.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:<br />The period of performance will be twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>Timeline: <br />April 2012 paper submissions will be reviewed internally by an NIH committee and final manuscripts will be sent to APHA/AJPH in June. APHA/AJPH will then submit the papers to anonymous peer review and decide which papers should be published and which should be rejected; they will then publish the papers and make them accessible. The performance period should be approximately 9 months or a publication date around March 2013 assuming there are no delays.</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification:</p>
<p>The following depicts why APHA is uniquely positioned and qualified to implement this project, which includes reviewing and publishing on the intersection of genetics and social and behavioral sciences:</p>
<p>(1) The American Public Health Association (APHA) is the professional organization that owns and manages the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH), which is published monthly. APHA's AJPH is highly respected for its scientific rigor. In fact, the AJPH's scientific impact factor for 2010 was rated at 3.85, which translates to it being ranked #3 of 114 titles in the Public, Environmental and Occupational Health category in the Social Sciences Citation Index.</p>
<p>(2) Furthermore, the APHA separates itself in that it publishes the AJPH which is among the top scientific journals with long history publishing important scientific papers, but with an inter-disciplinary focus. The AJPH is the flagship publication for the American Public Health Association (APHA) and has been rated highly in terms of overall scientific impact. In fact, the journal was first published in the year 1911 and has gained a world wide reputation for being the place to publish the best inter-disciplinary work on a variety of topics, including methods, public health, social science, delivery, and health services. To be concrete, in addition to its #3 rating in Public, Environmental, and Occupational Health category ranking in the Social Sciences Citation Index, it was also nominated as on the most influential journals in Biology and Medicine over the last 100 years voted by Special Libraries Association.</p>
<p>(3) Finally, as a function of (1) highly respected for their top science and (2) being interdisciplinary, the other reason why APHA is uniquely positioned to review and publish this issue is that they are highly regarded for their fair and balanced review process. Although this is not as easy to quantify, their ability to review good science is a strong rationale for their high rankings mentioned in both 1 and 2 above.</p>
<p>As such APHA is uniquely positioned and qualified to implement this project as the organization is in alignment with the NIH's endeavors to expand the knowledge and understanding of public health that will help improve the health of individuals and populations. Therefore, in the best interest of the government this purchase order should be awarded to the American Public Health Association (APHA).</p>

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to negotiate on a sole source with Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI Institute), 5200 Butler Pike, Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462-1298 to procure a number of proprietary information products and databases relating to health services research and healthcare technology assessment from ECRI. ECRI shall provide the following data and services: (1) machine-readable records relating to health services research and healthcare technology assessment reports and literature collected, abstracted, and indexed by ECRI, (2) delivery of the updated Universal Medical Device Nomenclature System (UMDNS) vocabulary according to NLM's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) updating schedule, and (3) support for medical device nomenclatures and classification systems, clinical decision support, and health data standards activities. See Statement of Work for full description of these three (3) tasks.<br /><br />
<p>The Library recognizes the value of improving access to the health services research (HSR) and healthcare technology assessment (HTA) literature by including records in its databases from a number of sources, including important sources of grey literature, that is, publications that are not generally distributed through commercial publishing organizations. ECRI produces a number of information products and databases that cover HSR and HTA literature and some of ECRI's publications, e.g., Windows on Medical Technology, incorporate and synthesize findings from a wide variety of publications including grey literature publications. Additionally, NLM has an ongoing project, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS&reg;), which consists of major medical source vocabularies and classification systems, including ECRI's own Universal Medical Device Nomenclature System (UMDNS<sup>TM</sup>). It is important that ECRI's UMDNS vocabulary is updated in the UMLS on an annual basis. The work of ECRI is consistent with other efforts NLM has funded in the past to enhance access to important HSR information and medical source vocabularies.<br /><br />NLM is the U.S. affiliate to the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization (IHTSDO) and provides financial (membership), technical, and governance support to IHTSDO's vocabulary activities. It is anticipated that NLM will require additional support from ECRI in future years relating to medical device nomenclatures and classification systems, clinical decision support, and health data standards activities, especially those that relate to IHTSDO. ECRI is a contributing member of the Global Medical Device Nomenclature and has specialized, unique experience and expertise with this vocabulary. Additionally, ECRI has unique and specialized experience and expertise in preparing information for implementation within clinical decision support systems from their work with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's National Guidelines Clearinghouse. This expertise is needed for NLM's own information products and services.<br /><br />ECRI, an independent, non-profit organization, is a publisher and producer of a number of proprietary databases and information products, e.g., the Healthcare Standards Directory, relating to health services research and healthcare technology assessment.

<a href="mailto:mark.gelsinger@eu.navy.mil">mark.gelsinger@eu.navy.mil</a>
<DESC>Construction services are required for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)  multiple award construction contract (MACC) for various construction projects under the cognizance of Naval Facilities Engineering Command Europe, Africa and Southwest Asia (NAVFAC EURAFSWA), Facilities Engineering Acquisition Division (FEAD) Sigonella, Sicily.  NAVFAC EURAFSWA/FEAD Sigonella is the Department of Defenses Executive Agent for Construction in Sicily.

FEAD Sigonella is responsible for all contracting actions in Sicily.  This single solicitation will result in the award of a minimum of three firm-fixed-price MACC contracts.  The scope of work is for a broad range of new construction, renovation, repair, additions or upgrades of facilities (including design-build).
  Work to be performed under this MACC will be with the primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  However, it will also include Subsection 237, Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction and Subsection 238, Specialty Trade Contractors.  This procurement is being advertised on an UNRESTRICTED basis inviting full and open competition.

All work under the MACC will be initiated by task orders that are competed amongst only the MACC holders (firms awarded one of the potential contracts).  Task orders will either be design-bid-build (100% design provided by the Government) or design-build.  Work will include new construction, renovation, repair, additions or upgrades of facilities, including, but not limited to: barracks/dormitories, administrative facilities, communication facilities, educational facilities, medical/dental/hospital facilities, dining facilities, industrial facilities, warehouse facilities, ranges, operational/training facilities, roads, streets, bridges, site utilities/infrastructure, waterfront/marine facilities, piers/wharves, dredging and aviation facilities (including hangars, runways and aprons), recreational/quality of life facilities and other base development facilities throughout Sicily.
  Projects will require incorporation of sustainable features such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) building standards.  The Government reserves the right to cancel the procurement if only one proposal is received or less than three offerors are evaluated as eligible for award.

The contract period of performance is anticipated to consist of a 12-month base period and four (4) potential 12-month option periods for a total maximum duration of 60 months.  The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is 20,000,000.  Task orders will typically range from 100,000 to 3,000,000.  Task orders may be above or below this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract.
  Task orders may require both design and construction services.  The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, in terms of the contract, a minimum of 10,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee during the performance period of the contract.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  

In support of the design-build task orders, MACC holders shall retain the services of professional architect-engineer (A-E) firms experienced with multi-disciplined architectural-engineering design efforts.  A-E firms employed shall have U.S. professional or equivalent qualifications

This procurement will utilize best value source selection tradeoff procedures, requiring the submission of both technical and price proposals.
  The technical evaluation factors are anticipated to be as follows:  Factor 1, Experience; Factor 2  Past Performance; Factor 3- Safety; and Factor 4, Technical Solution (Seed Project Evaluation Plan).  The Contract-to-Budget amount for the Seed Project, Repair of the Heating System in Building 545, is 308,000.   

The Initial or Seed Project for the MACC will be a Design-Build Task Order, specifically Work Order Number 1152409, Repair Heating System in Building 545, NAS II Sigonella, Sicily.  The project corrects mechanical system deficiencies and repair to architectural finishes in Bachelor Officers Quarters (BOQ) Building 545.  Repair is required to restore fully functioning Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems to enable this facility to support the BOQ operation.
  The building also houses the only conference center on NAS II, Sigonellas operational base, named the Duomo Conference Center, which is currently closed due to excessive damage caused by water leaks.  THE NORTH AMERICAN  INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION CODE FOR THE SEED PROJECT IS 238220.  The Societ Organismo di Attestazione (SOA) classification for the seed project is OG1, Class 2.

A pre-proposal conference is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, 3 April 2012 at 10:00 A.M. Central European Time (CET) in the Public Works Conference Room, Building 318, Sigonella, Sicily.  A site visit for the seed project will be held immediately after the pre-proposal conference.  ATTENDEES MUST PRE-REGISTER FOR THE CONFERENCE AND SITE VISIT BY SENDING AN E-MAIL TO MS.
 CRISTINA LAURIA AT CRISTINA.LAURIA.IT@EU.NAVY.MIL by 13:00 on Wednesday, 28 March 2012.  A maximum of three (3) representatives will be allowed per firm.  For offerors that do not have access to Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, please submit the following documents for access to the base to MS CRISTINA LAURIA AT CRISTINA.LAURIA.IT@EU.NAVY.MIL: (1) Copy of the identification card or drivers license (carta d'identit and/or patente) for each attendee; and (2) Copy of registration certificate (libretto di circolazione) and insurance for each vehicle requiring access to the base.  Failure to submit the required information will cause delays in obtaining access onto the base on the day of the pre-proposal conference/site visit.

This is a new procurement, and therefore it does not replace an existing contract.
  No information exists on prior contracts.  

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about 23 March 2012.  The RFP will be available through the European Navy Electronic Commerce Online (EURONECO) website at https://euro.neco.navy.mil.  Printed copies of the RFP will not be issued.  Amendments will normally be posted to the website https://euro.neco.navy.mil.  It is highly recommended that firms register on the EURONECO and Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov as a plan holder as this will be the only plan holders list available.  It is the offerors responsibility to check the EURO-NECO and FBO website periodically for any amendments to the solicitation.

Offerors are required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov.

<a href="mailto:hanh.h.chau@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  ASOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BEREQUESTED.The Department of the Navy Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center(SPAWARSYSCEN), Atlantic, (SSC LANT) in Charleston, SC intends to acquire, ona sole source basis, Raytheon Tactical Beyond Line of Sight (TBLOS) system(part # H448871), spares kits, individual spares, warranties, training andengineering support services.  This acquisition is for use with existing SOFDeployable Node (SDN) systems currently supported under the SpecialOperations Communications Systems IPT.  This system provides highbandwidth connectivity between units that cannot be interconnected via Line ofSight systems due to terrain or distance, but without requiring the use ofsatellite communications resources.  The NAICS Code is 334290 and the SizeStandard in Number of Employees is 750. This acquisition is anticipated to bean Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Firm-Fixed-Price type contract withabase year and four one-year option periods. The performance of the base yearis one year from date of award that is expected to occur in 3rd Qtr FY13. Theproposed sole source contractor, Raytheon Company, is the Original EquipmentManufacturer (OEM) for the TBLOS system which is a Raytheon-designed andmanufactured proprietary communication system  FAR 6.302-1.  Thisacquisition is based on the determination that the Government's need can bestbe satisfied by supplies and services available from only one source. THISNOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Any questionsconcerning this sole source procurement must be received in our office notlaterthan 23 March 2012 at 1500PM (EDT).  The Contract Negotiator for thisrequirement is Mr. Hanh Chau who may be reached via email athanh.h.chau@navy.mil.

<p>2. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131)<br />U S COAST GUARD<br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS<br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112<br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>(xiii) See additional document(s) for uploaded documents to support order requirements: Brand Name JOTFOC<br />(xiv) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS): N/A</p>
<p>(xv) QUOTES ARE DUE BY 4:30 PM EST Thursday March 15th, 2012; Deadline for questions will be Wednesday March 14th, 2012 @ 1:30 PM EST. Please email your quotes and questions to Iris.M.Johnson@uscg.mil.</p>

<DESC>Market Survey  Rotary Kiln Improvement
The Army Contracting Command - Picatinny (ACC- Picatinny) is conducting market research of companies capable of developing a productivity improvement plan to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of rotary kiln incinerators that currently support demilitarization of the Conventional Demilitarization Stockpile.  The goal is to reduce the operating cost per ton and increase the annual throughput of rotary kiln operations that dispose of conventional munitions.  A productivity improvement plan which defines specific technology improvements, process modifications, and operational procedure modifications would be the final deliverable that will define methods for achieving the goal.   The plan will include a description of each productivity improvement initiative and the associated implementation costs, timelines, benefits, and risks. The major focus of the productivity plan shall be improvements/upgrade/replacement of pollution abatement system and permitting changes and modifications.
The effort would include an engineering assessment of the current U. S. rotary kiln hazardous waste incinerator operations and environmental permits for processing conventional munitions.  The assessment shall include review/assessment of equipment design and capabilities, operating procedures, safety, pre-processing operations, post processing operations, monitoring and control system, program logic control (PLC), maintenance procedures, manpower usage, operating frequency, workload, and regulatory drives including environmental permitting.  The analysis will be used as the basis for the development of a productivity improvement plan to reduce the operating cost and increase annual throughput of the rotary kiln furnaces for demil of conventional munitions.
Interested companies who feel they have the necessary skills to execute the effort describe above should respond by providing the government the following information: a brief summary of the companys capabilities (a description of facilities, personnel, and past experience directly applicable to this effort) and specifically illustrate expertise in rotary kiln furnace equipment and operations, pollution abatement systems, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations and the permitting processes.

<p>Physical Demands<br />In Afghanistan, the work is principally sedentary, however frequent travel in and around, or being stationed in Afghanistan provinces, is likely. While on a site visit there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances - the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Extended onsite visits to remote project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also often a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty, windy, and polluted environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty or polluted environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.<br />Period of Performance - The period of performance for this order will be one year from the date of award with the option to renew.</p>
<p>C. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS<br />a. U.S. citizen, eligible for a State Department Secret or Top Secret security clearance.</p>
<p>b. J.D. from an accredited law school.<br />c. At least 10 years of legal experience.<br />d. Excellent writing and communication skills.<br />e.

Familiarity with international organizations involved in justice program components in missions around the world, and demonstrated ability in coordinating programs in a multi-agency, multi-donor environment.<br />IV. POSITION ELEMENTS<br />Supervisory Controls: The incumbent reports to and receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the INL/Kabul Justice Program Manager or Parwan Engagement Team. The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.</p>
<p>The incumbent coordinates and communicates with the INL/Kabul Justice and Corrections Advisors, and the INL/AP Rule of Law and Corrections Teams. The incumbent's actions, decisions, and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations. Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.</p>

<DESC>Title: Testing Hierarchical HIV Prevention Messages for Black and Latino Men who have Sex with Men via Texting and Computer Delivery Modalities
<p>Notice Type: Sources Sought</p>
<p>Synopsis: <br />This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential vendors (including, but not limited to, small business (e.g. 8 (a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, and women-owned small business) that can conduct a randomized control trial research study on a large sample of HIV+ and HIV- black and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) in 2-3 US cities (at least 1 in the southeastern US) over 2 years.</p>
<p>Background:<br />Black and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to have very high incidence of HIV infection in the United States - particularly black MSM (Prejean, 2011), and new approaches are needed to reach and reduce HIV risk behavior of minority MSM. For 30 years, condoms have been the only effective physical intervention for reducing HIV infection risk, and thus correct and consistent condom use has been the single "gold standard" message available to sexually-active MSM for protecting themselves and their partners.</p>
<p>Recently, multiple biomedical intervention options have become available. Results have been presented for partial efficacy of pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis (PrEP) with anti-retroviral (ARV) medications (Grant 2010), and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is already available in emergency situations. Although there are serious concerns about access to PrEP for many people, recent studies have found that minority (vs. white) MSM were more likely to use (by HIV-negative MSM) and share with sex partners (by HIV-positive MSM) non-prescribed PrEP and PEP several years before known efficacy (Mansergh 2010). Further, minority (vs. white) MSM were more willing to use a less efficacious PrEP product in order to avoid using condoms (Koblin 2011), and were more willing to use PrEP even after PrEP efficacy results were known (Sullivan 2011). PrEP and PEP are likely to be prescribed only to HIV-negative MSM at highest risk for HIV transmission (by HIV-positives) and infection (by currently risky HIV-negatives). Even if PrEP access is not an issue, other biomedical interventions may not be too far in the future (e.g., topical ARV gels). Some studies (Marks 2010) have suggested that behavioral "seroadaptative" approaches may be an appropriate alternative for some - especially HIV-positive MSM. The relatively heightened willingness among some racial/ethnic minority MSM to use alternative products, and perhaps other HIV prevention intervention approaches, needs to be further understood. To help accomplish this, effective hierarchical messages are needed for multiple prevention options of varying levels of effectiveness.</p>
<p>Little research has been conducted on the effects of focused hierarchical messaging in HIV prevention beyond single messaging of condom use. However, a study of hierarchical (vs. male condom only) messages for young black and Latino women found that women who received the hierarchical message (i.e., use male condoms; if not use female condoms...) were less likely to report that male condoms were effective in reducing HIV infection (Miller 2004). Adding a second option to an existing established option can potentially impact perceptions about, and intentions to use, various prevention options in the future.</p>
<p>Are there communication approaches to maximize HIV infection risk reduction in a world of multiple effective options? For example, text messaging has demonstrated promise as an intervention approach for high-risk MSM (Reback 2011), but is it differentially effective compared to computer-delivered messaging of risk information? We are now entering an era of multiple prevention options (Shattock 2011) -- including PrEP, PEP, a topical ARV gel, or HIV seroadaptive behaviors (e.g., behavioral decisions based on viral load and anal sex position) -- and we need to prepare for disseminating simple and effective public health messages that clearly present these options to various populations at risk for HIV acquisition and transmission - particularly black and Latino MSM. Different hierarchical message options are likely to apply to HIV-positive, high-risk HIV-negative, and low-risk HIV-negative MSM. Implications of the findings of this research contract may apply to a variety of public health actions, from fact sheets to social marketing campaigns to federal guidelines, and may inform messaging within behavioral interventions currently implemented in communities of black and Latino MSM, as well as other populations.</p>
<p>This proposal is aligned with the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) and the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP) Strategic Plan as they relate to black and Latino MSM: Goal 1. Reducing New HIV Infections : Step 2. Expand targeted efforts to prevent HIV infection using a combination of effective, evidence-based approaches (2.1. Design and evaluate innovative prevention strategies and combination approaches for preventing HIV in high-risk communities; and 2.4. Expand prevention with HIV-positive individuals.).</p>
<p>Purpose and research questions:<br />The purpose of this sources sought document is to assess contractor capabilities for conducting a randomized-control research trial that will test the efficacy of hierarchical prevention option messages compared to condom-only messages for HIV-positive, high-risk HIV-negative, and other HIV-negative, black and Latino MSM when delivered via texting and computer. Potential secondary prevention options that may be addressed in the messages include, but are not limited to, PrEP, PEP, future topical chemoprophylaxis, and HIV seroadaptive behaviors (e.g., behavioral decisions based on viral load and anal sex position), however subsequent options will vary across the groups. For example, HIV serosorting may be a secondary option for HIV-positive men, and PrEP may be a secondary option for high-risk HIV-negative men. The research questions are:<br />1. Do hierarchical prevention option messages (vs. condom-only messages) potentially increase or reduce perceived effectiveness of and behavioral intentions to use various HIV prevention options among HIV-positive, high-risk HIV-negative, and other HIV-negative, black and Latino MSM?<br />2. Are hierarchical and condom-only messages equally efficacious for black and Latino MSM in altering perceived effectiveness of and behavioral intention to use various prevention options?<br />3. Are hierarchical and condom-only messages delivered via text and computer-delivered messaging equally efficacious in altering perceived effectiveness of and behavioral intention to use various prevention options?</p>
<p>The Vendor shall demonstrate capability with the following requirements:<br />1. Demonstrate evidence of conducting randomized-control trial studies. <br />2. Demonstrate evidence of recruiting and enrolling large samples of HIV-positive and HIV-negative, black (n=600+) and Latino (n=600+) MSM, including developing and using targeted recruitment and retention materials.<br />3. Demonstrate evidence of conducting research in multiple (2-3) cities, either directly or through subcontracts, including at least 1 city in the Southeast US. <br />4. Demonstrate evidence of the ability to develop a research protocol and obtain IRB and OMB approval for HIV related research projects.<br />5. Demonstrate evidence of the ability to hire and train peer staff for study recruitment and assessment.<br />6. Demonstrate evidence of previous research or evaluation of HIV risk-related text messages and computer-delivered messages.<br />7. Demonstrate evidence of developing and implementing behavioral assessment instruments.<br />8. Demonstrate the ability to safely and securely collect, store, download, merge, transfer, clean, and manage large datasets, as well as provide simple data frequencies and descriptive statistics to ensure clean data. <br /><br />Capability Statement: <br />Vendors that believe that they have the ability to satisfy all of the above stated objectives are encouraged to submit a capability statement. The capability statements will be evaluated based on the information provided in relation to the research questions and requirements above and the current in-house capacity to perform the work including: (a) staff availability, experience, and training; (b) prior completed projects of a similar nature; and (c) examples of similar prior completed contracts, dollar value of the contracts, references, and other related information.</p>
<p>Capability statements must demonstrate the requirements outlined above. Capability statements shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, and business size and status (e.g. small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, and women owned small business). The remainder of the capability statement should be tailored to the requirements stated above and must demonstrate that similar research activities have been performed in the past.</p>
<p>Submission Instructions:<br />Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit a capability statement of up to 10 pages via email to Jerry Outley (Jmo4@cdc.gov). The subject line of the email shall be "Testing Hierarchical Prevention Messages for Black and Latino MSM". Responses are due no later than March 22, 2012 by 4:00PM EST. Capability statements will not be accepted after the due date.<br /><br />&emsp;<br />Disclaimer and Important Notes: <br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response.

<a href="mailto:honegger.harold@epa.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Office of Acquisition Management, intends to issue a sole source firm-fixed price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to the Carolina Population Center (CPC) to gain access to the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) dataset in order to develop analytical methods to link the physical and chemical properties of air pollutants to better inform the periodic reviews of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS).  Based on the Add Health study protocols approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board, the CPC is the only organization permitted to handle the geocoded Add Health dataset, which is necessary for linking the air pollutant data to Add Health for each study participant.  As such, the CPC is uniquely qualified for the tasks delineated below, which includes forming data l inkages, de-identification, and deductive disclosure analysis needed to build the merged air quality-Add Health dataset available to the USEPA and to the larger scientific community.
A sole source purchase order is appropriate and necessary because the CPC is the sole purveyor of the Add Health dataset.  EPA is not aware of any other contractor that has the Carolina Population Center?s access to the Add Health data and scientific technical expertise.  Selection of any other contractor would delay the scientific professional services, duplicate cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through the competition of this specialized requirement.  Notwithstanding, any contractor that believes they are capable of meeting EPA's requirements as stated herein may submit evidence of such capability within 15 days of this posting.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  
The anticipate period of performance for this requirement is April 1, 2012?October 31, 2013.  All questions, comments, and capability statements regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to the Contracting Officer, Harold Honegger, at honegger.harold@epa.gov  
BACKGROUND:
 EPA is interested in developing analytical methods to link the physical and chemical properties of air pollutants to better inform the periodic reviews of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS).  The Agency is currently in the process of planning a multipollutant science assessment (MSA) whereby the health effects of exposures to mixtures of air pollutants, particularly the criteria air pollutants, may be systematically evaluated.  The database obtained from the work will be of importance to NCEA/RTP to perform analyses in its effort to develop an MSA as well as to support its mission to produce Integrated Science Assessments (ISAs) for specific criteria pollutants as part of the NAAQS reviews.  
The science assessments typically rely upon existing data from previous studies and peer-reviewed journals.  However, very few studies have linked air pollutant concentrations with human health data for a sample of the population that is sufficiently large, diverse, and spatially dispersed to develop a national inference.  The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) is uniquely suitable for this project because no other study offering a national inference has been longitudinal.  Add Health has developed a geocoded database with health response, biomarker, demographic, and social variables that is sufficiently large (roughly 90,000 initial participants), diverse (self-reported 60.5% white, 19.0% black or African American, 7.0% Asian/Pacific Islander, 5.4% Indian or Native American, 9.7% other; 17.2% Hispanic), and spatially dispersed (participants now live within all 50 states within the United States).  The geocoded data are necessary to link the Add Hea lth participants to monitored and modeled air pollutant concentration data based on time and location.  The Add Health database is especially appropriate for the analyses planned for the MSA because: (1) The Add Health database includes several biometric parameters of cardiovascular health, which may be more accurate indicators of disease compared with self-reported data. (2) The Add Health database comprises young adults currently ages 27-35, who have been followed since 1994-95 when they were in the 7th-12th grades.  There have not been extensive air pollution epidemiology studies among adolescents and young adults. (3) The Add Health cohort exhibited high rates of obesity (36%), hypertension (19%), and diabetes (5-15%) at Wave IV (2008), which may make this group more susceptible to cardiovascular health effects related to air pollution exposure. (4) The Add Health study has a progressive data sharing policy that enables linkage of Add Health with other datasets to meet t he objectives of this study.  This policy is beneficial because the new dataset linking air pollutant concentrations to the Add Health participants will become a resource to the larger scientific community.  Add Health also is an ongoing study, offering continued longitudinal analysis of the health effects of air pollution among this cohort as subsequent waves of data are collected in the future.  If the EPA should identify a need to link air quality data with a health database in the future, EPA scientists would benefit from having longitudinal data available for subsequent analysis by using the Add Health cohort.

The long-term goal of this research is to develop a method for explaining population-level health effects with the physico-chemical properties of ambient air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM) component and gaseous air pollutants.  The novel aspect of this work is that toxicological evidence of the mechanisms underlying adverse health effects of air pollutants will be accounted for in the epidemiological model.  Air pollutants will be grouped by their oxidative properties using hierarchical methods.  Epidemiological models exploring the relationships between adverse cardiovascular health effects and pollutants? oxidative properties will be developed using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) database combined with air pollutant concentration data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).  This work is guided by the hypothesis that an epidemiological model accounting for air pollutants? toxicological properties w ill provide a robust, accurate, and precise representation of health effects that yields new insights into potential mechanisms of air pollutants effects on health.
The objective of this project is to create a database that can be used for analysis of the relationship of health outcomes with air pollutant concentrations and properties of air pollutants. The Contractor shall merge data from the National Longitudinal Study for Adolescent Health Cohort (Add Health) with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) monitoring data for components of particulate matter (PM) and several gaseous pollutants.  Additionally, data from Add Health shall also be merged with output from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model for select pollutants to extend the spatial coverage of the Add Health cohort.   The datasets created under this work assignment (WA) will be used in analyses that support the U.S. EPA?s new Multipollutant Science Assessment.
TASKS:
The Contractor shall accomplish the following tasks and shall complete these tasks according to the estimated deliverable schedule below.  Because these tasks are important to the EPA?s mandated environmental objectives, any late deliverables may negatively affect the outcome of the entire project.		Task 1:  Establish Communication 
Within 3 days of award of this WA, the Contractor shall schedule a meeting or conference call with the work assignment manager (WAM) and appropriate contractor staff to clarify outstanding questions and confirm the schedule and specific tasks.  The Contractor shall initiate additional communication with the WAM should developments arise that will affect the conduct or schedule for development of this work assignment.  The Contractor shall maintain communication with the WAM through weekly phone calls or email updates. 
Task 2. Prepare a Quality Assurance Project Plan
The Contractor shall provide an EPA R5-compliant quality assurance project plan (QAPP) for Tasks 3 through 6.  Guidance for QAPP development can be found at: http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/r5-final.pdf.
Task 3.	Merge Add Health Data with AQS and CMAQ Datasets
The Contractor shall merge the Add Health database with and the AQS database and CMAQ modeling results.  AQS and CMAQ data will be presented in a series of files provided by the WAM to the Contractor.  The AQS files will contain data records for each date of sampling and monitor combination in the United States during the months that span Waves III-IV of Add Health.  For each monitoring site, latitude and longitude, sampler identification number, temperature, and pollutant concentrations will be provided.  For the AQS data, the Contractor shall employ geographical information systems (GIS) to create a buffer around each Add Health participant based on their home latitude and longitude. The size of the buffer is to be determined based on a combination of factors including spatial transport scale of the different pollutants, number of Add Health participants with assigned data, and locations of the monitors.  The WAM will work collaboratively with the Contractor to test whether  a sufficient number of Add Health participants are included in the study following the initial buffer scheme.  If needed, the buffers may be adjusted after this initial test. Next, the concentrations, temperature, sampling date, and pseudocoded monitor identification number shall be assigned to each Add Health participant if the monitor latitude and longitude fall within the buffer and the annual concentration average has 75% data completeness within the date of Add Health participant response.  If more than one monitor falls within a participant?s buffer and contains the same air pollutants, then the concentrations shall be weighted according to an inverse distance weighting algorithm.  If no data were acquired for a concentration field within a participant?s buffer and questionnaire date, then that concentration field shall be assigned a null value for that subject and Wave. 
The CMAQ data files will include grid cell concentration data for ozone, sulfate, nitrate, elemental carbon, secondary organic carbon, and ammonium.  Also included in this file will be latitude/longitude of the upper left corner of each grid cell included in the surface, average temperature and humidity for each grid cell, date, and an identification number for each grid cell. The files will contain time averaged data for each grid cell covering the CONUS during the months that span Waves III-IV of Add Health.  The Contractor shall employ geographical information systems (GIS) to identify the home location of each Add Health participant based on their home latitude and longitude and link that participant to a grid cell in the surface concentration profile. The Contractor shall also assign a pseudocoded identification number to each grid cell; in the Add Health-CMAQ dataset, the pseudocoded identification number shall replace the initial grid cell identification number provide d. The WAM will work collaboratively with the Contractor to test whether a sufficient number of Add Health participants are included in each grid cell.  If needed, the grid cell sizes may be adjusted after this initial test. Next, the concentrations, temperature, and pseudocoded monitor identification number shall be assigned to each Add Health participant based on their location within a grid cell for a given averaging time within each Wave.  
The contractor shall participate in periodic telephone meetings with EPA staff to discuss the database merger.  
Task 4. De-Identify and Perform Deductive Disclosure Testing of the Merged Databases
Once all participants have received concentration assignments for each Wave, the dataset shall be de-identified.  The WAM will work collaboratively with the Contractor to refine these plans in accordance with any unforeseen considerations related to performing the data merge. The Contractor shall merge the data in a secure data facility.  After de-identification, the Contractor shall assign the remaining Add Health variables to each data record.  The Contractor shall hold periodic teleconferences with the WAM to update the status of the de-identification process.
Task 5. Provide Data Sets
The Contractor shall clean the datasets in consultation with the WAM and then shall make the data available to the WAM on the Add Health Terminal Server (AHTS) or by hard copy (i.e., disk).
Task 6.	Prepare Documentation of the Merged Databases
Documentation of the compiled datasets shall be prepared by the Contractor.  This shall include a comprehensive listing of the variables included in the dataset.  The Contractor shall participate in periodic telephone meetings with EPA staff to discuss plans for written descriptions of the analysis.  Any written material should be prepared using Microsoft Word and submitted electronically.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The 377th Civil Engineer Group, Kirtland Air Force Base (Albuquerque) NM 87117 requires a bridge contract to succeed contract FA9401-11-C-0010 which expires on 31 March 2012. The bridge contract will consist of a Nine (9) month basic period of performance with nine 1-month options. The AFNWC/PKOC intends to make an award to Chugach Management Services, Joint Venture (CMSJV), 3800 Centerpoint Drive, Ste 601, Anchorage, AK 99503. Interested parties may e-mail susan.mcdaniel@kirtland.af.mil or fax 505-853-1540, Attn: Susan McDaniel, not later than 15 March 2012, 12:00 p.m. (Noon) MST.
<p>IAW FAR Part 5.207(c)(15), the proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one (1) source under the authority of FAR 6.302. <br /><br />The Contractor shall provide all management personnel and services necessary to operate the facilities. The 337th Civil Engineer Division services include: Administration Management &amp; Customer Support; Facility &amp; Infrastructure Maintenance &amp; Support; Operations (Physical Plant Operations); Grounds Maintenance, Refuse Collection &amp; Disposal; Architect/Engineer Services (Planning, Programming, Design &amp; Construction Management); Real Property Management; Logistics Support (Material Control) and Civil Engineer Computer Systems Management.<br /><br />Kirtland AFB consists of over 3,100 facilities over 51,500 acres, and supports over 160 mission partner agencies. Kirtland facilities include: 1,780 facilities with 7,437,024 square feet of floor space; 223 miles of water pipe lines; 139 miles of fences; 97 miles of sanitary sewer lines; 87 miles of natural gas lines; 41 miles of communication ducts; 750 miles of roads; 731 miles of electrical transmission and distribution lines; 20 Electrical substations; over 1.38M square yards of Airfield pavement; over 161 BBL of Petroleum Storage; and a Land Fill operation. Geographically separate site locations supported include Maui, HI; Socorro, NM; Truth or Consequences, NM; Pecos, NM; and Albuquerque, NM. The highest level of security clearance required for this contract is TOP SECRET. Twenty-four hour customer service call, emergency response and plant operations are required. Personnel filling selected responsible positions shall possess appropriate licensing and certifications.</p>
<p><strong>This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. <br /><br /></strong>DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) <br /><br />CMSJV is the only company with the personnel, tools, equipment, vehicles, and materiel mobilized to perform these services which are essential and mission critical to Kirtland AFB, its nuclear surety mission, mission partners and the base population without a lapse in service or a duplication of significant capital investment and start-up costs. Any contractor except CMSJV would, of necessity, experience investment or start-up costs for this large operation, and the government would not recover such costs through competition of the bridge contract simply because of the extremely short contract term.<br />As the incumbent for the past eleven (11) years, CMSJV appears to be the only contractor who is fully knowledgeable of the requirements and level of effort required to meet the needs of the base population to sustain the level of service required and ensure no Notices of Violation are received for failure to meet all federal and state regulations and requirements. This is important because Kirtland AFB has to provide a safe, secure, and healthy environment to support the nuclear surety mission, as well as the Kirtland mission partners, and residents, while supporting the war fighter, without any interruption of critical infrastructure services.<br />Changeover from the current contract with CMSJV to a bridge contract with CMSJV will be transparent to Kirtland AFB in terms of contractor performance. Award of the bridge contract to another contractor will not produce seamless performance. The result would be degradation of Kirtland AFB's nuclear surety program and an interruption of services which Kirtland AFB cannot absorb and still meet its peacetime and wartime missions.</p>
<p>In summary, several contractors can perform these services on a long-term basis, as the October 2009 sources sought indicates; however, there is only one (1) contractor (CMSJV) who appears to be capable of performing these services on a short-term basis (i.e., bridge contract) with no service interruptions and without added investment and start-up costs.&emsp;</p>

Since the copiers remain on the installation and must be removed within the next six months there is no possibility that other contractors can meet the current requirement for use of these copiers until their removal. Comments should be submitted to the contracting office by email to: Dennis.g.donaldson.civ@mail.mil, no later than 19 March 2012 at 1200 MST. Comments submitted for consideration of other methods will not be evaluated. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333293. <br><br>

<DESC><p>Notice of Proposed Contract Action: <br />Project Name/RFQ#: Access Control System (Key Card Entry) RFQ-1112<br />Project Site: Western Oregon Service Unit, Salem, Oregon<br />RE: Sole Source/ Justification for other than full and open competition<br />Agency/Contracting Activity: Indian Health Service, Portland Area Office, 1414 NW Northrup, Ste. 800, Portland, Oregon, 97209<br />Authority: FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The government intends to award a sole source procurement to Aronson Security Group, Inc. (ASG) under the authority cited under FAR 6.302-1, FAR 13.106-1(b). This is not a request for competitive quotes. A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 b)(1)(i), Only One Responsible Source, and per the department's acquisition regulation at HHSAR 306.303-1(b)(1). Simplified Acquisitions Procedures with aspects of FAR Part 36 is the proposed acquisition method. <br />The requirement is for the installation of a Physical Access Control System at the IHS's Western Oregon Service Unit in Salem, Oregon. The applicable NAICS code is 541519, Information Technology Value Added Resellers. The system shall be a client system compatible with existing host system at the Portland Area Office. <br />The requirement includes the following: Installation (including some construction/retrofitting of clinic's electrical and door hardware) of a Physical Access Control System / Key Card Reader system. The components of the system include card readers to control 8 doors, a card panel, OnGuard software, value added services including system set up/ customization and database segmentation. Customization will also include vendor services to define alarm notifications. The proposed vendor will also provide on-site training of personnel on use of the system. The procurement includes a requirement for a brand-name justification (Lenel/OnGuard) and the proposed installer must be certified by the manufacturer, Lenel. <br />Market research was conducted to determine if the project could be solicited competitively. The manufacturer of the equipment, Lenel, was contacted to determine if Lenel-certified installers were available on GSA schedule to provide installation services for the Salem/Portland area. Lenel indicated that no Lenel-certified installers were available on GSA schedule to serve this area. <br />The proposed contractor, Aronson Security Group (ASG), is the existing "vendor of record" for the Portland Area host system and installed the system at the Portland Area office. ASG is Lenel-certified and has knowledge of the existing Portland office. The Portland Area IHS's existing service and maintenance agreement with ASG, in effect through August 2012, prohibits third party labor, parts, or equipment without voiding the agreement. <br />The Contracting Officer will ensure that all prices paid for hardware, software, and components will be fair and reasonable. The prices paid for installation / construction services can be considered fair and reasonable based on review of prior acquisitions for similar systems by the agency.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Anita MacAuley at (503) 414-5524 or by email to Anita.MacAuley@ihs.gov.</p>

Global Technologies Group, Inc., is considered the supplier who can supply update services and periodic maintenance for an existing Global Digital Asset Management System (GDAMS) for the acquisition, storage, management, and distribution of still and video imagery. The GDAMS uniquely combines required technical capability in a single, integrated functional package, and office workflow is built around this system.  Maintenance of this system is a technologically current status is therefore the key to continued readiness and daily functionality.  Update or maintenance of the system by any other source could potentially compromise its operational readiness, would require familiarization time at additional expense, and void our current maintenance contract.
  Specifically, changes in workflow and software interface characteristics, and the incorporation of new technology can only be accomplished by the OEM manufacturer acting through a designated technical agent. Global Technologies Group, Inc. is the sustaining vendor and is proprietary developer of the complex technical enhancements now required. The applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541512.

<DESC>The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has proposed to increase small business size standards for 37 industries in North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Sector 56, Administrative and Support, Waste Management and Remediation Services. As part of its ongoing comprehensive review of all size standards, SBA evaluated all receipts based standards in NAICS Sector 56 to determine whether the existing size standards should be retained or revised. This proposed rule is one of a series of proposals that examine size standards of industries grouped by an NAICS Sector. SBA issued a White Paper entitled "Size Standards Methodology" and published a notice in the October 21, 2009 issue of the Federal Register that "Size Standards Methodology" is available on its website at www.sba.gov/size for public review and comments. The "Size Standards Methodology" White Paper explains how SBA establishes, reviews and modifies its receipts based and employee based small business size standards. In this proposed rule, SBA has applied its methodology that pertains to establishing, reviewing, and modifying a receipts based size standard.
<p>We invite you to review the proposed rule and submit your comments. The proposed rule explains how to submit your comments to SBA. We recommend that you comment through the Federal eRulemaking Portal: www.regulations.gov. Follow the instructions there for submitting your comments. The SBA does not accept comments submitted by email.</p>
<p>The deadline for submission of comments was December 12, 2011.</p>
<p>This is for information only. Originally posted as RIN-3245-AF27 (incorrectly).</p>
<p>You can read/download the proposed rule at Regulations.gov (RIN-3245-AG27; Document ID SBA-2011-0018).</p>

<DESC>This announcement is released by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), Eatontown, New Jersey to provide notification of an Industry Day event to be held Tuesday November 15, 2011 through Thursday November 17, 2011 at the MITRE Corporation facilities, located at 1550 Westbranch Drive, McLean, Virginia 22102. The overall objective of this event is to provide information and augment VA's market research for the upcoming acquisition supporting the Facilities Management Transformation Initiative (VAFM) for web-based commercially available and hosted construction project management capabilities.  VA's intent is to solicit input and expertise from industry leaders in enterprise construction project and construction contract management software capabilities. Software vendors with this experience and expertise are invited to attend the VAFM Industry Day.  For market research purposes in support any resulting acquisition, the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541512, with a small business size standard of $25 million.
	
The purpose of the VAFM initiative is to assist VA with meeting its goal to provide a centralized enterprise level construction and facilities management system for construction management from conception through construction warranty period or other significant milestones; provide automated tools to support reporting requirements as defined by VA Management; eliminate duplication of effort in data entry and management; and promote consistent implementation of business rules for construction and facilities management. VAFM is a part of the Department's Establish Strong VA Management Infrastructure and Integrated Operating Model Major Initiative. 


The event will begin with the VA presenting an overview of their VAFM Initiative and plans for construction project management (CPM).  This is the ONLY session that will be open to all participants.  After the initial session the VA will invite vendors to present demonstrations of their existing construction project and construction contract management software product capabilities in one-on-one sessions with the VA.  These sessions will be between a single vendor and the VA and not open to other attendees. At the end of the CPM Update session or after the one-on-one sessions vendors may provide the VA with any product literature.  The goal of the one-on-one session is to understand how industry solutions handle common CPM practices as well as see how flexible the reporting capabilities are.  During the demonstration period the vendors are encouraged to share any information that would assist the VA in achieving their objectives for the event listed above.  Each vendor will have one 60 minute closed door session with the VAFM team to present their capabilities.  Each session will conclude promptly at the duration of the 60 minute time slot.  There will be an Internet Connection available configured for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).  A secure wireless connection will be available (password to be provided) but bandwidth may be limited.  An overhead projector with VGA hookup will be available.  Vendors are encouraged to bring a backup projection method in case of compatibility issues.  Projection screen will be provided.

As used in this clause--<br /><br />Inverted domestic corporation means a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation under 6 U.S.C. 395(b), i.e., a corporation that used to be incorporated in the United States, or used to be a partnership in the United States, but now is incorporated in a foreign country, or is a subsidiary whose parent corporation is incorporated in a foreign country, that meets the criteria specified in 6 U.S.C. 395(b), applied in accordance with the rules and definitions of 6 U.S.C. 395(c).

The Government may seek any available remedies in the event the Contractor fails to perform in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract as a result of Government action under this clause.</p>

Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND<br />Tajikistan is Central Asia's poorest and most vulnerable state. The country faces increasing security threats, internally and externally. Emerging from Soviet rule in 1991 and a devastating civil war from 1992 to 1997, Tajikistan endeavors to balance the interests of powerful regional forces and maintain stability. Consequently, the Government of Tajikistan (GOT) likely will continue to seek assistance from and cooperation with the United States Government (USG) and other international partners to address critical areas, including economic development and security. The USG's efforts are critical for strengthening the U.S.-Tajikistan bilateral relationship, as well as for Tajikistan's future as a stable and independent state.</p>
<p>Since launching its program in 2003, the U.S. Department of State's (DOS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) has implemented a variety of law enforcement initiatives in Tajikistan. Stemming the flow of narcotics, terrorists, and weapons in and out of Afghanistan is critical to the country's success, the likelihood of long-term regional stability, and the advancement of the USG's efforts against global terrorism. INL's assistance programs strengthen border control and build law enforcement professional and technical capacity. The programs focus on improving the GOT's ability to provide timely, effective, and efficient police services to the civilian population in a conflict-free and human rights-compliant manner. Since 2010, INL has implemented a community policing program aimed to (a) institutionalize the principles and practices of community policing from the top down, by generating understanding of and support for democratic and community-oriented policing among key leaders in the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA), and (b) improve trust between the police and the community from the bottom up, by building collaborative police-community partnerships that are capable of identifying and addressing local problems related to crime, safety, security, and quality of life.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The Community Policing Advisor (CPA) serves as an expert on community policing and provides support, assistance, and advice to INL on the implementation of community-oriented police reform and technical law enforcement assistance programs. The CPA will play a key role in INL program development, in-house program implementation, and oversight of implementing contractors, particularly in relation to community policing.</p>
<p>The CPA advises the MIA on the development and implementation of community policing strategies as the foundation for democratic police reform. The CPA works closely with district-level station commanders, government representatives, and community leaders to establish police-public partnerships, to implement local community policing strategies, and to assist with the education and training of police and community members in community policing principles and practices.</p>
<p>Relationship <br />The CPA reports to the INL Director at U.S. Embassy Dushanbe, Tajikistan. The INL Director will annually evaluate the CPA's performance, based on the duties and responsibilities outlined herein and the interpersonal relationships within the Embassy, host government, and international and local partners.</p>

<p>3) Draft/review technical and programmatic documents, including funding and information memoranda and letters, project work plans, budgets, and reports, talking points, briefing materials, official informal entries, and official cables.</p>
<p>4) Discuss INL's police programs with international and GOT officials at meetings, seminars, and conferences on law enforcement development, police reform, and community policing, as directed; participate in outreach activities with host country and international law enforcement members to increase awareness of INL programs and policies.</p>
<p>5) Design and develop community-policing projects, and oversee and advise on project implementers' work through regular meetings, project document review, and monitoring project activities, including training, establishing police-community partnerships, and community problem solving.</p>
<p>6) Monitor and evaluate program activities' effectiveness and application methods to ensure compliance achievement with acceptable international standards and intended and unintended impact.</p>
<p>7) Establish and maintain collaborative working relationships with police, local government officials, and community members.</p>
<p>8) Advise the MIA on best practices for institutionalizing community policing, including organizational changes, tactical, operational, and strategic planning, training, and community outreach and engagement.</p>
<p>9) Coordinate with the OSCE-led Police Reform Steering Group and Working Groups to ensure INL's community policing initiatives complement police reform activities.</p>
<p>10) Provide professional support and assistance to team members, and build professional capacity of Foreign National program staff through on-the-job training and mentoring.</p>

BACKGROUND<br />The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Criminal Justice Assistance and Partnership (INL/CAP) is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination, and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the US Department of State (DOS).</p>
<p>INL/CAP provides policy guidance and assists to INL program offices in addressing the full range of global criminal justice issues, including police development programs. INL/CAP assists the bureau in developing strategic partnerships with US federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, to support our foreign assistance efforts. <br />Criminal justice assistance is a core component of rule of law development, which is critical to assisting countries in fighting to destabilize crime and corruption and promote good governance. Currently, INL manages criminal justice policy and programs in numerous countries, employing thousands of people in the field to implement these programs. Several US federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies possess specific operational expertise, cultural knowledge, and language abilities that apply readily to INL foreign assistance programs, designed to strengthen the police and criminal justice sectors of partner nations. US federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies participating in INL police development programs will gain unique professional development opportunities for their officers and broaden the exposure and understanding of our foreign partners to best practices in US policing. <br />Purpose<br />The Senior Police Advisor for Strategic Partnership (SPA/SP) is responsible for developing and maintaining an outreach program of strategic partnerships with US federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies and individuals. Strategic partnership is intended to apply specific operational and cultural expertise to INL's law enforcement assistance programs and provide valuable international experience for participating US law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>The SPA/SP provides high-level recommendations to INL/CAP and the program offices, on integrating highly-qualified, senior US police into foreign assistance programs to build capacity in the police and criminal justice sectors of partner nations. The SPA/SP works with chiefs of police and governmental leadership at the US state and local levels. The SPA/SP is the central role in developing strategic partnerships with law enforcement agencies. The SPA/SP develops strategic level plans for how to best support foreign police development using such partnerships.</p>
<p><br />Relationship<br />The Senior Police Advisor reports to the INL/CAP Director, Washington. While in the field, the Deputy Chief of Mission will provide guidance. The SPA/SP will act as team leader frequently for assessment visits, technical assistance visits, and related specialized police functions.</p>
<p>B. STATEMENT OF WORK<br />1) Provide advice on a wide-range of policies and technical law enforcement matters related to US participation in international policing and INL foreign assistance programs directed at capacity building in police and criminal justice sectors</p>
<p>2) Aid in developing concepts of operations, programming elements, and implementation strategies for US participation in capacity building efforts by using broad knowledge of and experience of US law enforcement in the areas of organizational development, leadership, police training and career development, operational planning, ethics and corruption, community policing, civil disturbance/public order management, internal affairs, crowd control, proper use of firearms, defensive tactics, tactical progression, gender based violence, training, of operations, programming elements, and implementation strategies for US participation in capacity building efforts</p>
<p>3) Develop and exercise a broad range of contacts at the command and Chief of Police levels within US federal, state, county, and municipal police agencies, as well as US police professional organizations: introduce US senior police commanders to INL's foreign assistance mandate for police capacity building and develop an in-depth understanding of the interests and specific capabilities of potential partners, including cultural expertise that might be applicable to INL's programs; conduct internal reviews prior to inviting the participation of any potential partners with INL management and legal advisors</p>
<p>4) Serve as senior technical advisor for developing strategic partnerships with US state and local police agencies aimed at applying specific operational and cultural expertise to INL's law enforcement assistance programs; coordinate with INL program officers and overseas posts to conclude the details of foreign police deployments</p>

<SUBJECT>STRATEGIC PLANNING RELATED TO CMS DATA ACCESS INITIATIVES AND INNOVATION

<CONTACT>Lucille Maria Lee, Contracts Specialist, Phone 410-786-5447, Fax 410-786-9088, Email lucille.lee@cms.hhs.gov - Louis P. Anderson, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-786-5564, Fax 410-786-9088, Email Louis.Anderson@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13 (Dollar Threshold of $150,000) a firm -fixed purchase order to Ms. Karen Milgate, 727Chespeake Avenue, Silver Spring, MD 20910. The contractor shall assist the Center for Strategic Planning (CSP) in ensuring the successful development and coordination of initiatives related to maximizing access to CMS data. One specific initiative to which the contractor will provide particular consultation and advice is the Oak Ridge National Laboratory project. Further, the contractor will make recommendations, advise, and assist in the design and development of other related project initiatives upon request. In early 2009, President Obama issued an Executive Order calling for greater transparency in federal programs. As a part of that directive and because of initiatives already underway at CMS, the CTO of HHS has worked closely with CMS to identify develop, and implement initiatives that further those goals. A variety of projects are underway, whose active coordination will ensure a better outcome. One key initiative is being managed by the CSP whereby the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is creating visualization tools, advanced analytics and a variety of prototypes for data delivery and structure. It is the intent of these ORNL projects that they assist CMS in maximizing use of its data more efficiently both internally and externally. Further, as CMS is developing numerous initiatives to innovate in health care, it needs assistance with critical analysis and strategic thinking to ensure maximum effectiveness of these innovations. The contractor shall work with CSP, OIS, the COO's office and the CTO of HHS to ensure active coordination and effective progress on CMS data access projects. Assist with 1) developing a strategic framework and work plan and 2) monitoring the identified projects within the framework. This task will include weekly meetings with affected CMS parties and the CTO, planning meetings with the CTO and other meetings as necessary to ensure effective progress within and across projects. Advise ORNL on use of CMS data, CMS program specifics and provide coordination between CMS and ORNL on specific questions. Meet regularly with ORNL, including 5 face-to-face 2 day meetings and weekly by phone. Meet regularly with involved CMS components to ensure ORNL projects are as effective as possible. Provide advice, critical analysis and strategic planning guidance on innovation initiatives planned by the agency. This ad hoc-style task would allow CMS to utilize the significant knowledge of the contractor on CMS programs and operations on an as-needed, but limited basis for the next critical 6-month period. The consultant's expertise is critical to successfully completing this project. All three tasks require significant knowledge of the operations and data analytics of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Ms. Milgate in her work at CMS and in previous positions has been seen a leader in the field of data analytics, data visualization and policy analysis related to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Her knowledge and skills in these areas are critical for assisting CMS and the CTO of HHS with whom she has worked closely in successful implementation of an overall CMS data strategy. Regarding the ORNL project, Ms. Milgate's knowledge of the Medicare program and Medicare data is critical to provide the staff at ORNL with the knowledge necessary to successfully create the pilots and prototypes envisioned by CMS. This work needs to be provided by Ms. Milgate because she fully understands the parameters of both of these projects, combines deep knowledge of the program and data analytics in a way that no one else can provide. Related to coordination CMS data access projects, Ms. Milgate has worked within CMS to initiate, develop, and impellent several of these projects within CSP and was relied on by other agency component for technical advice for many of the others. She has an ongoing and active relationship with the CTO of HHS, assisting him in pulling together data for the flagship project for HHS - Health Indicator Warehouse. This work within CMS will build on and expand upon that project. Related to ORNL project, Ms. Milgate's expertise is particularly important and because the ORNL staff have little knowledge of health care, Medicare, Medicaid, or underlying data for these programs. Ms. Milgate's unique knowledge of these programs will successfully complement the technology and analytic skills of the CMS ORNL partners. All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address and must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) System. CMS program officer shall make a determination of what would constitute equivalent expertise. The period of performance is May 2 - September 30, 2012. The NAICS code is 541611.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Needles. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection by MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR). It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The Government will make a single selection for each of the following MMESO AORs:</strong>
<p><strong>1. MMESO North</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. MMESO South</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. MMESO West</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. MMESO Pacific</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. MMESO Europe<br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR) for which a quote is submitted, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<br />This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is Oct 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. Point of Contact: Ms. Toni Massenburg, MMESO North, Team Leader, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil, 202-782-3663, or Ms. Varnia Bryant, MMESO North Clinical Analyst, varnia.c.bryant.ctr@us.army.mil. 202-782-3666.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Needles. Within MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $2,060,178.75. Estimated annual demand per Area of Responsibility is approximately MMESO North: $411.868.79; MMESO South: $561,463.40; MMESO West: $571,662.35; MMESO Europe: $319,315.83; and MMESO Pacific: $195,868.38. This forecast is based on historical Prime Vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, the top fifty four (54) line items of the total one hundred and seventy eight (178) line items, account for 82.9% ($1,707,119.43) of the total volume in sales ($2,060,178.75) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 5 products. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ms. Toni Massenburg, Team Leader, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil or Ms. Varnia Bryant, varnia.c.bryant.ctr@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO North via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>Vendor who does not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for each MMESO AOR based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO North reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. A vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. The vendors who meet the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The fourteen (14) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br /><br /></span></strong>1. Vendor must provide a line of Needles products that includes at a minimum the specific products identified below for disposable, sterile, single-use, disposable Conventional and Safety Needles appropriate for all age patients including a variety of gauge sizes and lengths as follows: gauges ranging from 18G to 25G, lengths from 5/8 to 1 &frac12; inches; regular, short, and intradermal bevels as follows:<br />a.<br />ITEM DESCRIPTION<br />18G X 1 &frac12;" SAFETY NEEDLE<br />21GX 1 &frac12;" SAFETY NEEDLE<br />22GX 1" SAFETY NEEDLE<br />23GX1" SAFETY NEEDLE<br />25GX 5/8" SAFETY NEEDLE<br />* Operational usage items are included in this list of Conventional and Safety Needles</p>

Vendors must identify these safety features of their Safety Needle products and provide literature to support this in response to this RFIAQ with initial submittal. <br />5. Vendor must achieve a high standard of manufacturing quality for medical Needles to ensure patient comfort and enable practitioners to accurately deploy and extract fluids with a syringe. During the product development process, needles are subjected to flexure, tensile, and puncture tests to reach this required level of production consistency.<br />6. Vendors must have Needles that adhere to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO): 7864:1993 Sterile needles for single use requirements and provide documentation that the products are sterile, have expiration dates on the packaging, and the contents of the package can be aseptically delivered to a sterile field.<br />7. Vendor must provide Safety Needles that can be activated with a one-handed technique and be of such a design that the safety feature cannot be deactivated /disabled before, during or after activation. <br />8. Vendors must have package labeling of the Needle product line that clearly indicates the size, gauge and length. <br />9. Vendor must provide Needles with a standard hub that will fit all luer lock and luer slip syringes creating leak proof seals, and that have a semi-transparent needle-hub for easy visualization of flashback per standards.<br />10. Vendor must provide needles that are ground and honed with a double-bevel design to provide a comfortable and accurate injection. The thin and ultra-thin walled design insures the needles provide more comfort with an increased flow rate.<br />11. Vendor must have an identified customer service representative available for on-site assessment, on-site instructional sessions (in-services), and on-going clinical support as required at no cost to the government for the Needles product line. A vendor must provide a list of customer service representatives with initial submittal. A vendor who cannot provide representatives to support these requirements will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />12. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA for the Needles product line. Vendor must provide DAPA number with initial submittal or provide documentation that DAPA has been applied for with response submittal.<br />13. Vendor must have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Needles or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements. Vendor must provide documentation to support agreements with initial submittal. <br />14. Vendor must submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for all MMESO AORs.<br />15. Vendor must identify with initial submittal which MMESO AOR(s) they intend to submit quotes for. Vendor will not have an opportunity to change MMESO AOR(s) during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.<br /><br />Phase II Acceptability Evaluation Clinical Performance<br />Clinical Performance Requirements <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO North, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO North via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process. All vendors must send the MMESO North verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor. Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for the clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. One box of safety needles (minimum 50 each) of sizes and lengths listed below are to be provided as samples to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>ITEM DESCRIPTION<br />18G X 1 &frac12;" SAFETY NEEDLE<br />21GX 1 &frac12;" SAFETY NEEDLE<br />23GX1" SAFETY NEEDLE</p>
<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. Each evaluator will evaluate each Needle product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)- Completely Unacceptable, two (2)- Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3)- Partially Unacceptable, four (4)- Acceptable, and five (5)- Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization. Vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those Vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection for each MMESO AOR will be based on best price. Vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO North, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately twelve (12) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below.<br />1. Clinician Safety - (OSHA Blood borne Pathogens Standard 29CFR 1910.1030). The safety feature is an integral part of the device built into the needle, activates easily and automatically and is not an accessory. This feature of the device provides prevention of accidental needle sticks.</p>
<p>2. Clinician Safety - (OSHA Blood borne Pathogens Standard 29CFR 1910.1030).The safety feature allows or requires the worker's hands to remain behind the needle at all times. This feature of the device provides prevention of accidental needle sticks.</p>
<p>3. Clinician Safety and Patient Safety - (OSHA Blood borne Pathogens Standard 29CFR 1910.1030) There is a clear and unmistakable change (audible or visible) that occurs when the safety feature is activated. This safety feature is in effect before disassembly and remains in effect after disposal. This feature of the device provides prevention of accidental needle sticks.</p>
<p>4. Clinician Safety - (OSHA Blood borne Pathogens Standard 29CFR 1910.1030). The needle's hub fits evenly/equally to all luer lock and luer slip syringes. This feature of the needle hub fits all luer lock and luer slip syringes without the need to purchase a special syringe.</p>
<p>5. Patient Safety and Comfort - (OSHA Blood borne Pathogens Standard 29CFR 1910.1030). The bevel of the needle is sharp enough to penetrate the area of the body or the object intended and prevents drag. The device must have minimal penetration and drag force to reduce pain and provide a quick and easy injection.</p>
<p>6. Clinical Safety - (OSHA Blood borne Pathogens Standard 29CFR 1910.1030). The design of the needle safety feature enables comfortable, safe clinical use including use while wearing gloves. The design of the safety feature must be safe, and easy to handle while wearing gloves for provider comfort and effective use.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, vendors who are found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs.<strong> Pricing must be received at the MMESO North by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Pricing should be provided for each MMESO AOR based on a committed volume of 80% of the total volume in sales of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. Vendor quotes will contain separate pricing for each MMESO AOR(s) that was identified in Technical / Company Requirements above. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for each MMESO AOR. Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected for each MMESO AOR.</span></p>

<DESC>This solicitation is for a hazard fuels reduction project on the Beartooth Ranger District of the Custer National Forest for approximately 119 acres. <br />The Main Fork Rock Creek (MFRC) Hazardous Fuels Reduction Project is a continuation of the District's hazard fuels program to provide reduced wildfire intensities through vegetation treatments and reduced fuel loading. <br />The MFRC units are south of Red Lodge, Montana. These treatments are intended to reduce potential wildfire intensity on National Forest System lands adjacent to highly popular and heavily used recreational campgrounds located up the Main Canyon Rock Creek along Forest Road #2421 and near Highway 212. The project objectives are to reduce wildland fire intensities through reducing hazardous fuel loading, facilitate safer evacuation of the public and access to the area by firefighters, and protect values at risk (e.g. municipal watershed, infrastructure at developed campgrounds).
<p>The project is located on the Beartooth Ranger District on the Custer National Forest, Carbon County, MT. The MFRC units are approximately 12 miles south of Red Lodge, Montana. See attachments for a general vicinity area map and unit map.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only RFQ; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. RFQ number RFQ-KS-12-00014 is applicable and is issued as a request for quotation. The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular. The requirement is "Full and Open Competition" with a NAICS Code of 334516 (Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing) and a size standard in millions of dollars $6.5. <br /><br />EPA Region 7 is seeking to procure the YSI Inc brand satellite telemetry systems that are compatible with EPA's existing YSI Inc. brand water quality monitoring equipment such as hand held units, data loggers, sondes, multi-parameter probes, cables and an inventory of replacement parts. EPA Region 7 will use this new equipment as interchangeably with existing equipment and will use many of the items to repair or modify existing hardware. Over the past several years, several hundred paired turbidity readings and bacteria samples were taken by EPA Region 7 with YSI sondes, in order to derive a statistical relationship between bacteria and turbidity. The use of a different manufacturer's sondes would require Region 7 to repeat field collection, laboratory analysis, and data assessment at a significant expense, and would ultimately set the project back a year or more. Additionally, EPA is entering into a joint long-term project to integrate their system with the U.S. Geological Survey`s YSI Inc. telemetry real-time system in the greater Kansas City area. It is essential to the success of this joint effort that the EPA and USGS systems meet exacting standards of compatibility beginning with identical telemetry field equipment, since EPA may install additional EPA sondes on USGS probes.<br /><br />The selection resulting from this request for quotation will be made on the basis of the lowest priced technically acceptable quote from responsible quoter who meets the minimum requirements. Once the Contracting Officer has decided to whom an order will be issued, a unilateral order will be issued using an Optional Form 347. A purchase order will be in existence once the Contracting Officer has signed the order. Wherever the words offer, proposal, offerors, or similar terms are used in this solicitation or in any applicable provision, they shall be read to mean quote, quotation, quoter, vendor or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotation not a Request for Proposal or an Invitation for bid. Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on the basis of information furnished by the quoter that demonstrates that they meet the Minimum system requirements. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the quote. Telephonic inquiries will not be accepted. Quotes must be mailed and are due on March 23, 2012 at 12:00 PM Central Saving Time (CST) along with the completed representations and certifications, providing the business size, e-mail address, Dunn and Bradstreet number, CAGE code and Federal Tax ID number. In addition, quoters must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database at www.ccr.gov to be considered for selection. Quoters are required to submit completed copies of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3 and its ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with their quotes. FAR clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders, Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The following clauses within 52.247-64 are applicable to this acquisition: 52.219-14, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.222-39, 52.222-41, 52.246-4

<p><br />DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: <br />REFER TO THE ATTACHED STATEMENT OF WORK.<br />HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this project, interested parties must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration and demonstrate that they are qualified to provide the supplies/services by providing a brief (20 pages or less) Technical and Price Quotes by 12:00 PM, ET, MARCH 15, 2012. Technical quotes must include: (1) Specific approach in meeting requirements outlined in the Statement of Work and compatibility of system/process with existing agency configuration. (2) History (current or within the last 18 months) of projects similar in scope and nature, with specific references (including project identifier/contract number and description, period of performance, dollar amount, client name and current telephone number). References will be checked to validate the information provided and to determine reliability/dependability. (3) Key personnel (those who would have the primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the project) with relevant qualifications and specific experience. <br />Cost Proposal: provide Firm Fixed-Price "broken out by labor hours, labor category, materials, and other direct costs".

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The submitted quotes will be evaluated based on the following technical components and specifications listed below in the Product Information/Salient Characteristics section.

Please see attachment with information regarding information security and a Business Associate Agreement (BAA), both of which apply to this solicitation and requirement.  Please include the following information in your quotes.

2.	Detailed information regarding monitoring services.
3.	Firm-fixed pricing for (150 EA) ZIO Patch long-term cardiac rhythm monitors and Arrhythmia monitoring services (Brand name or equal products quoted must meet or exceed the product information/salient characteristics listed below):
4.	If your company is exempt from a (BAA) because you are a HIPAA healthcare provider and Covered Entity, please provide documentation for review.

Product Information/Salient Characteristics
The Zio Patch is a long-term cardiac rhythm monitor that provides continuous monitoring for up-to-14 days (significantly longer than the time period of a typical Holter). By providing a longer time period of continuous recording, the Zio Patch improves the likelihood of capturing arrhythmias and provides for an equal or higher diagnostic yield versus other devices on the market.  Diagnostic findings are not reported until the device is returned to Rhythm Technologies and will be posted to their website for review and printing for final interpretation by Cardiologist.  

The Zio Patch is indicated for use on patients who may be asymptomatic or who may suffer from transient symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, light-headedness, presyncope and syncope, shortness of breath, anxiety and fatigue. As with all iRhythm products, the Zio Patch is 100% recyclable. No part of the device will end up in a landfill, minimizing the impact of disposable devices on the environment.

Intended Use:  The ZIO Patch will be applied to upper left chest of patient and to be worn up to 14 days to monitor patient's rate and rhythm. It is a diagnostic tool to aid physicians in the treatment of their patients with arrhythmia problems or to rule out arrhythmia problems due to various symptoms.

Benefits:
o	Easy for patient to use:  Apply and remove device from chest after monitoring period.  The ZIO Patch has no electrodes, lead wires or telephone to wear as with "real time" event monitoring devices.  
o	Can be worn during showering (though not to be immersed in water completely as in swimming), thus eliminating breaks in monitoring period.
o	Depending upon indications for use, can save considerable costs with use of the device and less ordering of more expensive monitoring device for real time monitoring.
o	The patient simply puts their used Zio device in the postage paid envelope provided with their device and drops it in the mail.
o	Offers longer periods of monitoring than standard 24 or 48 hour monitors to capture infrequent but questionable symptoms of palpitations, dizziness, etc.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.

<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Expectation the Government has that the Offeror will be able to successfully complete the required effort; and 3. Price. Award will be made to the responsible technically acceptable offeror who conforms to all of the solicitation requirements, has affirmatively demonstrated responsibility through past performance and has the lowest total evaluated price. Technical and past performances, when combined, are significantly more important than price. All offeror's shall provide with their quotation, descriptive literature, brochures, and technical proposal response. Offerors must submit sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc., in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment of the proposed unit. Award will be based on technical acceptability (acceptable or not acceptable), past performance (confidence or no confidence) and then price.

The technical proposal response shall include a written line-by-line response to each paragraph number of the purchase description. A simple statement of compliance is not acceptable. Where the technical literature demonstrates that the proposed unit meets the requirement of a specific purchase description paragraph you may reference that page and paragraph of the technical literature in your technical response in lieu of restating it. Past performance will be evaluated based on information submitted (three (3) recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items) in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and information obtained from the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), including information linked to FAPIIS such as from the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) and the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The Government reserves the right to use performance information from other sources such as Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), Fee Determining Officials, or commercial sources. Offerors shall be given an opportunity to respond to the information. The total evaluated price will be calculated as follows:<br />(1) The evaluated price will be the unit price proposed multiplied by the specified unit quantity (e.g. 1 EACH),<br />(2) For the option units where there is a quantity range, the evaluated price will be the unit price proposed multiplied by the maximum quantity in that range.<br />(3) The sum of all CLINs (Basic Year and Options) will represent the total evaluated price.<br />(4) Offeror's are advised that the evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise such options;<br />FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with Alternate I.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>Addenda to 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i) Technical Capabilities<br />a. Experience<br />b. Understanding of the Requirement<br />ii) Past Performance<br />iii) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities and its sub factors, are significantly more important than past performance and price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract from this combined synopsis/solicitation.&nbsp; Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior services than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior services. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES- The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Proposal. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Part 5 of the SOW. The government must receive enough information in a proposal to make a determination that the Offeror can complete the defined work or the proposal may be considered non-responsive.</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE - The Offeror shall complete Part I of the Past Performance Questionnaire and e-mail the questionnaire to Government and private sector technical representatives responsible for the past/current contract. The Points Of Contact (POC) shall be instructed to electronically complete Part II of the questionnaire and e-mail the entire questionnaire to Contract Specialist, Mindy Smith at smith.mindy@dol.gov no later than March 9, 2012 at 9:00 am, EST. Please note, that the Past Performance Questionnaire will not be a part of the resultant contract.</p>
<p>PRICE- The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the contract line items listed above. Pricing must be provided separately from your technical proposal.</p>
<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY</p>
<p>FACTOR I - TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES-The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work. <br />Sub factor a. EXPERIENCE-The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT- The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the Statement of Work, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II - Past Performance-The The Government will evaluate past performance of three (3) current or previous contracts for relevancy (within 3 years) with at least one (1) previous or current contract with relevancy within the past 12 months based on how well the contractor performed on projects of similar dollar value, scope, and complexity. Offerors are advised that the Government may use past performance information obtained from centralized past performance databases and sources other than those identified by the Offeror and the information obtained may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision. The absence of past performance data will be rated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Contracts listed may include those entered into with Government agencies or private sectors. For contractors with no relevant corporate past performance, the Government may take into account information regarding the past performance of predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant past performance, or subcontractors that will perform key aspects of the requirement. The Government will evaluate the Past Performance Elements specified in the Past Performance Questionnaire.</p>
<p>FACTOR III - PRICE The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities and for Factor II-Past Performance follow. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor III, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:</p>
<p>Factor I- Technical Capabilities, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale:<br />Outstanding-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Acceptable-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable-A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Factor II-Past Performance, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale:</p>
<p>Low Risk-Little doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>Medium Risk-Some doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>High Risk-Significant doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p>Unknown Risk-Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no favorable or unfavorable evaluation significance.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: <br />Factor I, Technical Capabilities and its sub factors are significantly more important than Factor II, Past Performance and Factor III, Price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor III, Price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Vendors who are exempt from the Service Contract Act must certify that the exemption applies using FAR 52.222-41, 52.222-48, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification.</p>
<p>Quotes must be received by Mindy Smith, Contract Specialist, no later than 9:00&nbsp;am (EST) on March 12, 2012. Quotes will be accepted by fax at (304) 256-3332 or e-mail at smith.mindy@dol.gov. Electronic quotes must be submitted in a format compatible with Microsoft Office 2003 or Adobe. Pricing must be sent as a separate file.

<DESC><p><strong>THIS MODIFICATION IS BEING PUBLISHED SOLELY FOR FORMATTING ISSUES WHEN ORIGINALLY POSTED ON 7 MARCH 2012.&nbsp; ALL INFORMATION PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED ON 7 MARCH 2012&nbsp;REMAINS UNCHANGED.<br /><br /><br /></strong>NAICS CODE: 541712<br /><br />FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514<br /><br />TITLE: Advanced Software Engineering Technologies for the Software Producibility Initiative<br /><br />ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial Announcement<br /><br />FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-12-06<br /><br />CFDA Number: 12.800<br /><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:<br /><strong><br />Background<br /></strong><br />On behalf of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OASD(R&amp;E)), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is seeking white papers for Advanced Software Engineering TechnologieS (ASETS) as part of the Software Producibility Initiative (SWPI). SWPI is an ongoing program with the overall goal of improving the Department of Defense's (DoD's) ability to design, build, test, and sustain software-intensive systems that are large-scale, high complexity, highly reliable, and operate in relevant military environments, which meet mission critical requirements, safety critical requirements as well as exhibit predictable behavior.<br /><br />Within SWPI, the ASETS BAA focuses on discovering and adapting cutting-edge ideas in computer science, mathematics, and information science to the production of military software. ASETS seeks to improve the producibility of software-intensive systems that directly support the Warfighter and operate in the most demanding military environments. Producibility may be defined as the capacity to design, produce, assure and evolve software-intensive systems in a predictable manner while effectively managing risk, cost, schedule, quality, and complexity [1]. Previous efforts have provided the foundation for future work by investigating specification of complex requirements; "correct-by-construction" software development; scalable composition; high-confidence software and middleware; system architectures for network-centric environments; technologies for system visualization, testing, verification, and validation; and model-driven development approaches.<br /><br />The ASETS BAA is weapons-system agnostic because software cross-cuts nearly all DoD weapons systems. The ASETS BAA is seeking innovative ideas to improve the DoD's ability to develop and sustain software systems; the ASETS BAA is not requesting effort to perform the sustainment. ASETS research concentrations are organized by software gap areas to focus investigations on software technology and to provide solutions that are broadly applicable to many systems.<br /><strong><br />Capability Gap<br /><br /></strong>The DoD strives for superiority in a complex operational environment composed of heterogeneous and ever-evolving pieces such as sensors and processing hardware, software, and wired and wireless communications infrastructure. To achieve superiority in this dynamic environment, the DoD invests in fully networked and maximally-capable sensors and platforms at the cutting edge of performance. Software has emerged as a key enabler of capability and flexibility in DoD systems. Software is essential to providing a vast range of military capabilities by playing a fundamental role [1] that deepens, broadens, links, and integrates diverse system elements.<br /><br />A pervasive DoD challenge is the production of software that provides the Warfighter superior and affordable military capability in an environment where hardware and sensor technology is rapidly advancing and systems' performance demands are ever-increasing. The Government Accountability Office has identified the increasing scope of software development as a contributing factor to poor acquisition program outcome [2]. OASD(R&amp;E) has identified the need for advanced software engineering technology to enhance the producibility of software in this environment with the goal of speeding the delivery of affordable capability to the Warfighter and sustaining it. Specific needs are discussed in the description of Research Concentrations Areas below.<br /><strong><br />Objective<br /></strong><br />White papers are being solicited for innovative approaches within the concentration areas listed below. Of interest are advanced software engineering technologies that harness cutting-edge ideas in computer science, mathematics, and information science to enable production of large-scale software-intensive systems with improved quality and performance, decreases in cost and development times, automation of labor-intensive and error-prone processes, increased reliability, and easier integration and sustainment. Proposed ideas should be candidates for advanced technology development and have an established theoretical basis. Techniques solely involving management and business processes are specifically excluded, as are efforts to sustain software systems.<br /><br /><strong>Research Concentration Areas</strong>:<br /><br />White papers are welcomed in the four technical areas listed below. Cross-cutting proposals are also welcome, but should be identified as such. Proposals should focus generally on technology that enables the production of broad classes of software and not solve implementation-specific problems.<br /><br /><strong>Technical Area 1: Distributed Processing / Multi-core Processing<br /><br /></strong>Investigate approaches that address the production of systems that use parallel or distributed processing. The DoD lacks the ability to quickly, accurately, and affordably optimize software in heterogeneous, multi-core environments that are dynamic and continually evolving.<br /><br />Future growth in computing performance will have to come from software parallelism that can exploit hardware parallelism [3]. The need for robust, general, and scalable parallel software approaches presents challenges that affect the entire DoD computing ecosystem. These systems range from large, distributed processing enterprises (including clouds) to self-contained embedded platforms such as aircraft where deterministic behavior and real-time control are essential. The environments include heterogeneous processing, and diverse communications channels with characteristics (e.g., latency and packet-loss) that vary over six-orders of magnitude. The National Academy of Sciences report entitled "The Future of Computing Performance" [3] identifies five main challenges to increasing performance and energy efficiency through parallelism:<br /><br />1. Finding independent operations.<br />2. Communicating between operations.<br />3. Preserving locality between operations.<br />4. Synchronizing operations.<br />5. Balancing the load represented by the operations among the system resources.<br /><br />Promising research areas include, but are not limited to: partitioning approaches that address data dependencies, data locations, algorithmic dependencies, computational dependencies, and read and write dependencies; rethinking programming models so that programmers can express application parallelism; managing asynchronous behaviors; methods for resource allocation, load balancing, data communication, and synchronization of interactions; new programming languages with appropriate compilation and runtime support; graphical design approaches; executable design specifications; transactional memory approaches; and shared memory management approaches.<br /><br /><strong>Technical Area 2: Completeness, Development, Testing, and Sustainment<br /><br /></strong>Investigate approaches that address the ability to design, produce, and assure large and complex software systems. In very large and complex systems, the DoD lacks the ability to quickly, accurately, and affordably check for the completeness of software with respect to design, the correctness of the software with respect to domain models, the traceability of software features to requirements, and the validation of system function against rigorous sets of performance and reliability standards.<br /><br />A large DoD system can have in excess of 100 million lines of code, 100s to 1,000s of configuration items, and diverse implementations (programming languages, operating systems, middleware, etc.). These systems may be built by different and geographically distributed developers and require nearly continuous modification and upgrades. It is not unusual to have simultaneous, conflicting requirements (performance, real-time processing, bounded failure recovery, security, etc.) in systems that are not identified until late stages of testing or integration. Further, unanticipated errors and conditions may arise from imprecise estimations during design, possible-but-unlikely inputs or stimuli, changes in the physical environment, operator error, or novel usage. All these factors make it very difficult for the DoD to design, produce, and assure software.<br /><br />Promising research areas include, but are not limited to: formal specification; syntactic and semantic methods; improvements to code quality (including formal verification); scaling improvements for formal methods; representations and quantification of uncertainty and risk; innovative theorem provers and satisfiability solvers; static and run-time analyzers; model checking approaches; innovative formal methods for architectures, refinement, and change traceability; characterizations of functional and non-functional properties; integration of specification or model-based methods with measurement-based methods; improved fault-tolerance, robustness, adaptability; sampling and measurement; runtime verification; forecasting system behaviors; thresholds to alert users; control recommendations; fault isolation; runtime code replacement or modification; identification of faults induced by hardware, residual software defects, or external influences; and testing and evaluation techniques.<br /><br /><strong>Technical Area 3: Instrumentation and Monitoring<br /><br /></strong>Investigate approaches that enable quantitative and data-driven decisions about the production of software. The DoD lacks the ability to quickly, accurately, and affordably develop quantitative and data-driven descriptions of software that provide programmers and project leaders in Government and industry the same understanding of large and complex software-intensive systems. This gap leads to diverging or speculative assessments of project progress and system performance. It also hampers the test and evaluation community in designing and making assessments of sub-system and system performance that can clearly distinguish software performance from hardware performance.<br /><br />Promising research areas include, but are not limited to: instrumentation and monitoring of software and firmware with minimal invasiveness; multi-scale and multi-modal approaches such as representations, abstractions, and composition of models and measurements; integration of specification-based methods and measurement-based methods; quantification and representation of uncertainty; dynamic identification of performance metrics; and code visualization.<br /><br /><strong>Technical Area 4: Legacy Software<br /><br /></strong>Investigate approaches that address evolution and interoperability of older software with newly produced or upgraded software. The DoD lacks the ability to quickly, accurately, and affordably integrate newly-developed code with older code and verify system performance. This thrust is distinct from the other technical areas because it pre-supposes that the developer will encounter software that was not designed to be easily upgraded or changed. Further, this thrust is not seeking approaches that improve the ability to sustain the software in a particular system. Approaches must investigate novel techniques that could be adopted in the future to sustain many different systems.<br /><br />The sustainment phase of software is critical for DoD systems given the long life of these systems. Software sustainment can be characterized as either (1) the modification or correction of existing code or (2) development of new functions or performance improvements that provide increased capability to enhance weapon system relevance [4]. Further complicating the task is that systems must integrate or interoperate with older or "legacy" systems whose code may have been written in an obsolete language, in a different context, or with different assumptions. It is prohibitively expensive to rewrite these legacy applications and "wrapping" them has fundamental performance limits for the distributed environment.<br /><br />Promising research areas include, but are not limited to: methods for extracting the architectural information, sub-components, and flow and inheritance graphs from object code; reverse engineering; identifying functional and nonfunctional requirements in legacy code; traceability link recovery; deriving interface requirements between legacy and new code; methods for conversion and refactoring legacy code into new structured programs; and alternate frameworks for the examining legacy code.<br /><br />References:<br />[1] National Academies Press "Critical Code: Software Producibility for Defense"<br /><a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12979">http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12979</a><br /><br />[2] GAO-11-233SP, Assessments of Selected Weapon Programs, 2011. <br /><a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-233SP">http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-233SP</a><br /><br />[3] National Academies Press "The Future of Computing Performance: Game Over or Next Level?" <br /><a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12980">http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12980</a><br /><br />[4] National Academies Press "Examination of the U.S. Air Force's Aircraft Sustainment Needs in the Future and Its Strategy to Meet Those Needs" <br /><a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13177">http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13177</a><br /><br />II.

OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />All responses to this announcement, including whitepapers, must be submitted via email to: Steven.Drager@rl.af.mil<br /><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:<br /><br />1. CRITERIA: White papers and/or proposals will be evaluated through a peer or scientific review process using the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance, to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: <br /><br />(1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit of the Proposed Approach - 1a) The extent to which the objective of the proposed approach provides improvements over already-existing approaches, if any, that are currently used to reach the same objective as the proposed approach. 1b) The extent to which the description of the proposed technical approach is distinct from other currently-researched or emerging approaches, if any, with the same objective. (2) The merit of measurement techniques for tracking progress on the proposed effort. (3) Return on Investment - The extent to which the offerors proposed approach provides a return on investment including metrics and measurement techniques to validate the claims. (4) Transition Likelihood - The merit of the offeror's proposed path to broad adoption of the proposed approach. (5) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge. (6) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness. (7) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.<br /><br />2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.<br /><br />VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:<br /><br />1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.<br /><br />All offerors submitting white papers will only be contacted via email by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.<br /><br />2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS: <br /><br />The offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek,<br />Michigan 49037-3084, telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a<br />copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data<br />Agreement, with your Proposal.<br /><br />3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, the offeror will be given complete instructions on the submission process for submitting reports required during the life of the contract.<br /><br />VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:<br /><br />Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:<br /><br />TPOC: Steven Drager<br />Telephone: (315) 330-2735<br />Email: Steven.Drager@rl.af.mil<br /><br />Questions of a contractual/business nature shall be directed to the cognizant contracting officer, as specified below:<br /><br />Lynn White<br />Telephone (315) 330-4996<br />Email: Lynn.White@rl.af.mil<br /><br />The email must reference the solicitation (BAA) number and title of the acquisition.<br /><br />In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement.

<p>All questions regarding this notice are to be submitted in writing via E-mail or Fax. All questions submitted to this office are subject to be posted in this notice along with the appropriate response(s). Vendor identities will not be disclosed.<br /><br /><br />Q &amp; A:</p>
<p>1. Can you please clarify the difference between an Overhaul and Overhaul/Remanufacture?</p>
<p>A: Overhaul and Remanufacture are used in interchangeably in this requirement. Overhaul/Remanufacture is defined as: An end item overhaul is the action taken to return the end item to a like-new condition. This overhaul process is consistent with re-manufacture as set forth in FAR 22.1003-6(a)(1).</p>
<p><br />2. Can you please expand on an Off-Load/Overflow Requirement because the work is performed organically? <br /><br />A: Work performed organically means that we (the Air Force) do have the capability to perform the overhaul/remanufacture. It is considered an<br />Offload/overflow requirement because the estimated quantities listed are not the total requirements of the Government activity, but are estimates of requirements in excess of the quantities that the activity may itself<br />furnish within its own capabilities. Except as the notice otherwise provides, the Government shall order from the Contractor all of that activity's requirements for supplies and services that exceed the quantities that the activity may furnish within its own capabilities.</p>

<DESC><p>This announcement serves as notice the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Systems Directorate at Los Angeles AFB, CA anticipates issuance of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) solicitation for a study, to include concept development and component level demonstration, on the feasibility and affordability of using existing and/or narrowly modified commercial protected satellite communication (SATCOM) systems to support future protected MILSATCOM needs. SMC will consider alternative protected MILSATCOM design concepts that modify the placement of processing functions associated with a robust, Lower Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) and anti-jam frequency-hopped spread-spectrum system (FHSS) between the space, terminal and/or ground segments relative to traditional highly protected MILSATCOM system designs. SMC is soliciting proposals to architect, prototype, and demonstrate specific elements of such protected MILSATCOM design concepts focused on improved life-cycle affordability. SMC has identified elements of the space, ground, and terminal segments for risk reduction activities. This acquisition will be conducted on a Full and Open Competitive basis in accordance with the procurement procedures outlined in FAR 35.016, "Broad Agency Announcement." This effort involves the concept development and demonstration of tasks over three phases: Phase I: Design Concept Development and Demonstration; Phase II: Design Concept Demonstration and Validation, and Phase III: Interoperability Demonstration. Phases II and III will be options under any resulting contract. The anticipated period of performance for all three phases, if exercised, is 24 months. Multiple awards are possible. The Government may award some, all, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement subject to the availability of funds.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by SMC. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 517410. The small business size standard is $15 Million. Small and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to participate. Foreign firms are advised they will not be allowed to participate in this effort. The anticipated release of the BAA solicitation will be before the end of Mar 2012.</p>
<p>FBO.gov will be utilized to transmit the BAA and all attachments, thus, there is no longer a need to submit written requests for a copy of the BAA as previously instructed in this synopsis.</p>

The Government shall issue an award to a single small business using a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), contract on or about 25 March 2012 with a period of performance from&nbsp;25 March 2012 to&nbsp;30 Septemebr 2012.&nbsp;We anticipate posting the solicitation 5 days after posting of this notice. This requirement shall be procured pursuant to the regulatory direction of FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>
<p>The closing date and time for submission of offers shall be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation package, including the Standard Form 1449 and continuation pages and the Statement of Work, shall be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Requests for copies of the solicitation package, or any cumulative parts thereof, by any other means shall not be honored. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for the release of the solicitation package, which should be on or about 7&nbsp;March 2012 for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package and for downloading their own copy of each associative amendment, if any.</p>
<p>All firms wishing to submit a quote subsequent to the solicitation described herein MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as well as the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database or risk their otherwise-timely quote being considered non-responsive regardless of its completeness, timeliness or other salient considerations. Information on CCR and ORCA registrations can be obtained at their respective web sites: http://www.ccr.gov and http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>Response to this announcement is not required. The government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement. The solicitation subsequent to this announcement may be cancelled. After solicitation and prior to award the possibility exists to reject all offers when cancellation is clearly in the public interest. This announcement does not obligate the Government to pay for any bid/quote preparation costs.</p>
<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 (10 AUG 2005) the following applies:</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of quotes, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Gregory Oneal, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: gregory.oneal@us.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer, 2Lt. Jason Hatcher email: jason.hatcher.1@us.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The "TSI NSN Listing" available at the TSI website has been modified to reflect the current TSI Program NSNs, associated&nbsp;request for proposal (RFP) numbers and annual demand quantity (ADQ) as of 8 Sep 2010.<br /><br />The "Requisition History" (by zip code)&nbsp;for all TSI NSNs was posted 2 Sep, however, review of the data indicates duplicate listings of certain requisitions have inflated said data. It is anticipated a corrected requisition history will be posted by COB 10 Sep 2010.<br /><br />The TSI Program solicitations are currently under Agency reviews. When a firm release date for the LTC RFPs and TSI Contractor solicitation are determined, a notice will be posted via FBO.

<p>There was proprietary information in the incorporated subcontracting plan that was erroneously released in the award announcement and DLA Land &amp; Maritime requests that&nbsp;anyone who has accessed this data to please shred or destroy the information.</p>

<DESC>DLA Land and Maritime intends to solicit a total of 29 tires as split award candidates under four of the eight TSI&nbsp;LTC Vendor solicitations. The tires, to be identified in the pending solicitations, will request pricing at 100%, 70%, 50% and 30% of the total requirement&nbsp;and be evaluated on a Lowest-Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) basis. <br /><br />If the Government is able to determine split award pricing (70/30 or 50/50) fair and reasonable, a split award will result. If the Government is unable to make a fair and reasonable price determination for either allocation of the split(s), the Government will execute a single award to the LPTA offeror, assuming that single, 100% award price is determined fair and reasonable.

THIS IS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southwest is seeking comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for a large scale construction project (exceeding $25 million) within the Yuma, AZ area. 

This is a new procurement. It does not replace an existing contract. No prior contract information exists. The target award range is $25-$100 Million. This project consists of constructing a Field-Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP) training facility with Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) training facilities to support the new Joint Strike Fighter Aviator Landing Skills Program.
 The work includes the following primary items: flight control tower and air operation facility, fire and rescue shelter, aircraft fueling areas, aircraft maintenance shelter, taxiway, airfield pavement, storm drainage structures, infrastructure including non-potable water supply (drilling of wells) and storage, multiple miles of electrical and communications wiring, fire protection system, and access roadway and parking, and incidental related work. This project fulfills critical requirements to support the establishment of the JSF squadrons at MCAS Yuma. The facility is to be built in a remote location on the Barry M. Goldwater Range (BMGR) that contains general range-related debris and Materials Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard (MPPEH).
 The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes are 236220 & 237310 with Small Business Size Standards of $33.5M and $33.5M respectively. 

The use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is being considered for this project pursuant to Executive Order 13502, Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects (February 6, 2009).

A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.
 Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law.
 Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.

<DESC>This announcement was originally posted from 1 February 2012 through 22February 2012. It is reposted from 28 February 2012 through&nbsp;9 March 2012. This is a sole source announcement. No solicitation will be prepared or made available. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SSC Pacific) Code 22530 intends to award a sole source, cost plus fixed fee contract to Lockheed Martin Information Systems and Global Solutions (LM IS&amp;GS) for research and development to expand upon the existing Lockheed Martin technology named Web Information Spread Data Operations Module (WISDOM). Specifically the effort will: (a) Mature the state of the art in social media collection, analysis, and predictive modeling where applicable, (b) Conduct experiments with operational organizations such as the Joint Special Operations Task Force Philippines (JSOTF-P) analyzing violent extremism, and (c) Transition the capability to the Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) program of record (POR) for operational use by intelligence analysts and desk officers. This contract will be awarded without providing for full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements). No other source, Government or industry, other than LM IS&amp;GS is currently capable of providing the required technology and demonstrated capabilities to address the nascent field of sociocultural analytics. LM IS&amp;GS WISDOM technology has demonstrated the infrastructure robustness and analytical adaptability to handle rapidly expanding sociocultural data sources and quantity. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Responsible sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which will be considered by the agency. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The total estimated value of this award is $9 million. Questions concerning this sole source contract action may be directed to Jacob Ward, Contracts Specialist at jacob.ward@navy.mil. Phone: (619) 553-4504. The deadline for responses to this notice is 9 March 2012.

<DESC>FAR 8.405-6 (a) (1) (i) (B)
<p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on behalf of The Department of The Treasury has awarded a Sole Source award to "Executive Information Systems" for the purchase of SAS software maintenance for the migration of systems from the Alpha ES-80 to the HP Intel Itanium BladeSystem. The period of performance shall be from date of award through September 30, 2012. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The IRS on behalf of The Department of The Treasury has a continuing need for SAS software since it is the only software that is fully compatible to running on the HP Intel Itanium BladeSystem and running other SAS products. Specific features, requirements and compatibility with the existing applications, data models and reporting capabilities are requirements for the Departmental Offices. No other software other than SAS will fully operate within Alpha ES-80 or the HP Intel Itanium BladeSystem. Executive Information Systems Inc. is a GSA Schedule holder and is the only schedule holder for the SAS product and is the only SAS authorized reseller of the SAS product.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids. The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action.</p>

<p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has awarded a Sole Source award to "Executive Information Systems" for the purchase of SAS software maintenance for the Statistics of Income (SOI) Distributed Processing System (DPS) (SOI-DPS). The period of performance shall be from date of award through January 14, 2013. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The IRS has a continuing need for SAS software since it is the major statistical software used in support of SOI-DPS. SAS is used for the statistical studies SOI performs for Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis, as well as for Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. No other software other than SAS will operate within the SOI-DPS environment / production system. Executive Information Systems Inc. is a GSA Schedule holder and is the only schedule holder for the SAS product and is the only SAS authorized reseller of the SAS product.</p>

<DESC>It is the government's intent to extend task order FA8823-11-F-0001 80 days to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This extension is necessary to continue to meet mission critical requirements, mitigate the impact of personnel turnover, and to support transition to competitively award a follow-on task order. The period of performance for this extension is 11 February 2012 through 30 April 2012. This extension is strictly for the continuation of Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) to the Space and Missile Systems Center, Space Logistics Directorate and related space organizations. This extension will support the Air Force's immediate need to bridge a gap in service from the end of the current A&amp;AS task order, which expires 10 February 2012, to the award of the follow-on task order. This notice is for informational purposes only and is not a request for competitive proposals. As stated above, the Air Force intends to award the extension described herein to the incumbent contractor.

In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C), the circumstance restricting competition for this acquisition is that only one source is capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required because the services are unique or highly specialized. The modification to extend services is necessary to prevent a disruption in services. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The time and expense associated with a new contractor would be cost prohibitive. No other company except ICF can provide services which are unique to ICF.</span></p>
