<DESC>The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) under the U.S.
Department of Transportation is being replaced by the Research and
Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) and the Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which were authorized
on Nov. 30, 2004 when President Bush signed the Norman Y. Mineta
Research and Special Programs Improvement Act.  RSPA had two contracting

Examples of research issues:
·Conduct of regional climate sensitivity analysis for the transportation sector.

·Synthesis of existing risk assessment data specific to transportation infrastructure and operations.
 
·Identification of data and analysis gaps for future research.

·Assessment of existing transportation planning tools and their ability to appropriately incorporate climate change data.

·Identification of challenges to marine and inland waterway transportation from changes in precipitation patterns or sea level rise.

Increasing Energy Efficiency and Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions
This research will examine opportunities for mitigating the GHG impact of the transportation sector.  Projects may consider the potential for conservation through more efficient transportation practices or through new or emerging technologies, the substitution of non-fossil fuels, or other methods.  Research may pertain to any aspect of reducing the sector’s GHG emissions, from increasing consumer acceptance of new technologies to overcoming challenges in technology deployment.

Examples of research issues:

·Examination of economic, social, and institutional factors in transportation energy consumption.

·Identification of options for improving the freight system’s efficiency.

·Identification of transportation “best practices” that reduce GHG emissions.

·Assessment of potential alternative fuels (including diesel) for light or heavy-duty vehicles and the challenges they pose. 

·Assessment of improving incentives to increase operational efficiency.
  
·Identification of challenges to the introduction of advanced vehicle technologies, such as fuel cells.

Decision making Tools and Their Applications and Modeling
This research will focus on developing and improving analytical tools that could support transportation decision making at all levels of government and in the private sector.  Modeling work may involve fiscal instruments and other market mechanisms, vehicle and fuel characteristics, transportation system design and operation, or other research areas.  Energy models currently in use for decision making, such as the Department of Energy’s National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), represent some important aspects of the transportation sector (e.g. consumer demand and off-highway surface modes); however, they do so at a macro level and operate primarily at the national scale.  Research in this area should provide a better basis for evaluating a broad range of multimodal transportation-related options at different geographic scales.

Examples of research issues:

·Examination of the rate of deployment for alternative fuel infrastructure.

·Development of tools needed to supplement existing tools and processes.

·Improvement of consumer demand reduction and mode selection models to support metropolitan transportation planning. 

·Development of consumer-based models needed to better predict future fleet mixes.

·Modeling of incentive policies to speed the introduction of new, efficient power trains for locomotives, trucks, vessels, or any other vehicles.

·Improvement of availability of GHG emissions data by mode through modeling or other techniques.

·Development of models and methodologies for estimating societal costs and benefits of transportation technologies or policies.

<DESC>The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) under the U.S.
Department of Transportation is being replaced by the Research and
Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) and the Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), which were authorized
on Nov. 30, 2004 when President Bush signed the Norman Y. Mineta
Research and Special Programs Improvement Act.  RSPA had two contracting
offices, one at RSPAs Washington Headquarters and one at Volpe National
Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge, MA.  For the most part, the
Volpe contracting office will be the new contracting office for RITA,
and the former RSPA Headquarters contracting office will be the new
contracting office for PHMSA.  Though the Bureau of Transportation
Statistics has been reorganized under RITA, its procurement activities
will continue to be serviced by the contracting office in the Office of
the Secretary of Transportation.  More reorganization details are
available at http://www.dot.gov/affairs/DOT2805.htm.s to increase sys tem's performance.  Typical system performance measurements (light fixture response rate, number of light commands, health status reports, etc.).  Examples of installations at airports - describe what the system consists of and any special design/installation procedures.  Airfield Lighting Cable - Special airfield lighting cable that incorporates both power and control communications.  Any special installation or connection details.
