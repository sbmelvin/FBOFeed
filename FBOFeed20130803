<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Division of Product Quality Research (DPQR) has an important regulatory role evaluating the quality, purity, and strength of active pharmaceutical ingredients in drug products. DPQR's regulatory research role includes the scientific evaluation of drug impurities and drug degradation products to ensure the quality of pharmaceuticals. The ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) systems are advanced systems designed to detect, resolve, and quantitate impurities in drug products. DPQR is in need of service maintenance for a combination of eight UPLC and HPLC systems.<br /><br />PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Asheville, North Carolina has a need for a Immunostainer  System to include associated components and on-site training, warranty and telephone support.  

Scope of Work- Immunostainer System

The automated immunohistochemistry instrument must meet the following minimum criteria:
"	Continuous random access capability that allows: 
"	Simultaneous processing of up to five batch runs
"	Addition of new batches of slides is possible at any time 
"	Each batch or tray runs independently of the others
"	Each batch or tray starts and completes independently 
"	After addition of new batches of slides, the instrument must be able to run the new slides while maintaining the progress of the slides already being run on the instrument. Slides already running on the instrument must not be delayed in order for the latest batch to "catch up". 
"	Bar code capability for on-board reagents and patient slides
"	Capacity to perform on-board dilution of chromogens and enzymes
"	On-board refrigeration for up to 2 heat-labile chromogens or enzymes.
"	Performance of multiple IHC staining protocols, with different primary antibody incubation times, on the same tray and in the same run.
"	Allows multiplex IHC staining in a simultaneous, not a sequential manner. The instrument and chemistries must allow for incubation of two to five primary antibodies in a single incubation step as well as detection of these antibodies using a single detection cycle (secondary, then tertiary, then chromogen). The entire cycle for detection of 2 to 5 antibodies must complete in less than 3 hours without operator intervention.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source Firm Fixed-Price Contract (FFP).
<p>The Food and Drug Administration's Office of Acquisition and Grant Services intends to issue a sole source award to Life Technologies for Custom Lyophilized Salmonella, Salmonella Enteritidis multiplex assay, qPCR Assays and custom sample prep trays. This will be for a quantity of the following;<br />&nbsp;<br />Salmonella Ultimate Multiplex Assay kits<br />Pre-clarification trays <br />Custom TaqMan FDA Salmonella Enteritidis multiplex assay (96 assay beads per kit)<br />Shipping and Handling</p>
<p>The Division of Microbiology in the Office of Regualtory Science is evaluating two custom-lyphilized qPCR Assays. The first assay is the Custom-Lyoplized Salmonella Ultimate Multiplex qPCR with Custom Sample Prep Tray. This that is a multiplexed real-time PCR assay for the detection of general Salmonella directly from food pre-enrichments. The Custom Sample Prep Tray provides a pre-clarification step to achieve a better DNA prep which permits more efficient detection of Salmonella. The second assay targets a specific type of Salmonella (S. Enteritidis) and consists of a Custom-Lyophilized Salmonella Enteritidis multiplex qPCR kit. This is a multiplexed real-time PCR assay for the detection of Salmonella Enteritidis directly from food pre-enrichments (mainly eggs). The assays were developed as part of a collaboration and are currently being used in an ongoing study. Using other types of similar assays may have inherent risks associated with their use. This risk includes the need to repeat all preliminary studies with the new assays, since they are not the same and would yield different results.<br />&nbsp;<br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The proposed action is for the purchase of a subscription for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1. The estimated dollar value for this action is not to exceed $47,000. This will result in a purchase order. The projected award date is August 12, 2013.<br /><br />Interested parties may submit a capability statement by August 7, 2013, 4:30pm EST for considerations by the agency. Responses must be sent to Juana Quinteros via email at juana.quinteros@fda.hhs.gov. All correspondence must reference FDA-RFI-1119241.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
