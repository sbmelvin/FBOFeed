<p><br />This is a Presolicitation Notice. A previous Sources Sought Notice was posted on March 9, 2015 as Solicitation W31P4Q-15-R-0077.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command proposes to issue a contract, sole sourced to Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), 350 Lowell St., Andover, MA, CAGE: 05716. This effort is in support of the United States (US) PATRIOT Program through The Lower Tier Project Office (LTPO) having a requirement for a new contract to support PATRIOT Schoolhouse Radar Upgrades for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016. This upgrade effort includes the manufacture, testing, production and installation of Configuration 3 (C3) Radar Upgrade kits as well as the installation of the Radar Digital Processor (RDP), P/N 13659149, and Radar Receiver Group (RRG), P/N 13639894, kits in order to re-manufacture the four C2 Radars and raise them to the C3+ configuration. Period of Performance is to be 36 months. Anticipated award date is June 30, 2016.</p>
<p>This requirement is based on Statutory Authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A)and (B), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".</p>
<p>Raytheon IDS is the only known source, which possesses the knowledge and expertise necessary to remanufacture the existing radar that can build, install and test the new configuration radars to the stringent performance requirements and meet the required delivery schedule to support the PATRIOT Program training requirements. Due to the fielding requirements, which necessitates delivery to begin the third quarter of FY20, it is not feasible to procure this effort from another source.</p>
<p>Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which will be considered by the agency. These documents should be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Stephanie Caldwell at the following email address: stephanie.l.caldwell.civ@mail.mil.</p>

To realize its mission, ODEP promotes the adoption and implementation of policy strategies and effective practices that are supported by evidence and data that appear to show positive results in the employment of people with disabilities. To that end, ODEP conducts research to identify and develop effective policies and practices, conducts outreach to share this critical information, and provides technical assistance to all levels of government, service providers and non-governmental organizations, and employers in both the public and private sector. ODEP's stakeholders include:<br /><br />&bull; Individuals with disabilities and their families; <br />&bull; Private employers and their employees; <br />&bull; Government employers and their employees;<br />&bull; Federal, state, and local Government agencies; <br />&bull; Educational and training institutions; <br />&bull; Disability advocates; and <br />&bull; Providers of services to individuals with disabilities</p>
<p>Strategic communications are vital to conveying ODEP's policy strategies and outputs, effective practices, technical assistance resources, research activities and other policies and activities to its various stakeholders and the general public. ODEP utilizes numerous outreach and communications strategies to inform and engage their stakeholders in all phases of its work from research and policy development to the dissemination of information about effective policies and practices. By involving stakeholders, and intermediary groups that represent or work with stakeholders (e.g. professional and business associations), ODEP ensures that the policies and practices developed and promoted are responsive to the stakeholders' needs and effective in improving employment opportunities for people with disabilities.</p>
<p><br />All of ODEP's policy-focused teams conduct public engagement and outreach activities around their respective policy issues, utilizing a wide variety of communication strategies to do so. ODEP's Policy Communications and Outreach (PC&amp;O) Division coordinates with these teams and with the Departments' Offices of Public Affairs and of Public Engagement to ensure message consistency within ODEP and in support of the Secretary's priorities. PC&amp;O is responsible for providing communications support for the Assistant Secretary and other ODEP senior leadership and assists in preparing (i.e., writing and editing) briefings, other reports and materials used for planning, management and reporting. PC&amp;O also coordinates with OPA to respond to media inquiries and assists in preparing the Assistant Secretary or others for interviews and other communications activities such as blogs, press releases and presentations. PC&amp;O oversees speechwriting and the creation of materials for publication under the name of members of ODEP senior leadership. PC&amp;O manages the content on ODEP's agency website, which contains regularly updated information about all of ODEP's efforts and serves as a portal to other ODEP-sponsored websites such as those maintained by its various technical assistance centers. PC&amp;O also compiles and distributes a weekly electronic newsletter to its more than 50,000 small business subscribers and monthly electronic newsletter (Business$ense) to approximately 50,000 small businesses. PC&amp;O has the responsibility for conducting the annual National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM) campaign and provides logistical and communications support to other events and activities that arise in response to current events or leadership priorities and commitments. All of these efforts, and more, that are managed, performed or coordinated by PC&amp;O are considered ODEP's Strategic Communications and Outreach (SCO) activities.</p>
<p><br />Each of these initiatives is ongoing and recurring and requires continuity from one year to the next. The successful vendor needs to possess communications expertise and understand the disability employment landscape and the nuances of communicating with its varied stakeholders.</p>

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.  

One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p><br /><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF or Task Force) is an independent, volunteer panel of national experts in prevention and evidence-based medicine. Since its inception in 1984, the Task Force has worked to improve the health of all Americans by making evidence-based recommendations about clinical preventive services and health promotion. These recommendations for adults and children address screening tests, counseling about healthful behaviors, and preventive medications. <br /><br />Task Force recommendations focus on interventions to prevent or decrease the severity of disease, and they apply only to people without signs or symptoms of the disease or health condition under consideration. USPSTF recommendations address services offered in the primary care setting or services to which patients can be referred by primary care professionals. The Task Force makes recommendations to help primary care clinicians, patients, and families decide together whether a particular preventive service is right for an individual's needs.</p>
<p>For additional information on the Task Force, its procedures including opportunities for public comment, and all documents (e.g., research plans; systematic evidence reviews and recommendation statements), please visit the USPSTF Procedure Manual at http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf08/methods/procmanual.htm.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to establish a Scientific Resource Center (SRC) to support AHRQ in its role of supporting the USPSTF in its work to make evidence-based recommendations on clinical preventive services.</p>
<p>The objectives of this task order include establishing a Scientific Resource Center to support and coordinate some of the governing functions of the USPSTF and many of the overall activities associated with all USPSTF topics including:</p>
<p>1. Conflict of Interest<br />2. Horizon Scanning<br />3. Topic Nomination &amp; Topic Development<br />4. Methods<br />5. Liability Insurance</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project requirements</strong></p>
<p>Below is a summary of the key anticipated requirements for this acquisition. Other tasks, including but not limited to, quarterly progress reports and monthly progress calls, will be in the final requirement. Respondents will be expected to have the ability to complete all tasks described below.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Conflict of Interest Policy</strong></p>
<p>Implementing Updated Conflict of Interest Policy</p>
<p>Over the past two years, the USPSTF has worked to revise its conflict of interest policy focusing on disclosures and mitigation of potential conflicts for USPSTF members. The contractor shall be responsible for implementing the updated USPSTF COI policy which includes:</p>
<p>&bull; Developing a secure and confidential online tool to collect the COIs and update the tool and related materials before each TF meeting and before the start of new topics.<br />&bull; Distributing the secure online disclosure links to USPSTF members prior to each in-person meeting, summarizing all potential conflicts and providing results in an excel spreadsheet and individual word documents.<br />&bull; Participating on a phone call with AHRQ staff to review the process, timeline and updated information before the deployment of the disclosures.<br />&bull; Reporting the progress of this work as part of the monthly progress reports to AHRQ. This should include a discussion of the challenges and successes of implementing the COI policy.</p>
<p>The contractor also shall complete the update of the COI policy which will include: developing a template for publically reporting conflicts of interest (USPSTF members' disclosures and mitigation activities) and developing a COI policy for others who work with the USPSTF such as investigators at Evidence-based Practice Centers, peer-reviewers, AHRQ staff and other contractors. This activity should include a presentation to the Task Force during one of its in-person meetings to seek approval for an updated COI policy. In-person meetings are scheduled in March, July, and November each year.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Implement Horizon Scanning</strong></p>
<p>The Task Force has developed a process for conducting a literature watch ("LitWatch"), consisting of a timely search of selected journals for new evidence that could influence either USPSTF topics currently under review or the timing of an update of a USPSTF topic.<br /><br />The Contractor shall implement horizon scanning by conducting a LitWatch quarterly and reporting the results according to a template. The Contractor should report the progress of this work as part of its monthly progress reports to AHRQ. This should include a discussion of the challenges and successes of horizon scanning.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Topic Nominations &amp; Topic Development</strong></p>
<p>The contractor shall manage the receipt, initial assessment, processing, and tracking of topic nominations and reconsiderations received via the USPSTF Web site (www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org). Depending on the volume, the contractor shall conduct an initial assessment of nominations and reconsiderations on a monthly or bimonthly basis. The initial assessment could include documenting how new nominations fit within the scope of the USPSTF and how they may be related to previous USPSTF recommendations. <br /><br />The contractor shall follow the established processes for topic nominations in order to assist the Topic Prioritization Workgroup, a subset of USPSTF members, in determining the final disposition of nominated topics. The SRC may need to contact the nominating organization for further specification. A Topic Nomination Background document should be prepared for each topic nomination/reconsideration. <br /><br />Once a newly nominated topic has been selected, it is prioritized by the Task Force. Because the Task Force has as its goal to update all topics every 5 years, each year it reviews all active topics that will need to be updated. In general, new topics and reconsiderations will be prioritized during this yearly prioritization process by the Task Force. The Task Force first decides if an active topic will stay active or if it should be inactivated or referred to another organization.</p>
<p>The contractor shall follow the existing processes for assisting the Topic Prioritization Workgroup in prioritizing the active queue of topics. The contractor should design a Topic Brief with the goal of providing the necessary background information for the Topic Prioritization Workgroup and USPSTF to review, discuss, and vote on a final disposition for active topics and to assist with prioritizing all active topics. <br /><br />The contractor shall plan on preparing Topic Nomination documents and leading a conference call with the Topic Prioritization Workgroup at least one month prior to each Task Force meeting (February, June and October) to determine final disposition and recommendation for all nominated topics. This information will be presented to the full Task Force for a vote at each in-person meeting (March, July and November).</p>
<p>The contractor shall develop Topic Briefs for all topics eligible for updating (topics published 2-3 years earlier). The contractor shall plan on preparing for and participating on monthly conference calls with the Topic Prioritization Workgroup to determine the final disposition for all active topics.</p>
<p>In addition, the SRC will participate in topic prioritization. The SRC shall update and implement the USPSTF's process for soliciting feedback on the annual priority rating of all topics in its active queue. The goal of this process is to have a prioritized list of 12-20 topics each year whose review will begin over the next 12-18 months. The SRC shall facilitate involvement of USPSTF members, partners and other identified stakeholders in the process. The SRC shall develop and distribute an online tool to collect the feedback from the different stakeholders. The SRC shall provide a summary memo and provide results in Microsoft excel and word. <br /><br />The SRC will use the USPSTF content management system to document and track the full library of USPSTF topics focusing on the status of newly nominated topics, the prioritization of active topics, and the timing of updates.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall implement the processes associated with topic nomination, prioritization and development. The Contractor should report the progress of this work as part of its monthly progress reports to AHRQ. This should include a discussion of the challenges and successes of topic nominations, prioritization and development.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Support and Development of Methods to Advance the Work of the USPSTF</strong></p>
<p>The SRC will help to identify and prioritize potential methods projects for the USPSTF. The Contractor(s) shall be asked to conduct 1 - 3 research methods projects each year to advance the work of the USPSTF; the number will depend on the size (small, medium, large) of prioritized projects.</p>
<p>Small methods research projects typically involve commissioning an expert consultant to provide scientific support and feedback to the USPSTF on a specific issue of concern. This would likely be in conjunction with one of the USPSTF methods work groups.</p>
<p>Medium-sized projects would involve a small team (1 Investigator and 1 Research Associate) to provide support to a USPSTF work group in a targeted area. The work conducted by the project team would likely include activities such as a (non-systematic) literature review, audit of current processes, or development of a conceptual framework. The project deliverable would be a brief report or update to the Procedure Manual.</p>
<p>Finally, large methods research projects would be the most intense in terms of staffing and development of new or more extensive methods guidance. A typical team would include two Investigators along with a Research Associate who are devoting a fairly substantial effort to the project with the intention of authoring a methods manuscript in conjunction with a USPSTF work group or a more extended final report.</p>
<p>The contractor shall participate in monthly calls with AHRQ staff to discuss methods activities. The contractor may be asked to attend conference calls with the USPSTF Methods Workgroup, a subset of USPSTF members, to discuss specific methods projects. The Methods Workgroup meets monthly. The contractor may be asked to present research findings and or/proposed updates to the full Task Force at one of its in-person meetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Assist the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in Purchasing Liability Insurance</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor shall secure the services of an insurance agent to work with USPSTF members to review the existing liability insurance policy.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure that the policy meets the current requirements of USPSTF members. While AHRQ staff will review the policy, the USPSTF members will approve the final policy.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall arrange for the Task Force to renew/purchase a one-year policy based on the final approved policy. The Contractor shall monitor the policy and arrange coverage for new members who join the Task Force.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall distribute and collect reimbursement forms and process reimbursement payments for 3 to 16 members for the cost of the policy.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall send a copy of the policy to all current members of the USPSTF.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall respond to any correspondence from the insurance company or Task Force members related to the policy.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide monthly electronic progress reports to the TOO until the policy has been purchased and all Task Force members have been reimbursed.</p>
<p><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> The USPSTF Procedure Manual will be provided with the RFP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated period of performance</strong></p>
<p>July 1, 2016 - June 30, 2021<br />12-month base period with four 12-month option years</p>
<p><br /><strong>Other important considerations</strong></p>
<p>The contractor shall understand the basic principles of evidence-based medicine and prevention, and the methods and processes inherent in making and communicating evidence-based recommendations. They shall help ensure the Task Force is on the cutting edge of the science and processes of methods related to prevention, evidence-based guideline development, and systematic reviewing. They shall ensure capacity to assist in the governance and scientific support of the Task Force.</p>

For all draft recommendations, a disposition table of all citations for additional studies listed in the public comments that includes: the full citation provided, whether the study was included or excluded or not considered in the systematic evidence review (this information is provided as part of the systematic evidence review) and a disposition for the study, e.g., excluded for study design (Letter to the Editor; Opinion Piece; Clinical Guideline, etc.). AHRQ will provide the Contractor with a template for the citation disposition table and suggested codes.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Anticipated period of performance</strong></p>
<p>July 1, 2016 - June 30, 2021<br />12-month base period with four 12-month option years</p>
<p><br /><strong>Other important considerations</strong></p>
<p>Since the mandate for Task Force "A" and "B" recommendations in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), there is increased attention and a change in the type and quantity of stakeholders interested in the Task Force's recommendations. The public comments process is an important aspect of the USPSTF program and it is the primary way that the Task Force expands opportunities for the public and stakeholders to engage in the process. The Task Force believes that its recommendations are more accurate and relevant as a result of the public comment process.</p>

<CONTACT>Kevin J. Parker, Contracting Officer, Phone 508-233-6175, Email kevin.j.parker3.civ@mail.mil - Yvette M. Daltorio, Acquisition Specialist, Email yvette.m.daltorio.ctr@mail.mil
<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) Product Manager Infantry Combat Equipment (PdM-ICE) is conducting market research to identify tropical uniform fabrics, uniform designs, and boots that provide durability and protection, improved moisture management, and reduced dry time in a tropical environment.  The tropical combat uniform includes a blouse, trouser, and boot.   PdM ICE plans to conduct a user evaluation on the most promising materials and end items.
<p>Respondents are encouraged to submit fabrics or uniform prototypes that are suitable for a tropical environment.  PdM ICE intends to use a Government-owned design for the tropical uniform, although end- item designs will also be considered as an alternative to the Government-owned designs.</p>
<p>The primary consideration in development of the new tropical uniform will be improved performance in a tropical environment.  It is expected the tropical combat blouse and trousers will have similar durability and protection as either the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU) or the Enhanced Flame Resistant Combat Ensemble (EFRCE).  In addition fabrics should meet the additional performance attributes listed in Table I, but trade-offs may be considered.  For reference, the MCCUU and EFRCE Product Descriptions are included with this announcement.  Preference will be given to materials that do not deteriorate in tropical conditions (e.g. materials that do not become weaker when wet) and materials that significantly exceed MCCUU durability requirements (e.g. break and tear strength) while meeting weight and dry out time requirements (see Tables I and II - Performance Attributes for Woven and Knit Tropical Combat Uniform Fabrics).</p>
<p>The primary consideration in development of a new tropical boot will be improved performance in a tropical environment.  The new tropical boot shall have similar qualities to the Marine Corps Combat Boot requirements.  The boot must operate within a tropical environment, with performance based upon boot durability.  Submissions shall incorporate innovative designs which utilize fabric and synthetic leathers to increase dry out time, while reducing weight and moisture retention caused by natural leather. Additionally, the tropical boot must be lighter weight and faster drying when compared to the current combat boot.  The outsole must allow for easy removal of mud, debris, and foreign substances.  The Marine Corps tropical boot can vary in height as long as the boot provides ankle support to the wearer.  (see Table III - Performance Attributes Tropical Boot)</p>
<p>Lastly, PdM-ICE is conducting market research to determine if the current Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU) could be flame resistant (FR) treated.  Treatment should be low cost, and could be applied during fabric manufacture, as a post treatment, or in garment form.  Treatment shall not alter appearance, comfort, or durability properties.  The treatment must  meet the vertical flame performance Objective (desired) requirement contained in Table I below.  For reference, the MCCUU Product Description is included with this announcement.</p>
<p>Offerors may submit test data from similar test methods that demonstrate performance of their submitted fabric and/or end item.</p>
<p>INDUSTRY DAY</p>
<p>PdM-ICE will hold an Industry Day from 7-10 January 2016 in Salt Lake City, Utah.  The Government plans to conduct one-on-one meetings with industry.  The purpose of this Industry Day is to exchange information regarding this RFI and the performance requirements, and discuss with Industry their potential materials, garment designs, and boots. Industry must inform PdM-ICE representatives if they are able to supply materials and end-items that could meet these requirements.</p>

<p>Sources Sought Notice. The Army Contracting Command-Warren (ACC-WRN), in support of the Program Executive Office for Ground Combat Systems (PEO GCS), the Project Director - Main Battle Tank Systems (PD MBTS), and the Product Director - Combat Recovery Systems (PD-CRS) is conducting a Sources Sought to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to provide an M88A2 Recovery Vehicle.<br /><br />Clarification of this Action. This request is a Sources Sought. It is an inquiry intended to measure the level of industry interest in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy for potential future acquisitions. The potential acquisitions are for vehicles to be produced in the FY16 through FY20 timeframe and they will be awarded on Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts. This Sources Sought neither constitutes a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation to Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. Additionally, as a Sources Sought, this inquiry does not bind the Government to solicit for or award a competitive contract. Participation in this survey is also wholly voluntary on the part of the contractor, as no reimbursements will be made to any contractor for any costs associated with their participation in the survey. Data submitted in response to this Sources Sought will not be returned. Lastly, participation in this Sources Sought, while important to Army acquisition planners, is neither mandatory, nor is it requisite to future participation by a contractor in this or a similar contract RFP. You may address any part or portion of this Sources Sought. However, the Government reserves the right to solicit for all or parts of these requirements in the best interest of the Government.</p>

<p><br />GENERAL INFORMATION: The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information, we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure, subject to the following:</p>
<p>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend <br />(all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory test, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.</p>
<p>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the <br />data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see Item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.</p>
<p>3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, <br />marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.</p>
<p>4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by respondent or by the Government, shall contain the) "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e:mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends "PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."</p>
<p>5. In any reproduction of technical data or any portions thereof subject to <br />Asserted restrictions, the Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.</p>
<p>6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure to those support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors, consistent with the resources available.</p>

<p><br />Product Description:<br />The M18 is a burning type hand grenade used to generate colored smoke. It comes in four colors green, red, yellow, and violet. The four unique dyes (green, red, yellow, violet) are chemically synthesized to meet the requirements in the applicable specifications. The dyes are mixed with other chemical constituents to create colored smoke mix. To produce smoke grenades, the mix is consolidated into donut shaped slugs and loaded into the applicable body/housing. The smoke mix burns, creating a colored smoke cloud of the color of the dye used in the formulation. The final assembly is called the M18 color smoke grenade and is used as a ground-to-ground or ground-to-air signaling device, a target or landing zone marking device, or a screening device for unit movements.

<p>The FDA is seeking small business sources to determine the availability and capability of small businesses capable of providing the required services. Other than small business concerns are also encouraged to submit capability statements. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-811219- Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance; Small Business Size Standard is $20.5 million.</p>
<p>The NCTR requires preventative maintenance, corrective/remedial maintenance repair service on two (2) Jaeger-Baumgartner Cigarette Smoking Machine (CSM) Systems (JB2090) with an anticipated performance period of a base year with four (4) 1-year option periods. The Cigarette Smoking Machine Systems serial numbers CSM2090-A-032 and CSM2090-A-033 and accessory components.</p>
<p>The Cigarette Smoking Machine Systems will serve the tobacco research needs of the NCTR and collaborative research with the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products (CTP). <br />The Jaeger-Baumgartner 30-port Cigarette Smoking Machines are connected to Vitrocell Systems exposure modules which are set-up for exposing a variety of cell types in addition to a variety of exposure plates (35mm petri dishes, 6-well inserts, 12-well inserts and ALI 3D bronchial cultures. In addition to Vitrocell Systems exposure modules, the Smoking Machines can also be connected to a Vitrocell Systems CO monitor and a Vitrocell Systems side stream smoke exposure chamber. The assorted tobacco smoke exposure set-ups will support projects involving exposing a variety of cell culture types used in genetic cytotoxicity assays to evaluate tobacco smoke generated the Jaeger-Baumgartner 30-port Cigarette Smoking Machine. The Smoking Machines will be used to produce the tobacco smoke used to conduct the studies outlined above to provide needed data to determine the risks associated with exposure to specific levels of whole tobacco smoke, thus filling in data-gaps that exist in risk assessment models. In addition, the equipment allows the FDA to be able to quantify the toxicity of whole cigarette smoke, monitor in real time the CO level and provides the FDA/CTP with data regarding the relative toxicity and biomarkers of harm for tobacco products.</p>

<DESC><br />MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) requirement for a Laser Microdissection Device (LMD) system.</p>
<p>The FDA is seeking small business sources to determine the availability and capability of small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying, and subsequently maintaining, a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer for the items described herein.

<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The NCTR, requires a Laser Microdissection Device (LMD) system with post-warranty service/maintenance options. The NCTR's research involves the study of genetic alterations that occur in tumors and other lesions requires a precise molecular analysis in defined cell populations. Tissues are composed of multiple cell-types that differ from each other by histogenesis and function. Therefore, the use of tissue homogenates does not allow detection of changes in a specific target cell-type. Laser capture microdissection (LMD) provides an easy and rapid method for the isolation of morphologically defined cells and structures from complex tissues. This eliminates the problems of cell-type heterogeneity within tissue samples by providing homogeneous material for the further analysis.</p>

<DESC><div><br />INTRODUCTION<br /><br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is a Research and Development (R &amp; D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources including small and small disadvantaged businesses to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement.</div>
<div><br /><br />BACKGROUND<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>This National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) project is for work related to the contract below:</div>
<div>-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>An Integrated Approach to Understanding Host-Pathogen Interactions, Emory University (Contract HHSN272201200031C)</div>
<div><br />This contract was awarded on a competitive basis for a five year period (inclusive of options) in 2012 for the provision of services utilizing multiple high-throughput &ldquo;omics&rdquo; technologies to generate diverse experimental data, with the goal of developing and or validating computational models of host-pathogen molecular interaction networks and pathways through the analysis and integration of the experimental datasets generated by the high-throughput technologies. &nbsp;The contract was awarded with an initial Base Period of September 30, 2012 to September 29, 2013; and included four one-year Option Periods for a total potential performance period through September 29, 2017. &nbsp;The total potential value of the contract, inclusive of Options, is $19,458,981.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />During the course of this contract, comprehensive systems biology studies involving active experimental malaria infections in non-human primates (NHPs) using several host-parasite combinations over time have been conducted. These studies included the following components: physiological and clinical monitoring, innate and adaptive immune profiling, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, pathogenesis, informatics and computational systems biology and mathematical modeling. Infections were initiated by intravenous inoculation of infectious sporozoites, and the development of blood-stage parasitemia, illness, and recovery stages upon treatment was monitored along with the development and impact of the immune response. Novel assays and procedures have been developed, optimized and implemented to assess NHP immune response to both simian and human malaria parasites in relevant NHP models, including small-new world monkeys (Aotus sp. and Saimiri sp.) and old world monkeys (M. mulatta and M. fascicularis). Comprehensive immunological assays performed in diverse sample types (e.g. bone marrow aspirates, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells) have been established to identify and functional characterize 20-30 cellular subsets comprised of monocytes, dendritic cells, T-cells, B-cells, eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils, and to monitor their potential contribution to the ongoing immune responses observed during the infection. Computational infrastructures for acquiring, analyzing, integrating, and modeling large datasets from omics technologies and immune profiling assays for studying malaria host-pathogen interactions using NHPs have been established.</div>
<div><br />This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the NIAID.</div>
<div><br /><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</div>
<div><br />The purpose of this Research and Development Sources Sought Notice is to discern whether or not there are other contractors, including small or small disadvantaged businesses, capable of and interested in performing the work described herein. &nbsp;The NIAID does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.</div>
<div><br />As a result of this R &amp; D Sources Sought Notice, the NIAID may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) if it deems this necessary and appropriate. &nbsp;THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. &nbsp;However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NIAID shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NIAID&rsquo;s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications of any subsequent requirement.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />The objective of this acquisition is to increase the quantity of labor hours delivered to the Government through the remainder of the current contract, increasing the effort available to demonstrate the utility and value of systems vaccinology for malaria vaccine development with the benefits of established non-human primate (NHP) model systems, validated assays for in-depth immune profiling, and established computational infrastructures for large scale systems biology data analysis and modeling.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /><br />PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</div>
<div><br />The NIAID intends to modify the existing Emory University contract to provide an increase to the required Level of Effort by 7,800 hours. &nbsp;This project aims to demonstrate the utility and value of systems vaccinology for malaria vaccine development with the benefits of established non-human primate (NHP) model systems. This work will build upon: 1) a large body of systems biology data generated on this contract on the natural course of infection, immunity and pathogenesis in Macaca mulatta (rhesus monkeys) infected with Plasmodium cynomolgi sporozoites (multiple strains) as a model for the widespread human malaria pathogen, P. vivax; 2) assays and panels established and validated on this contract for in-depth immune profiling, including panels for assessing cellular phenotypes in macaques, innate cells and multiplex cytokine assays with a panel of custom-defined molecules; and 3) ready access to cohorts of healthy malaria na&iuml;ve rhesus macaques on a daily basis and at selected times for blood testing of clinical, parasitological and immune response parameters. This work will consist of experiments that involve immunizing M. mulatta with irradiation-attenuated P. cynomolgi sporozoites to identify molecular signatures associated with immunity and protection. Clinical baseline, immunization and post-challenge data using multiple high-throughput omics technologies will be generated. Omics data analysis and integration will be performed as well as in-depth immune profiling to assess changes in frequencies and activation status of approximately 30 cellular subsets comprised of neutrophils, monocytes, B-cells, dendritic cells, and T-cells.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /><br />ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</div>
<div><br />The increase in Labor Hours is anticipated to be applied to Option Period 3 (September 30, 2015 &ndash; September 29, 2016) and Option Period 4 (September 30, 2016 &ndash; September 29, 2017), of the current contract.</div>

<DESC><br />Sources Sought Number: HHS-NIH-OD-OLAO-SS-16-010
<p><br />Project Title: Access to Wiley Subscription Services</p>
<p>This is a "Sources Sought Notice". It is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations. The purpose of this notice is for market research purposes and will be used to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform the potential requirement described herein in the statement of work.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>PROJECT TITLE: Access to Wiley's Online Resources</p>
<p>I. Statement of Work<br />A. Background Information<br />John Wiley &amp; Sons provides access to online resources for NIH staff and HHS agency staff served by the NIH Library (DLS), including over 1500 journals in a wide range of scientific, technical and medical subjects; the Cochrane Library; Current Protocols; and select online reference works. Links from PubMed, Web of Science&reg;, and the NIH Library website allow NIH staff to connect directly to the articles on the Wiley website following a search of the various sites. Wiley online resources allow DLS to provide enhanced and timely access to information NIH staff need to perform their work whether they are intramural researchers or extramural program administrators. Feedback from NIH and HHS researchers, clinicians and administrators indicates that the easy accessibility of needed information made possible by providing electronic access to Wiley resources has increased their productive work time, because of the time saved identifying and retrieving relevant articles.</p>
<p>B. Objectives</p>
<p>The specific objective of this requirement requires the contractor to provide the NIH and the HHS agency staff served by the NIH Library (DLS) access to the electronic version of all Wiley journals, the Cochrane Library, Current Protocols, and select online reference works through its web interface. Access will be cumulative for articles published in the journals since 1997 or the first year a journal was offered on the Wiley platform. The contractor is also required to provide access to other databases and journals as outlined under the "specific requirements" section of this SOW.</p>
<p><br />II. Services to be performed<br />A. General Requirements<br />1. Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment and facilities needed to perform the Statement of Work below.</p>
<p>2. All work under this contract shall be monitored by the Project Officer.</p>
<p>B. Specific Requirements</p>
<p>Specifically, the contractor shall:<br />1. Provide the NIH and the HHS agency staff served by the NIH Library (DLS) access to the electronic version of all Wiley journals, the Cochrane Library, Current Protocols, and select online reference works through its web interface. Access will be cumulative for articles published in the journals since 1997 or the first year a journal was offered on the Wiley platform, based upon previous investments.</p>
<p>2. The contractor also shall provide options for acquiring eBooks, online reference works, and backfiles of selected journals. Options should factor in all previous investments in print and digital subscriptions, as well as previous archive backfile purchases.</p>
<p>3. The contractor may also provide options to include all Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies with access to the same resources as identified in this contract.</p>
<p>4. In the event of a major natural disaster (local, regional, national, or international), then in addition to the other rights granted under this Agreement, Wiley will allow DLS to provide access to the Licensed Electronic Products for a maximum of 180 days upon approval which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed after which time an extension may be granted to any otherwise unaffiliated health professional, ("Emergency Workers") and ("Displaced Users") from other institutions that are not included as one of DLS' Institutions but which have been affected by such a disaster ("Emergency Institutions") so long as the DLS has established temporary affiliation with such an Emergency Institution in order to meet the demands of the population affected by the disaster and any healthcare needs resulting from the disaster. For purposes of this Agreement, such Displaced Users, Emergency Institutions and Emergency Workers will be considered Authorized Users of the respective Institution that requests Wiley to provide the access to the Licensed Electronic Products under this clause. Under this clause, Wiley will allow previously unidentified IP addresses that are provided by DLS access to the Licensed Electronic Products.</p>
<p>5. DLS may fulfill interlibrary loan requests in accord with Section 108 of the United States Copyright Law (17 USC Sec. 108, "Limitations on exclusive rights: Reproduction by libraries and archives") and clause 3 of the Guidelines for the Proviso of Subsection 108(g)(2) prepared by the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works.</p>
<p>6. DLS shall retain perpetual access to all subscribed years of resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />C. Government Responsibilities</p>
<p>1. The Government will be responsible for providing an interface via web links for the NIH community to access the Wiley website.<br />2. NIH will be responsible for creating a system to validate security for entrance into the website.<br />3. Upon signature by the Government, the contractor license agreement will be incorporated into the contract.<br />D. Reporting Requirements and Deliverables<br />1. The contractor shall regularly provide the Project Officer with monthly usage statistics for individual journal titles as well as aggregated use data for journals and databases, complying with industry standards such as COUNTER and SUSHI.</p>
<p>2. Monthly usage data shall be broken out separately for NIH and for the individual HHS agencies served by the NIH Library/DLS. Each report should include title, ISSN, eISSN, monthly usage, and YTD usage.</p>
<p>3. Use by selected NIH institutes may also be required when that use is identifiable, e.g. from IP range or log in.</p>
<p>4. A quarterly report detailing all titles being provided through this contract shall be provided. This report should include the title, ISSN, eISSN, publishing status, journal title URL, and any status-related comments.</p>

<DESC>Background<br />The current Parachutist Oxygen Console supplies the Military Freefall (MFF) parachutist with 100% aviator's grade O2 without depleting the volume of oxygen in the parachutist's bailout system (bottle) during high altitude missions. Currently the console is inadequate to support high altitude operation requirements resulting in additional consoles or K Bottles being brought on to the aircraft.
<p>Description <br />Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PdM SCIE), Personnel Airdrop Team, Natick, MA is conducting a market research to locate potential manufacturers and/or suppliers of an Oxygen Console for MFF/standoff parachute operations. The O2 Console will be part of the Army's Parachutist Oxygen Delivery System (PODS), comprised of the Console, the Parachutist Oxygen Mask, Oxygen Bailout Bottles, and an Oxygen Transfer Pump used to fill the O2 Bailout and Console bottles. The PODS O2 Console will support multiple parachutists during the pre-breathe phase of high altitude operations as well as providing supplemental oxygen during the execution of high altitude (13,000-30,000 feet above ground level) parachute operations..</p>
<p>The system should meet the following performance requirements, which contain both Threshold [T] and Objective [O] levels. The objective level is the performance goal, while the threshold level is the minimum acceptable performance short of the goal. These requirements represent the desired increased capability over the current O2 Console performance.</p>
<p>Please see attachment for Threshold and Objective levels.</p>
<p>This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be taken as a future commitment by PdM SCIE.</p>
<p>All interested firms and manufacturers, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information. Information submissions should include available technology, product literature, illustrations, and relevant company background/experience. Available product pricing should also be provided as part of the information submission. All information supplied will be considered confidential, unless otherwise specified by the firm or available from other sources without restriction. Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside of the US Government</p>
<p>Information submissions must be received within 30 days after the date of this post. Responses to this notice should be directed to: Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment, Personnel Parachute Airdrop Team, ATTN: Nina Shopalovich, 15 General Green Avenue, Natick, MA 01760-5057 or e-mail to nina.j.shopalovich.civ@mail.mil.</p>

It is estimated that up to one defective turbocharger and one defective turbo cartridge will be submitted each year for inspection and overhaul/repair. Exact quantities will depend on the cutter availabilities, individual cutter needs, and SFLC warehouse inventory levels.</p>
<p>The requirement is for turbochargers and turbo cartridges to support geographically dispersed WLB-225 "A" class buoy tenders. These parts are designed to conform to, and mate with, the Caterpillar 3608 Main Propulsion Diesel Engine.</p>
<p>The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for this Procurement is:</p>
<p>ABB Turbocharger Co.<br />1460 Livingston Ave.<br />North Brunswick, NJ 08902-1832</p>
<p>The Government will furnish defective turbochargers and turbo cartridges to the Contractor for overhaul. In the event a unit inducted for overhaul is deemed beyond economical repair (BER), an option will be exercised to purchase a new unit of the same type. The option to purchase new may also be exercised when defective units are not available to be inducted for repair, but new units are required to maintain adequate warehouse stocking levels.</p>
<p>Also see attached draft specification, requirement item listing, and delivery dates for each item.</p>
<p>Applicable NAICS codes include: 336611 -- Ship Building and Repairing, 333618, Other Engine Equipment Manufacturing, 333612, Speed Changer, Industrial High-Speed Drive, and Gear Manufacturing</p>
<p>The information obtained from this notice is for market research only.

SECURITY CLAUSES:

Covered Entity- A hospital lab is not required to have a business associate contract to disclose protected health information to a reference laboratory for treatment of the individual.   See 45CFR 164.502(e), exceptions to the Business Associate Standard.


1.	GENERAL
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.
2.	ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
a.	A contractor/subcontrator shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
b.	All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
c.	Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
d.	Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.
e.	The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.
3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
a.	Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
b.	VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.
c.	Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.
d.	The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.
e.	The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.
f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality,
privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.
g.	If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.
h.	The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.
i.	The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.
j.	Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.
k.	Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.


5. INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE
a.	For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities, contractors/subcontractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks. This includes conducting compliant risk assessments, routine vulnerablity scanning, system patching and change management procedures, and the completion of an acceptable contingency plan for each system. The contractor's security control procedures must be equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems. A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COTR and approved by VA Privacy Service prior to operational approval. All external Internet connections to VA's network involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation.
b.	Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA. These security controls are to be assessed and stated within the PIA and if these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII.
c.	Outsourcing (contractor facility, contractor equipment or contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and accreditation (authorization) (C&A) of the contractor's systems in accordance with VA Handbook 6500.3, Certification and Accreditation and/or the VA OCS Certification Program Office. Government-owned (government facility or government equipment) contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require memorandums of understanding and interconnection agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks.
d.	The contractor/subcontractor's system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA. Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the ISO for entry into VA's POA&M management process. The contractor/subcontractor must use VA's POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities. Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the government. Contractor/subcontractor procedures are subject to periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector General. The physical security aspects associated with contractor/subcontractor activities must also be subject to such assessments. If major changes to the system occur that may
affect the privacy or security of the data or the system, the C&A of the system may need to be reviewed, retested and re-authorized per VA Handbook 6500.3. This may require reviewing and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan, Contingency Plan). The Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new C&A would be necessary.
e.	The contractor/subcontractor must conduct an annual self assessment on all systems and outsourced services as required. Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment must be provided to the COTR. The government reserves the right to conduct such an assessment using government personnel or another contractor/subcontractor. The contractor/subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action (this can be specified in the contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no additional cost.
f.	VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or contractor/subcontractorowned equipment or software on VA's network. If non-VA owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or contract. All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment. All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA- approved configuration. Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches. Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE.
g.	All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract.
h.	Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:
(1)	Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
(2)	VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
(3)	VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.
 
(4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;
(a)	The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and
(b)	Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be pre- approved and described in the purchase order or contract.
(c)	A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.
6. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION
a.	The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.
b.	To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's
notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident
(including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or
compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.
c.	With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.
d.	In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other
compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.
7. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH
a.	Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. Â§5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.
b.	The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.
c.	Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:
(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
(2) Description of the event, including:
(a)	date of occurrence;
(b)	data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
(8)	Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
(9)	Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
(10)	Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
(11)	Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected
individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
(1)	Notification;
(2)	One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
(3)	Data breach analysis;
(4)	Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
(5)	One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
(6)	Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.
8. SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING
On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.

<DESC>Notice of intent to extend services. This extension of services is in accordance with FAR 52.217-8 "Option to Extend Services". <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This action will result in a modification to the current contract, FA2835-15-D-0005 with Maratech Engineering Services, Inc, 5 Carriage Lane, Wakefield, MA, for a period of two (2) months. The period of this extension will be from 01 October 2015 to 30 November 2015, and may be designated as two, one month options. This extension is needed to satisfy the Contractor Operated Civil Engineering Supply Store (COCESS) requirement at Hanscom Air Force Base, MA until award of the COCESS follow-on. The COCESS follow-on contract will be competed during the period of the extension. Background: This COCESS located on HAFB supports the efforts of the 66th Air Base Group Civil Engineering Squadron (66 ABG/CE). 66 ABG/CE supports $550M of assets across the base, and solely utilizes the COCESS to purchase the hardware required to remedy work orders for these assets. Items required to remedy work orders range from hazardous chemicals to ceiling tiles, therefore the COCESS must maintain sourcing expertise for a variety of different industries. On average, 66 ABG/CE receives 30 work orders per day, and due to limited staffing primarily responds to only orders designated as emergency or urgent requests, which require 24 hours and seven calendar days lead times, respectively. The COCESS plays a critical role in fulfilling these numerous emergency and urgent work order requests by establishing partnerships with local suppliers to source hardware in these required timeframes. To ensure that hardware on the recurring items list is readily available to 66 ABG/CE, the COCESS maintains an inventory management system which they use to analyze trends in usage of recurring items. The COCESS then uses these trends to forecast future hardware usage. This two (2) month extension of services is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements" as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. An award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays to the Government in fulfilling the Air Force's requirements. It would take approximately four to six weeks for a new contractor to setup and stock a COCESS to meet the needs of Hanscom AFB, and it could take up to three months to establish local vendor lists that are required to meet both competition requirements for non-recurring items and the deadlines required. Furthermore, MaraTech personnel possess Registered Environmental Manager (REM) and Environmental Compliance Assessment and Management Program (ECAMP) certifications, making them to uniquely qualified to store and manage hazardous materials in accordance with Department of Defense and Federal regulations. This extension of services will extend the end date of performance from 30 Sep 15 to 30 Nov 15. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement specific to this extension of services. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this extension. A determination by the Government to extend these services and not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to extend these services. Any responses to this notice of contract action shall be submitted to 2Lt Blake Jones at <a href="mailto:blake.jones.11@us.af.mil">blake.jones.11@us.af.mil</a> and Alissa Turner at alissa.turner@us.af.mil.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Branch, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of ZOC Pressure modules. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 811219 - Instruments and Related Products Manufacturing for Measuring, Displaying, and Controlling Industrial Process Variables. The Small Business size standard is for NAICS 334513 is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Scanivalve Corporation, 1722 N MADSON ST LIBERTY LAKE, WA, 99019-8544, and UNITED STATES. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 8:30 am Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Friday, 13 Nov 15. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The 16 modules are needed to fill a gap in the 250 psid range. If a different type of pressure module is purchased, one or more of the following items will have to be changed in the facility if the new part is not interoperable: facility piping for pressure signals, new module container redesigned and fabricated if the size is wrong, a new module power supply, and changes to the data acquisition system. Accordingly, the ZOC pressure modules manufactured by Scanivalve Corporation is the only product that fulfills our needs without the U.S. Air Force experiencing substantial duplication of cost (or unacceptable delay) that cannot be recouped through competition.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to robert.fahrney@us.af.mil no later than 8:30 am Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Friday, 18 Nov 15. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "FA8601-16-T-0031, Pressure Modules." Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with e-mail ensure only .PDF, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

The Primary Vendor must be accompanied by at least one of his/her Technical Experts. A response to any unanswered questions during the one-on-one sessions will be published on FedBizOpps.gov after the event. The Government is interested in industry feedback for the following areas in helping to validate or revise the acquisition approach.<br />1. Contract Type<br />2. Evaluation Factors<br />3. Period of Performance<br />4. CLIN Structure<br />5. Phase In<br />6. Performance Metrics<br />7. Subcontracting/Teaming Arrangements<br />8.<br />9.<br />10.<br />RSVP: Contractors electing to attend the Industry Day must respond to Regina Belford at (575) 678-1931 with the requested information in the NCIC-III Form 5000 (see attached Microsoft Excel workbook) and one-on requests no later than 4 December 2015.

<p>Safety: As a tri-service Department of Defense Range, White Sands has tested nearly every type of deployable ordnance developed in the United States since 1945. Quite a number of these munitions were deliberately designed to blend in with the terrain, and their presence may not be immediately obvious to the casual observer. Consequently, even though WSMR performs extensive Range Clearance activities, there is no assurance that any area of the Range is truly 100% free of unexploded ordnance. More information concerning unexploded ordnance hazards can be viewed at http://www.wsmr.army.mil/ux/Pages/default.aspx. The contractors are responsible to view the video found at this link under the title, UXO Hazards Video.</p>
<p>Photography &amp; Video Ban: No photographs or videos are allowed on WSMR except in the WSMR museum missile park area.</p>
<p>Lodging Accommodations: There is a hotel located on the main post and it is open to civilians. They currently have rooms available for the required dates. Reservations can be made by calling 575-678-1838. <br />Las Cruces, NM is the closest city to WSMR, NM. The closest WSMR access gate is located off of US Highway 70. El Paso International Airport, El Paso, TX is the closest regional airport. Contractors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with their attendance at the Industry Day. Please visit the WSMR website, http://www.wsmr.army.mil/Pages/Home.aspx, for more information about WSMR. The "WSMR at a Glance 2011" and the WSMR Facebook are also attached for your information. Maps of WSMR are available at: http://www.wsmr.army.mil/testcenter/Pages/WhereWeAre.aspx.</p>
<p>Occasionally, WSMR will block roads (including US Highway 70) in the area for missile tests. <br />Please call the Road Block phone number, 575-678-1178, for recorded updates on planned roadblocks. The information is usually updated each weekday in the afternoon for the following day. Since the actual firing schedule can slide due to any number of circumstances like weather or equipment problems, travelers should also check the recording right before leaving to ensure nothing has changed.</p>

<p>Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Cross Domain Solution (CDS)</p>
<p>Request for Information<br />(Restricted to US Companies Only)</p>
<p>Office: Missile Defense Agency</p>
<p>DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A. Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited</p>
<p><br />1.0 GENERAL INFORMATION<br /><br />These RFI's are Restricted to US Companies Only.<br /><br />As a result of the May 2015 Camp David Summit, the United States Government (USG) agreed to "help conduct a study of GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] ballistic missile defense architecture and offered technical assistance in the development of a GCC-wide Ballistic Missile Early Warning System" (BMEWS). The USG is releasing three Requests for Information (RFIs) for sensors; command, control, communications (C3); and cross domain solution (CDS). This RFI is one of three RFIs for GCC BMEWS. The Respondents may respond to one, two, or three RFIs. Responses to these RFIs will support the USG's recommendations to the GCC for development of a BMEWS.</p>
<p>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Program Element is conducting market research to determine industry interest and capability for development of a CDS that partner nations can purchase through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process to enable their integration with the U.S. Air and Missile Defense Systems and to support a GCC-wide BMD architecture. <br /><br />2.0 BACKGROUND<br /><br />U.S. regional partners are procuring advanced U.S. Air and Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) systems utilizing both FMS and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) programs. The advanced technology resident within these U.S. sensor and weapon systems produces information at the U.S. Classified (Confidential and above) level and determined to be releasable when approved for sale. Based on the classification of the sensor and weapon systems and the data produced, our partners are obligated to properly protect the system, network, technology, and the resultant data produced at the appropriate classification levels. Many regional partners desire to integrate these new U.S. systems into their existing communications architecture which operates at an un-protected/unclassified level of security by U.S. standards. Different security domains will be required between U.S. systems and partner nations to accommodate these different levels of classification. To support the interconnection of different security domains, a CDS, installed and primarily operated by our partners in their facilities, is required between these different security environments to protect Classified Military Information (CMI) in the SECRET//REL domain, protect advanced U.S. technology and allow information from the lower domains (national or unclassified domains) to be transferred up to the SECRET//REL domain and from higher domain (SECRET//REL) to lower domains (national or unclassified).<br />The MDA is investigating FMS CDSs for foreign partners to purchase solely via the FMS process. The successful FMS CDS will be available to U.S. partner nations world-wide, starting with the GCC region. A family of FMS CDSs may be required to support different missions.</p>
<p>3.0 DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>3.1 CDS--CNSSI-4009, "National Information Assurance Glossary", April 2010. Defines a Cross Domain Solution (CDS) as a form of controlled interface (CI) that provides the ability to manually and/or automatically access and/or transfer information between different security domains; CDS typically runs on a trusted operating system.</p>
<p>3.2 FMS CDS-A CDS that is specifically developed for foreign military partners to protect U.S. classified military systems and data and sold via FMS process. A FMS CDS by definition shall be built and deployed in accordance with National Security Agency best practices, Committee on National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI No. 1253) and the associated Cross Domain Solutions Overlay, and DoDI 8510.01 Risk Management Framework.</p>
<p>4.0 FMS CDS CAPABILITIES AND REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />Respondents must incorporate the following capability requirements into their responses. These requirements are provided to Respondents to assist with the process of developing an RFI response.<br />4.1 Operational requirements. The FMS CDS will<br />4.1.1 Reside in partner nation's facilities or platforms and will be operated and maintained by partner nation<br />4.1.2 Be overseen by U.S. personnel in accordance with identified U.S. and partner configuration roles i.e., U.S. will validate configuration management of deployed FMS CDS solutions<br />4.1.3 Operate in high risk environment e.g., operators/participants from third state nations may be present<br />4.1.4 When the solution includes U.S. communication security (COMSEC) and associated controlled cryptographic item (CCI) ensure compliance with DoDI 8523.01, Communications Security (COMSEC) April 22, 2008</p>
<p>4.2 Technical requirements. The FMS CDS<br />4.2.1 Shall protect advanced technologies in U.S. sensor and weapon systems such that technologies are not exposed <br />4.2.2 Shall protect secure U.S. networks that connect with partner nation's networks<br />4.2.3 Shall protect U.S. Classified Military Information (CMI), e.g., protect U.S. SECRET//REL data, such as information contained in Link-16 BMD messages to include, but not limited to, launch point, impact point and space track<br />4.2.4 Shall use National Security Agency (NSA)-approved encryption technology and processes.<br />4.2.5 Shall protect data at the confidentiality level moderate, integrity level moderate, and availability level moderate within an information system<br />4.2.6 Shall have sufficient filtering to prevent spillage of U.S. CMI to other domains (e.g., networks). Data to be filtered includes, but is not limited to, geographic, source, message type, message content, threat classification/identity, and exercise<br />4.2.7 Be designed to be tamper resistant e.g., high probability of detecting and preventing tampering<br />4.2.8 Shall minimize throughput latency<br />4.2.9 Shall maintain domain separation, e.g., "catcher/pitcher" one-way transfer approach applied to each domain <br />4.2.10 Shall be designed for military use and ITAR-compliant (Ref: Category ITAR 13.B4)<br />4.2.11 Shall minimize footprint, since the FMS CDS may be deployed on aircraft, ship, and other mobile/transportable environments<br />4.2.12 Shall not be based on currently fielded U.S. CDSs identified on the UCDSMO UCL list (CAT1)<br />4.2.13 Shall meet RMF requirements for protection of U.S. SECRET//REL data<br />4.2.14 Shall not use removable media, e.g., back-ups, logs and audits shall be sent to different network device</p>

Contractor should consult appropriate authorities and advisors on these matters. Department of Defense military and civilian personnel will not provide advice in these matters.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract
awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some
external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file
a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG
procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable
Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested
parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under
this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The USAID/OTI Somalia program will support the larger objectives of the U.S. Government to promote stability and political transition, and counter violent extremism, in Somalia. The new program will focus on providing assistance to communities newly liberated from the al-Shabaab militant group, providing support to newly-formed regional administrations, and assisting other emergent political priorities related to the Vision 2016 agenda laid out by the international community and the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS).  In close coordination with the State Department representatives, other USAID programs, other U.S. Government actors, UN stakeholders, other donors, and the FGS, and with consideration of U.S. Government priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners to complement broader stabilization efforts and foster positive political change.<br /> <br />The Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Africa Regional Team, and reports to the OTI Africa Team Leader based in DC, while also having dual reporting to the leadership of the USAID Field Office for Somalia. The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be the strategy development, design, oversight and management of OTI's Somalia program. The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors, local government officials, and local beneficiaries.<br /> <br />This post is an senior management position requiring excellent managerial and communication skills, an ability to perform in a complex and highly sensitive political environment, experience in policy formulation and negotiation at the highest levels (government and non-government organizations), and a strong interest in assisting countries in transition. The Country Representative should have extensive management experience (both project and personnel) and understand the basics of grantee and contractor/USAID relationships. The candidate should be able to communicate effectively with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, U.S. Government agencies, and international organization officials. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.</p>
<p>Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including stabilization, counterinsurgency, community-driven development, elections, subnational governance, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, and human rights. Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies or managing program operations in civil conflicts is preferred. Willingness to work alongside military colleagues (both U.S. and non-U.S.) is essential. The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically charged and challenging security environments. Experience in remote project management is highly desirable, as this position is Nairobi-based yet will be overseeing a localized program in Somalia.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Africa or his/her designee, the Country Representative - Somalia will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick-impact programming model. Support to embassies and USAID Missions may include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews, and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate and coordinate in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, mentor and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff, providing regular feedback;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;<br /> <br />&bull;	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees), ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on the implementing partner's performance, budget, and appropriateness of scope in achieving OTI's country objectives, presenting modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract in accordance with USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS);</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that OTI programs and activities are monitored and evaluated, and that lessons learned feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments, security concerns, and other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other pertinent agencies and organizations. Develop and maintain collaborative relationships to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to the in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g. Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Administrative Program Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations, and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)
(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.    (b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.    Solicitation:

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

We are reaching out in hopes to glean crucial input to validate our market intelligence as well as networking and exchange information between Government and the Transient Alert Services industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This information will be used as guidance for the upcoming request for proposal pertaining to an Air Force-Wide Transient Alert sourcing solution which differs from what the Air Force has done in years past.

A TA services contract is needed if there are not enough military support to handle the additional workload. Extensive research specified the types of services that are required in the AF.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These services include: arrival/departure, emergency services, de-icing, towing, tie-down, and maintenance. The Better Buying Power (BBP) 3.0 initiatives target the improvement in the acquisition of services by achieving affordable programs, promoting effective competition, and eliminating unproductive processes and bureaucracy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These goals structure the TA services program and our way forward. We have determined that TA services could support the requirements and opportunities to generate efficiencies in services acquisition. </span></p>

<DESC><strong>Extension of Services through 31 December 2015.</strong><br /><br /><br />Notice of intent to extend services. This extension of services is in accordance with FAR 52.217-8 "Option to Extend Services". <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This action will result in a modification to the current contract, FA2835-15-D-0005 with Maratech Engineering Services, Inc, 5 Carriage Lane, Wakefield, MA, for a period of&nbsp;one (1) month. The period of this extension will be from 01&nbsp;December 2015 to 31&nbsp;December 2015, and may be designated as a&nbsp;one month option. This extension is needed to satisfy the Contractor Operated Civil Engineering Supply Store (COCESS) requirement at Hanscom Air Force Base, MA until award of the COCESS follow-on. The COCESS follow-on contract will be competed during the period of the extension. Background: This COCESS located on HAFB supports the efforts of the 66th Air Base Group Civil Engineering Squadron (66 ABG/CE). 66 ABG/CE supports $550M of assets across the base, and solely utilizes the COCESS to purchase the hardware required to remedy work orders for these assets. Items required to remedy work orders range from hazardous chemicals to ceiling tiles, therefore the COCESS must maintain sourcing expertise for a variety of different industries. On average, 66 ABG/CE receives 30 work orders per day, and due to limited staffing primarily responds to only orders designated as emergency or urgent requests, which require 24 hours and seven calendar days lead times, respectively. The COCESS plays a critical role in fulfilling these numerous emergency and urgent work order requests by establishing partnerships with local suppliers to source hardware in these required timeframes. To ensure that hardware on the recurring items list is readily available to 66 ABG/CE, the COCESS maintains an inventory management system which they use to analyze trends in usage of recurring items. The COCESS then uses these trends to forecast future hardware usage. This one month extension of services is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements" as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. An award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays to the Government in fulfilling the Air Force's requirements. It would take approximately four to six weeks for a new contractor to setup and stock a COCESS to meet the needs of Hanscom AFB, and it could take up to three months to establish local vendor lists that are required to meet both competition requirements for non-recurring items and the deadlines required. Furthermore, MaraTech personnel possess Registered Environmental Manager (REM) and Environmental Compliance Assessment and Management Program (ECAMP) certifications, making them to uniquely qualified to store and manage hazardous materials in accordance with Department of Defense and Federal regulations. This extension of services will extend the end date of performance from 30&nbsp;November 15 to 31&nbsp;December 15. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement specific to this extension of services. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this extension.

<p>TITLE: Multi-Source Analysis (MSA)</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-13-04</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800</p>
<p><strong>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory is soliciting white p963369pers for various scientific studies, analytical tools, algorithm developments, projects, and experiments focused on developing Multi-Source, Activity-Based Analysis capabilities to provide the Air Force the means to better conduct Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Processing and Exploitation Core Technical Competencies (CTC) mission is to lead the discovery, development, and application of technology to enable the processing and exploitation of multi-source ISR data for commanders, decision makers, and intelligence analysts. The volume of sensor data produced is enormous and still growing rapidly; however the ability to process and exploit this data has not been able to keep pace with the sheer volume of data produced. The Multi-Source Analysis (MSA) sub-CTC, which is the intended target of this Funding Opportunity, focuses on the creation of force multipliers for the ISR operators/analysts by developing automated processes to identify, extract, analyze, correlate, and sort multi-source data in order to classify and identify activities, entities and entity-relation networks in the battlespace. It also supports analysts in developing/maintaining more comprehensive situational awareness on an area of responsibility, as well as expertise on a topic in which they specialize. Multi-source exploitation and analysis capabilities are needed to turn data into information for the analyst. The key aspect is to provide automated capabilities to help the analyst more efficiently develop target sets, answer time-sensitive requests for information and produce intelligence analysis reports.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) has an established test-bed facility that provides evaluation, assessment and demonstration of intelligence tools. The Automated Processing and Exploitation (APEX) Center provides a facility for algorithm development and evaluation, analytical studies, on-site and network distributed simulation exercises and demonstration of fusion technologies with real and simulated multiple source intelligence (multi-INT) data. Capabilities include scenario generation, and platform and sensor modeling. Simulators have been developed for various intelligence data types such as Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) information, electronic signals intelligence (ELINT) and measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT). Highly developed multi-INT data fusion systems are available for application to the problem of ground target tracking against a variety of operational scenarios. Analytical tools that quantify established measures of performance (MOPs) are available for target tracking and other applications. In total the APEX Center helps to facilitate a broad range of intelligence capabilities, and fusion technology development.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>The Information Directorate, Activity Based Analysis Branch, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for unique and innovative technologies to explore and develop network-centric, collaborative intelligence analysis capabilities that allows the fusion of multi-INT and data sources to enable accurate, shared, real-time intelligence products that locate and characterize entities, and tracks events, activities, and adversary networks. The key aspect is to provide automation capabilities for the analyst in the development of target sets and intelligence analysis reports. The three focus areas within MSA include: (1) Integrated Tracking, Analysis and Discovery (ITAD), (2) Multi-Source Information Extraction &amp; Analysis, and (3) Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Enterprise to the Edge (CETE). AFRL/RI intends to utilize the APEX Center capabilities to assist analytical studies, on-site and network distributed simulation exercises, and the processing of real-world, multi-INT data. The availability or use of Government Furnished Property/Government Furnished Equipment (GFP/GFE) will be determined on a contract-by-contract basis, but no GFP/GFE is anticipated at this time. Any GFP/GFE required by the offerors must be clearly identified in the submitted white paper.</p>
<p>Descriptions of Key Focus Areas:</p>
<p>1. ITAD intends to enable the analyst's ability to collect, characterize and locate activities and transactions. This includes identifying and locating actors conducting the activities and transactions, the networks of these actors, the relationships between networks, and the development of patterns of life (spatial and temporal motion statistics). ITAD seeks to develop automated processing and exploitation capabilities for activity based detection, normalcy and wide-area motion statistics. There are two major areas under ITAD: Motion Exploitation (ME) and Activity-Based Intelligence (ABI). ME includes automatic tracking and activity detection. ABI includes patterns of life, motion-augmented link and network discovery, and activity characterization. The specific technology areas of interest under these areas include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Automatic Tracking is developing technology to perform continuous tracking of objects through the use of multi-intelligence feature and contextual data from similar and dissimilar domains. Performance must be optimized across sensor variations, target densities, real time/forensic operations, automatic/operator in the loop control, and operational scenarios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activity Detection is developing automated techniques and tools to discover activity within the motion data (events, sequences, changes) to provide clues to analysts and for automated analysis. This spans individual activities (e.g. check point avoidance) through aggregate Area of Interest (AOI) -wide motion activities (e.g. traffic volume or full retreat).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wide Area Motion Statistics, characterizes and develops patterns of life in researching automated tools to exploit motion data including anomaly detection to characterize normalcy, finds origins and destinations, and relates statistical features to events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Motion-Augmented Link and Network Discovery area develops algorithms to define and exploit multi-source networks representing adversary organizational structure and behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activity Characterization is researching techniques to dynamically update the assessment of insurgent activity with the probable intent, phase of operation, location, timing and participants associated with observed or detected activities and events. This will characterize and assess detected activity by combining kinematic analysis with behavior analysis and social network analysis for enhanced and timely situational awareness (SA).</p>
<p>AFRL/RI is soliciting innovative research white papers of interest to the Activity Based Analysis Branch for the specific technology areas listed above. Advancements are required to optimize performance, algorithm development, researching techniques and develop automatic techniques and tools.</p>
<p>2. Multi-Source Information Extraction &amp; Analysis capabilities allow for the efficient and effective exploitation of information that is contained within large volumes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured textual data. These data sets are very challenging to exploit as they can include material from many different sources, languages, genres and domains of interest and can be so vast that the application of automated analysis and visualization tools is necessary to have a chance at achieving a comprehensive understanding of the content. Employing Multi-Source Information Extraction &amp; Analysis capabilities greatly reduces the time it takes analysts to exploit these ever increasing volumes of textual data to produce reliable decision-making information. Addressing this textual data overload is a foundational component of the Secretary of Defense's "Data to Decisions" science and technology priority. The major areas within Multi-Source Information Extraction &amp; Analysis include: (1) Entity, Event &amp; Relationship (EER) Extraction; (2) Association &amp; Resolution (A&amp;R); and (3) Analysis &amp; Visualization (A&amp;V). EER addresses the extraction of entities, events and relationships from open source text, messages, reports, social media and structured databases such as transactions, communications, social relationships, sightings, and organizational structures. A&amp;R deals with multi-source/document data association and resolution as well as consolidation and association of data across disparate information sources using techniques such as standardization, normalization and probabilistic reasoning techniques. A&amp;V is developing algorithms for analysis and visualization of entities, events and relationships as they change over time. Parallelizable batch and real time graph analytic algorithms and heuristics to derive and maintain graph measures, graph matching and graph bundling to identify semantic and structural equivalences, and graph mining to discover new patterns of interest. The specific technology areas of interest under these areas include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EER Extraction: Data preparation (e.g. document zoning), smart filtering (e.g. document and corpus summarization), extraction of explicit and non-explicit entities, events, relationships and their attributes, within document entity and event co-reference, exploitation of idiosyncratic text types (e.g. micro text), sentiment analysis, domain customization and native foreign language exploitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A&amp;R: Cross source entity and event resolution, data source alignment, hard/soft fusion, and deception detection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A&amp;V: Social network analysis, network analytics, pattern discovery, scalable algorithms, and novelty detection.</p>
<p>AFRL/RI is soliciting innovative research white papers of interest to the Activity Based Analysis Branch for the technology areas listed above, and their effective application to meet operator/analyst needs. Advancements are required to increase the speed, scalability and accuracy of textual analysis; to provide a greater depth of understanding of textual content, effectively map and link multiple concepts and relationships to increase comprehension and coordinate the derived knowledge across multiple intelligence media.</p>
<p>3. The C4ISR Enterprise to the Edge (CETE) program seeks innovative revolutionary solutions for processing closer to the sensors to minimize the latency of exploitation products associated with very high density and high throughput airborne sensors offsetting severe communication constraints by significant onboard computing capabilities. A strategic approach should take advantage of mission context and location specific exploitation, semi-automated and assistive methods to multiply analyst effectiveness and/or autonomous and dynamically steerable decision making algorithms. Fast and efficient summarization, indexing, storage, management, and delivery methods based on high performance computing are critical to this vision. Distributed computing models applicable to concurrent coordinated sensing, summarization of dynamic events, through multiple independently moving sensor platforms is critical to develop the next generation of persistent surveillance across large hostile areas. Evasive presence and opportunistic reach-back communication, and associated onboard processing are among the options. Future platforms will combine multiple independently moving passive and coordinated risk-managed active sensing including: video, hyperspectral, passive-radar, and quasi-passive multistatic synthetic aperture imaging, and must robustly address operations within a denied environment (Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD)) through stand-off surveillance and autonomous operations, taking advantage of dynamic awareness derived from other sources (SIGINT). A combined advantage of sensor-persistence, on-board storage, on-board computing, and intelligent exploitation algorithms will offer a wide range of solutions to effectively meet the mission requirements. Major areas under CETE include Context-Based Exploitation Architecture Designs (CBEAD), Information Management (IM), adaptive methods of latency minimization, Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), Mapping of Key Algorithms on versatile architecture (MoKA) to deliver "code-once and run anywhere" capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CBEAD area will focus on context specific exploitation algorithms including intelligent ways of estimating resource requirements impacting onboard realization of such exploitation algorithms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MoKA area will focus on developing approaches to map algorithms to on board processors of varied computational resources. The objective is to ensure that the algorithms can be effectively implemented on-board a platform within size, weight, and power (SWaP) restrictions. Furthermore, the developed solutions are required to meet the data storage requirements, and utilize computing methods to exploit both long-duration persistent data, and short-duration tactical data, while smartly adapting the computational effort to the required throughput.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IM area is to ensure that the algorithms utilize big data solutions (e.g. Multidimensional Integrated Ontology (MDIO) and Managed Information Object (MIO)) that balance expressiveness with resource limitations. The IM effort will insure that the information produced by CETE can be effectively distributed across multisensory and multimodal assets, intelligently leverage database solutions and quickly disseminate products to a broad user community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CBIR area is focused on developing exploitation algorithms that can detect, track, and identify targets of interest, monitor regions of interest, measure patterns of life, etc. from standoff-sensors. The intent is for the algorithm to be agnostic to the platform and sensor specifics and to produce low-bandwidth products that can be efficiently disseminated in real time to a broad user community. Method designs should push processing closer to the sensor to eliminate communication latency constraints, improve salient content, and enable robust mission solutions.</p>
<p>AFRL/RI is soliciting innovative research white papers of interest to the Activity Based Analysis Branch for the specific technology areas listed above and will span various maturity levels. Advancements are required to increase the speed of image-based analysis, provide a greater depth of understanding of image-based content, effectively map and link multiple concepts and relationships to increase comprehension and coordinate the derived knowledge across multiple intelligence media.</p>
<p>Solutions proposed for the above three areas will undergo testing, evaluation, integration, and verification in the APEX Center. The facility may be used to perform analysis for all efforts proposed under this BAA. The overall mission is to understand, measure, and advance the state of technology in the fusion of information. Offerors should consider any potential advancements that may be required for the APEX Center to support this BAA's 3 focus areas. If specialized modeling and simulation, scenarios for testing, analytical tools, algorithm developments, or new evolving metrics and evaluation standards are required in order for the Government to perform tasks within the APEX Center, include that information within the white paper.</p>

Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: (a) Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; (b) Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and (c) Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p><strong>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.<br />All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.

Title: MARKET SURVEY- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION / Airport Surveillance Radar Model 9 
(ASR-9) Market Survey Announcement 
Name:  Contracting Officer Craig Mayo)
Organization: AAQ-210 
Region: HQ - FAA Headquarters (Washington, DC) 
Phone Number: 202 267-0773 
E-Mail: craig.mayo@faa.gov
Date Posted: TBD
Archiving Date:  TBD
Solicitation/Contract No.:  TBD
Phase: Complex Noncommercial 
Procurement Method: Market Survey 
Classification Code: 58 â€“ Communication, detection, & coherent radiation equipment
NAICS Code: 334 â€“ Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing / 334511 â€“ Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing
Posting (brief abstract):  This Market Survey is issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.  

1.	Background
The FAA currently operates numerous distinct primary radar systems for terminal aircraft surveillance and airport hazardous weather detection in the nationâ€™s terminal airspace. These radar systems, Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) models 8, 9, and 11 are nearing the end of their life cycle and will require Service Life Extension Programs (SLEPs) to continue operational service. Sustainment and upgrade programs can keep these radars operating in the near to mid-term. For the long term, the FAA recognizes that replacement of these radars is the best option. The Next Generation Surveillance and Weather Radar Capability (NSWRC) Program is currently in the investment analysis phase. 

2.	Introduction/Purpose
The purpose of this Market Survey is to determine whether or not adequate industry competition exists, should the Government proceed with this procurement, and to determine the feasibility for participation by small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SEDB) that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The FAA has a requirement for a comprehensive solution(s) to address several issues of immediate concern impacting the operational readiness, sustainability and maintainability of the ASR-9 system including but not limited to the following:

a.	Resolve numerous supportability and maintenance issues that have surfaced over the years since the system was initially fielded in 1987.  
b.	Provide for consolidation of components and functions, 
c.	Consider potential future supportability and maintenance issues.  
d.	Requires the use of COTS and non-proprietary hardware and software unless an exemption or waiver is approved.
e.	Provide an itemized listing of potential COTS items to be included as part of the proposed solution.
f.	Must encompass 128 ASR-9 systems used at the Federal Aviation Administrationâ€™s busiest airports, three (3) mobile systems, and four (4) support systems in the National Airspace System (NAS).  
g.	Project performance period is October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2021.

h.	Should be designed to extend the life of the ASR-9 to at least 2026 by solving current and future supportability issues. 

The FAA is seeking different possible approaches and recommendations that take into consideration that it may not be in the best interest of the Government or the flying public to keep these high maintenance systems in service until 2026.  

Attachment 1 is the Business Declaration form.  Attachment 2 contains a description of the currently identified supportability and maintenance issues referenced above for consideration and inclusion by industry as part of its response to this announcement.  Issues identified are based on the ASR-9 Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) Obsolescence Study dated April 2, 2014 and analysis by subject matter experts.  The study was prepared by the Radar Product Division, FAA Logistics Center, Oklahoma City and is provided as Attachment 3.  It does not take into consideration future supportability and maintenance issues beyond 2020.  Attachments 4 through 9 contain other supporting technical documentation describing the radar and associated components.
3.	Nature of Competition 

1.	The acquisition strategy for the procurement has not been determined at this time.  Unrestricted competition or a set-aside may be chosen.
     
2.	Depending on the responses to the market survey a determination will be made as to whether or not this procurement will be unrestricted or a set-a-side.

Accordingly, this Market Survey must not be construed as either a promise to award a contract or an obligation for the Government to provide compensation for information associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries addressing this Market Survey.   All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the FAA. The FAA reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey.  Responses will not be returned.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of this survey or results of information submitted.  The principle North American Industry Classification System code for this effort is 334511, â€œAir Traffic Control Radar Systems and Equipment Manufacturing.â€

Posting (brief abstract):  This Market Survey is issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.

Background

The FAA currently operates a number distinct secondary radar systems for terminal and en route aircraft surveillance in the nationâ€™s airspace.  These secondary radar systems are the Air Traffic Control Beacon Interrogator Model 5 and 6, and the Mode Select Beacon System (Mode S) Sensor.  The Mode S has passed the end of life cycle and has required Service Life Extension Program (SLEPs) to continue operational service.  Sustainment and upgrade programs can keep these radars operating in the near to mid-term.  For the long term, the FAA recognizes that replacement of these radars is the best option.  Approximately 68 Mode S systems will be decommissioned starting sometime after the beginning of 2020.  A total of 80 remaining systems to include all En Route domain Mode S systems, 45 core airport Terminal domain systems, 3 mobile systems and 8 support systems.  The Next Generation Backup Surveillance Capability (NBSC) Program is currently in the investment analysis phase and is scheduled to begin replacing the remaining secondary radar systems in 2026.

Introduction/Purpose

The purpose of this Market Survey is to determine whether or not adequate industry competition exists, should the Government proceed with this procurement, and to determine the feasibility for participation by small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SEDB) that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBAâ€™s 8(a) Program.

The FAA has a requirement for a comprehensive solution(s) to address several issues of immediate concern impacting the operational readiness, sustainability and maintainability of the Mode S system including but not limited to the following:

a.	Resolve numerous supportability and maintenance issues that have surfaced over the years since the system was initially fielded in 1987.  
b.	Provide for consolidation of components and functions.
c.	Consider potential future supportability and maintenance issues.
d.	Requires the use of COTS and non-proprietary hardware and software unless an exemption or waiver is approved.
e.	Must encompass the remaining 80 Mode S systems used by the FAA in the National Airspace System (NAS).
f.	Should be designed to extend the life of the Mode S to at least 2026 by solving current and future supportability issues.
g.	Project performance period is October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2021.

The FAA is seeking different possible approaches and recommendations that take into consideration NBSC and the fact that it might not be in the best interest of the Government or the flying public to keep these high maintenance systems in service until 2026.

The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice, nor will the Government accept proposals as a result of this Notice. The plans and technical specifications for this requirement will only be available upon solicitation issuance. <br /><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION: USACE anticipates a requirement for a firm fixed-price construction contract to accomplish the following work at Center Hill project. <br /><br />The requirement is for construction of a roller compacted concrete (RCC) reinforcing berm downstream of the existing Center Hill auxiliary dam. The concrete gravity RCC berm will be constructed immediately downstream of the toe of the auxiliary dam. The berm will be approximately 850 feet long, 130 feet high, with a 750-foot wide weir. A grouting and inspection gallery is to be constructed along the interior. The face of the berm is conventional concrete or grout enriched. The footprint and abutments require about 100,000 cubic yards of overburden and rock excavation. The space between the saddle dam and RCC berm will be filled with approximately 160,000 cubic yards of unclassified excavated material from stabilization efforts along the left rim. At the left rim, drilling, blasting, scaling and stabilization of rock is required to reshape each side of an existing rock cut to a stable slope. Rock bolts are to be used where blasting methods are inadequate to stabilize individual large blocks of rock. Total material excavated from the left rim is approximately 250,000 CY. <br /><br />Offerors will have an opportunity to attend a scheduled site visit. The date, time, location and registration requirements will be posted in the solicitation. <br /><br />This description is not intended to be all encompassing and is subject to change. <br /><br />NAICS CODE AND SBA SIZE STANDARD: The NAICS code for this project is 237990 with a size standard of $36,500,000. <br /><br />TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: The solicitation will be advertised unrestricted to obtain full and open competition. <br /><br />SOLICITATION AND CONTRACT TYPE: It is anticipated that from the RFP Solicitation, the Government will use the Best Value, Tradeoff Source Selection process (described in FAR 15.101-1) to award one (1) Firm-Fixed Price Construction Contract. <br /><br />DISCLOSURE OF MAGNITUDE OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT: The disclosure of magnitude range is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. <br /><br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated contract period is 940 calendar days after notice to proceed. <br /><br />SOLICITATION RELEASE DATE: The anticipated release date for this solicitation is around October 1, 2015.

The Boeing Company is the sole designer, developer, manufacturer and integrator of the F/A-18 E/F and EA-18 G aircraft and is the only known source with the knowledge, expertise, facilities and qualified personnel necessary to accomplish this effort within the timeframe required. The FPIF contract type allows the Government to share in any cost under runs achieved by the Contractor. Cost history indicates that the prime contractor and its subcontractors have performed consistently under negotiated costs throughout production history.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1(c)
<ARCHDATE>12012015
<DESC>The following Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) is prepared in accordance with 6.302-1(c) Brand Name and 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br />(a) Authority.<br />(1) Citations: 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1)
<p>1. Identification of Agency:<br />The USDA Forest Service, Washington Office AQM-Operations Branch.</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved:<br />The United States Forest Service International Programs (USFS/IP)requests that Stuewe and Sons, Inc. supply the US Forest Service's project for Sustainable environmental and Economic Development (SEED) with its<br />nursery seedling containers.<br />The Forest Service will grow several hundred thousand native seedlings and establish five native plant nurseries in various regions of Jordan over<br />the next three years. In order to accomplish this task, the production of vigorous seedlings by local nurseries is crucial for future restoration success.<br />The quality of native seedlings depends largely on the container model. Container shape and size can also enhance root growth after out-planting. In Jordan, USFS-sponsored consultants and tree nursery experts have<br />witnessed common and frequent problems with nursery seedling growth. These problems include lack of water resources, spiral or bound roots in the container, and root growth into the soil below the containers. In order<br />to avoid these common problems, the project technical specialists have recommended specific Stuewe and Sons, Inc. (based in Tangent, OR), http://www.stuewe.com/, Deepots (D19L and D27L) and their respective<br />trays (D20T) for SEED participating nurseries.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet Agency's Need Including Estimated the Value:<br />Stuewe and Sons, Inc. Deepots and Treepots are long containers designed for roots to reach deep into the soil and are effective for tree plantings in<br />low-moisture areas. These containers produce scientifically appropriate root-to-shoot ratios for tree survival in dry conditions, like Jordan. Both<br />nursery container models are produced by Stuewe and Sons, Inc. Due to their shape and size, they are highly recommended for Jordan's landscape and native tree species. Stuewe and Sons, Inc. is the sole manufacturer of these containers. The estimated cost is between 23,000.00 and $40,000.00<br /><br />4. Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:<br />41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (e.g., unique supplies or services<br />that are available from only one supplier). This requirement is for supplies specific to a brand-name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand-name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer consequently, it does not provide for full and open competition, regardless of the number of sources solicited.</p>
<p>5. Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires use of the Authority Cited:<br />The Stuewe and Sons, Inc. Treepot and Deepot nursery containers models are a trademark brand. They are designed and developed by Stuewe and Sons in their factories. They are uniquely qualified to supply the desired product for the project. Their containers have unique dimensions with depth and narrow diameters and are not manufactured by other nursery container companies. The pots are longer than their competitors with deeper ridges on the sides to promote downward root growth to the tip of the container length. The trays are also designed specifically to fit these custom-sized containers. For example, the Deepot D19L model has a cell volume of 19.2 cubic inches, a cell diameter of 2.5 inches, and a cell depth of 5 inches, and the D27L model requested has a cell volume of 27 cubic inches, a cell<br />diameter of 2.5 inches, and a cell depth of 7 inches--both are larger than common seedling containers. Since the Forest Service's project in Jordan aims to update Jordan's native nurseries away from unreliable plastic poly bag containers to more effective methods, these unique-sized pots will provide benefits at outplanting and an easier equipment transition for nursery managers from large poly bags. tuewe and Sons, Inc. purchased the rights to the mold for the Deepot containers 20 years ago and have since made updates on the basic high quality plastic tructure. The company also owns the injection molds to make the tailored coordinating trays. Stuewe and Sons, Inc. manufactures these containers and trays at its two factories in the U.S. and China. The two most important Deepots for the SEED's work in Jordan are the D19L and D27L models. These models are only produced by Stuewe and Sons, Inc. at their factory in China. Therefore, these items will be sourced from<br />the Stuewe and Sons, Inc. factory in China.<br />The Deepot containers are also reusable and can be used by nurseries for over seven years, providing a much more effective and efficient alternative to traditional poly bags used in Jordan.</p>
<p>6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice was<br />or Will be Publicized as Required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, Which Exception Under 5.202 Applies:<br />After consultation with silvaculture academics and professional tree seedling growers in the United States, Stuewe and Sons containers were recommended for their unique design features which match the soil conditions on the ground in Jordan. USFS technical staff conducted an exhaustive internet search of competitor nursery container manufacturers. Companies such as: Beaver<br />Plastics, Ltd. (based in Vancouver, Canada), Jiffy Products (based in Norway), Nursery Suppliers, Inc. (based in PA, FL, and CA), and Lacebark, Inc. (based in OK), were considered. However, these suppliers do not<br />produce containers with the specific deep and extremely narrow dimensions required for outplanting success in Jordan. A notice will be publicized accordingly.</p>
<p>7. Determination by the Contracting Officer That the Anticipated Cost to the<br />Government will be Fair and Reasonable:<br />A government estimate has been provided and will be utilized to negotiate<br />a fair and reasonable price to the government.</p>
<p>8. Description of Market Research Conducted:<br />The desired product is selected at the advice and recommendation of consulting technical tree nursery experts, including Dr. Anthony Davis,<br />Director of the Center for Forest Nursery and Seedling Research, at the University of Idaho. The Forest Service's technical staff reviewed the various types of nursery containers available in the market, but Stuewe and Sons, Inc. is the only company that manufactures seedling containers with the recommended dimensions for planting in an arid climate. An exhaustive internet search of competitor nursery container companies<br />revealed that Stuewe and Sons is the only manufacturer which produces containers with the deep and narrow dimensions required for successful outplanting in extremely dry, summer season conditions. Other competitor nursery container suppliers considered were:<br />&#61623; Beaver Plastics, Ltd., http://www.beaverplastics.com/#agriculture<br />&#61623; Jiffy Products, http://www.jiffygroup.com/jiffy<br />&#61623; Nursery Suppliers, Inc., http://www.nurserysupplies.com/<br />&#61623; Lacebark, Inc., http://www.lacebarkinc.com/</p>
<p>9. Any Other Facts Supporting the use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:<br />Given the proven outplanting success of Stuewe and Sons, Inc. container seedlings, the company now sells millions of these specified containers to fruit, nut, and restoration tree growers. These containers are not designed for ornamental plants, but specifically for growing seedlings to survive for restoration in arid climates, with long, hot, and dry summers.</p>
<p>10. A listing of the Sources, if any, That Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:<br />Not applicable.</p>
<p>11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency may Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition Before any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required:<br />This action where, as a commercial practice, is an equipment purchase which is specific to the company where it is procured. For this purchase there are no other companies that can provide the specialized equipment needed to support this mission.</p>
