<DESC>NASA/SSC plans to issue a Best Value Request for Offer (RFO) to Repair and Modernize Fire Alarm System, Various Buildings. The work for this requirement consists of, but is not limited to the following: Provide all labor, equipment, and materials including training to install an integrated addressable fire alarm protection system in Bldgs. B-4110, 4210 and 4995 located at Stennis Space Center.  The buildings identified in this solicitation have existing fire alarm systems that shall be removed.  The individual fire alarm systems in each building shall utilize Monaco transceivers.	    The work requires careful planning, scheduling and coordination in order to minimize impact to site activities.  At no time shall a building be unprotected (monitoring and notification) for fire safety.  All work will be accomplished in occupied and operating facilities.	 Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance, and relevant experience) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the Offerors and the Government. BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts). However, the Government will consider awarding to an Offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.  Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so.       The order of magnitude for this procurement is $500,000 to $1,000,000, and the effort shall be completed within (365) calendar days after receipt of the notice to proceed.	    This procurement is unrestricted. The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 238210 and $12.0 million, respectively. This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.  As a result, all qualified sources may submit a bid, which shall be considered by the agency.	  The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about Feb 21, 2003, with an anticipated bid closing date of on or about Mar 24, 2003. The firm date for receipt of bids or offers will be stated in the RFO.	 An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".	 Specifications and Drawings will only be made available on CDROM. Requests for copies shall be made by email to the Bid Distribution Office:  Anita.DeMarco-1@nasa.gov or you may fax your request to (228) 688-1141.	 The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement [with the exception of the specifications and drawings] will be available over the Internet at NASA/SSC Business Opportunities page:  http://nais.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=64	   Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>Sources Sought.  The Headquarters, Air Force Services Agency, Workers? Compensation Branch, (HQ AFSVA/SVXBW) is seeking to identify companies offering a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) windows-based Workers Compensation Claims Management System (WCCMS).  The AF Workers Compensation Program is self-insured and self-administered in accordance with the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act (LHWCA) regulated by the US Dept of Labor (DOL).  The program provides benefits to approximately 27,000 Non-Appropriated Fund (NAF) employees worldwide.  Since program inception in 1975, nearly 80,000 claims have been processed and current statistics indicate that an average of 1,400 new claims are processed each year.  The AF Services Agency is looking for vendors that can provide a turnkey industry standard WCCMS system that is windows-based, N-tier architecture, and supports a global Internet portal solution to provide base-level access to information and electronic submission of claims data to the program office, improves flexibility and efficiency to streamline the claims management process, and provide flexible user-designed business rules.  The system currently being used is a DOS-based claims management software system, which was tailored to manage, analyze, and monitor workers compensation claims.  Conversion of the existing WCCMS data will be required.  The architecture must be ODBE compliant, interface with Microsoft Windows 2000 Operating System and MS SQL 2000 database environments, and meet Air Force security standards.   All interested parties will submit 1) Product Brochures/Information which provides a detailed description of COTS WCCMS being offered; 2) hardware requirements needed to run system; 3) Company profile, including reference installed sites currently using the proposed system with contact names and phone numbers.  Please submit the information to the following address:  AFNAF Purchasing Office, ATTN:  Maxine Coburn, 9504 IH 35 North Suite 370, San Antonio, TX 78233.  The information received will be considered confidential and will not be disclosed without the express written consent of the supplier.  This notice does not express or implies the intent to purchase any service or to enter into a contractual agreement.  Any information provided will be at no cost to the Government.  This information is required no later than close of business February 14, 2003.  Non appropriated funds are generated by the military community through sales of goods and services and the collection of fees and charges for participation in military community programs.  This purchase does not involve federal tax dollars.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Pathology (LP), Specialized Diagnostics Unit plans to procure immunohistochemical and in situ-hybridization staining reagents and supplies from Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., 3865 North Business Center Drive, Tucson, AZ 85705. The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.5 as an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees. The Laboratory of Pathology (LP) has a need to provide immunohistochemical staining requested by both the diagnostic services and research laboratories within the LP.  These stains have become an essential part of cancer diagnosis and have an equally important role in the diagnosis of many infectious diseases.  Immunohistochemistry is a widespread and accepted technique used in nearly every diagnostic surgical pathology laboratory and research laboratories throughout the world.  The reagents shall be used for diagnostic immunohistochemistry laboratory clinical use as well as for supporting clinical and basic research in the LP.  The automated portable immunostainers shall be used to support the increased clinical and research demands being placed upon the immunohistochemistry laboratory.  The NCI  has purchased several automated immunostaining/in situ-hybridization systems (i.e. Ventana ES, NexES, Benchmark and Discovery systems) from Ventana Medical Systems under  previous contracts.  Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. is the only source known to NCI that can provide the reagents and supplies that are required to operate the Ventana automated immunostainers/in situ-hybridization Ventana ES, NexES, Benchmark and Discovery systems.  The reagents are proprietary to Ventana Medical. The Government will be the direct beneficiary of a contract for reagents and supplies because it will maintain and improve the quality of patient care and further cancer research.  Without the reagents, the existing automated systems cannot be used.  Changing variables at this time would interrupt correct interpretation of experiments in progress.  Period of Performance: Upon award of purchase order through twelve (12) months, with three (3) twelve (12) month option renewals if exercised;  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (November 1999) and FAR Clause 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (March 2000) applies to this order.  The requirement will be a fixed price order.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above supplies, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EST (local Washington D.C. time) on February 14, 2003.   If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is planning to study up to 180 pediatric off-patent drugs under the Best Pharmaceutical for Children Act (BPCA) law in the nest five years.  Each drug study will have different PODS centers comprised of several clinical sites, depending upon the requirements of each drug stduy.  NICHD is planning to award a contract for a Coordinating Center for the Pediatric Off-Patent Drugs Study (PODS) centers.  The purpose of this RFP is to solicit proposals for the award of a single BPCA-CC that will provide logistical and statistical support for the PODS Centers.  The BPCA-CC Contractor will provide logistical, administrative, pharmaceutical and technical support to maintain, coordinate, and administer multi-site networks of clinical centers.  The BPCA-CC will also prepare and submit to the FDA all data from the studies conducted by the PODS Centers and the necessary documentation in the form of a Final Study Report to support labeling of the drugs studied.  Subject data collection will take place at the PODS Centers and, if necessary, at their subcontracted clinical sites.  It is anticipated that the PODS Centers, established by competitively awarded contracts for the study of off-patent durgs, will change from drug study to drug study, while the BPCA-CC will remain unchanged for the duration of the BPCA-CC contract.  The BPCA-CC will oversee the activities of a number of clinical drug trials in various stages of completion, i.e., initiation, implementation, completion and reporting.  A major responsibility of the BPCA-CC will be to integrate the drug trials across dissimilar clinical sites, insure integrity of the data and compliance with FDA and NIH policies on the conduct of clinical trials.  The activities conducted by the BPCA-CC will support both data collection and evaluation prior to submission of final reports to the FDA and the NICHD.  This effort is essential to assuring that the data appearing in the final study report are of high quality and relevant for consideration of drug label modification for pediatric indications.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541990.  The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available on or about February 10, 2003 at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  All responses must be submitted on or before May 12, 2003 to: Mrs. Mya Hlaing, Contracting Officer, NICHD, CMB, 6100 Building, Suite 7A07, 6100 EXECUTIVE Blvd., MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6100 Executive Blvd., Suite 7A07, Rockville, Maryland 20852).  Fully electronic copies will not be accepted.  The reference number to be used for this announcement is: RFP NICHD-2003-02.  All coorespondence must cite the referenced number as provided.

<DESC>This NASA Research Announcement (NRA) provides an opportunity for members of the scientific community to propose interdisciplinary research in response to seven questions taken from the NASA Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) Research Strategy.  These questions are below. 	  How are global ecosystems changing? 	 What trends in atmospheric constituents and solar radiation are driving global climate?        How is global sea level affected by climate change? 	How are variations in local weather, precipitation and water resources related to global climate variation?    What are the consequences of climate and sea level changes and increased human activities on coastal regions?  How well can long-term climate trends be assessed or predicted? 	 How well can cycling of carbon through the Earth system be modeled, and how reliable are predictions of future atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane by these models? Investigations selected under this NRA will constitute the next phase of the ESE Earth Observing System Interdisciplinary Science Program (EOS/IDS).  EOS/IDS investigations should integrate research from more than one of the Earth science disciplines traditionally supported by ESE.  NASA encourages investigations using data and models from multiple satellites and sensors.  Results of selected research should provide inputs to or promote the development of models that advance our understanding of important aspects of the Earth system.	     Participation in this NRA is open to all categories of institutions, including educational, industrial, non-profit organizations, NASA centers and other US agencies.  Participation by non-U.S. institutions must meet specific guidelines contained in the NRA and include a no-exchange-of-funds provision.  The complete NRA will be available electronically on the release date, via the Internet at the Research Opportunities Web Page at http://research.hq.nasa.gov under "Office of Earth Science (Code Y)".  A paper copy will be available to those who do not have access to Internet by calling (202) 358-3552 and leaving a voice mail message. This announcement will be open from February 14, 2003 through May 1, 2003, and proposals may be submitted at any time throughout this period. Notice of Intent is due March 14, 2003.

Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USPS activities.

In order to be considered for the pre-qualification process, all interested parties must submit information that addresses the items listed in the Request for Information section of the attached document.  Potential suppliers must submit a separate statement for each segment of the CSM system for which they wish to pre-qualify:  Business, Residential, and/or Conceptualization and Analysis.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  A portable instrument system capable of rapidly and non-intrusively identifying high value, strategic, or nuclear dual-use materials. The Dual Use Analyzer employs eddy current technologies to make multi-frequency on-contact electrical conductivity measurements. The instrument enables a user/operator to interrogate and identify a strategic material in the field in less than 5 seconds.   As a screening tool, this technology augments the expensive and time-consuming process entailing on-site sample collection and off-site laboratory sample analysis.  The instrument provides a simple text/graphics display for immediate results and the storage facility for maintaining an inspection log, archiving the material electronic signatures, and accessing tariffs and regulations. Several different versions of the packaging, hardware design, probe and embedded software have been developed over the past few years and are available for license.

            Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<SOLNBR>TIRSE-03-R-00001
<RESPDATE>042103
<ARCHDATE>05062003
<CONTACT>Linda Bender, Contract Specialist, Phone 404-338-9210, Fax 404-338-9233, Email linda.bender@irs.gov
<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Atlanta, Georgia, has a requirement for Sign Language Interpretation to reasonably accommodate its deaf/hard of hearing employees working in various offices located in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area.  Sign Language interpretation is an ongoing requirement, with fluctuating needs arising throughout the year.  The IRS Atlanta (Chamblee) Territory presently has approximately 156 deaf/hard of hearing employees working in the Atlanta area offices during its peak season (October through May annually); and approximately 100 during non-peak.  The majority of deaf/hard of hearing employees work at the Atlanta Campus, located in Chamblee, Georgia.  The Atlanta Campus operates on a 24-hour day, 7 days per week work schedule, including Federal Holidays.

Sign Language interpretation is needed to accommodate deaf/hard of hearing employees in a variety of work-related settings.  Settings include, but are not limited to,  office and job-related issues  (e.g. work group meetings; employee orientations; training; conferences and seminars; employee/manager meetings, to include those regarding performance and/or disciplinary actions; and  other employment situations), medical or mental health issues (e.g. meetings with IRS Health Facility nurse or  Employee Assistance Program contractor), or assignments that may involve legal issues (e.g. participation in work-related legal procedures as a defendant, witness, suspect, etc.).

Interpretation services are primarily required for interpreting spoken English to American Sign Language and American Sign Language to Spoken English.  Any of the recognized sign languages (Pidgeon Signed, Exact Signed, Tactical, Oral, etc) may be required. 

The contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supplies, and supervision necessary to successfully perform sign language interpretation services for IRS.

Only skilled Sign Language interpreters meeting the minimum qualification standards set forth in the solicitation shall provide interpretation services.  The contractor shall provide interpreters to perform services on-site at the IRS designated location.  Note: Alternate methods of interpretation service (e.g. video conferencing) may be proposed by prospective offerors. Such alternate methods are subject to review, evaluation and final acceptance by the Contracting Officer prior to contract award.
  
Offerors should note that IRS is proposing to hire and provide its own staff interpreter(s) to perform interpretation services.  Should IRS implement its plan for staff interpreters, the requirement for services under this contract is anticipated to decrease significantly.

Contract performance will be ordered based upon the actual needs of IRS to accommodate its employees, anytime 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, including Federal observed holidays. 

The contract term includes a base period and annual option renewal periods totaling 60 months.   All option periods will be exercised at the discretion of the Government.

Services will be ordered on an as-needed basis by issuance of individual task orders to the Contractor with as little as 24 hours notice.  Interpreting requirements may result in as many as 10 interpreters providing services on any given day.

The solicitation for sign language interpreting services is based on awarding a requirements type contract using fixed labor-hour rates.    

The solicitation includes two types of service requirements, On-Call, and OJI:

On-Call Services are interpretation services typically consisting of limited periods-of-performance.  On-Call services are used to accommodate deaf/hard of hearing employees for specifically identified tasks (e.g., attending a work group meeting or attend a training session on a specific date and time.)  
OJI services are interpretation services provided on a full-time basis (i.e. 8 to 10 hours daily) for designated deaf/hard of hearing employee(s) requiring on the job instruction, normally at the executive program level.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This requirement is to provide the Department of Commerce (DOC) and other Government Agencies with a select range of Engineering (AE) services, primarily focusing on commissioning for new facilities, and recommissioning of existing facilities.  This announcement replaces the previous notice made under solicitation number NAAJ8700300040JDD.  Firms responding to the previous announcement may supplement their submission, but need not resubmit 254/255's under this new notice.  The contract will consist of a 12-month base period from the date of contract award and four, 12-month option periods. Services will be implemented through individual task orders, with a total contract amount not to exceed $9.5 million over the five-year contract life. The AE shall provide the personnel, equipment, and materials needed to support the Government in its responsibilities of providing the commissioning efforts of projects or programs for its worldwide facilities.  It is anticipated that the primary emphasis of the effort accomplished under this contract for commissioning shall fall in the technical discipline areas of mechanical engineering (including but not limited to HVAC, plumbing, fire protection, DDC), electrical engineering (including but not limited to UPS, emergency generator, lightning protection, fire alarm systems), and specialty items (including but not limited to voice/data, telecommunications, security, CCTV). Other technical disciplines (examples:  environmental, geologist, value engineer, etc.) could be required to a lesser degree.  The AE  (herein referred to as the Commissioning Agent or CA) shall provide professional engineering, and consultation services (i.e., commissioning/ recommissioning) related to resolving problems in the implementation and construction of Government facility projects and programs for current and other fiscal years. The CA shall be certified as a commissioning agent by the Associated Air Balance Council (AABC), the National Environmental Balancing Bureau (NEBB), or equivalent. The commissioning and recommissioning work may include such items as review of other AE design and construction documents, review of other AE value engineering proposals, review of other AE cost estimates, verification of construction contractor's efforts during construction, review and investigation of construction contractor's cost proposals for proposed changes, engineering and architectural design and review, and some engineering during construction.  The AE will also provide services for building maintenance planning services, system component training, construction warranty inspections, and follow-up inspections of facilities after construction is complete. The following items are indicative of the types of work to be accomplished and are not intended to be inclusive but only representative. Facility Commissioning and Recommissioning:  Commissioning is the systematic process of ensuring that all building systems are designed and will perform interactively according to the Client's project requirements and operational needs. Recommissioning is the process by which the original Client's project requirements, existing facility systems, present operating requirements, present load conditions, and available solutions are evaluated according to current operations and reconciled for the most efficient and effective operation. Facility Commissioning Design Phase:  The Commissioning Agent (CA) will serve a vital role in assisting with the flow of information between the Client, the Project Manager and the design team.  With this process, the Client can be sure that specific objectives and expectations have been conveyed to and understood by the design team.  The CA will also play a vital role in providing recommendations and assistance to the design team in reviewing and commenting on the Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) design components, and Value Engineering proposals.  Throughout the design, the CA will work with the design team to ensure that each system component is selected to meet the design requirements, and incorporated into the overall design documents.  The CA will also work with the designer to ensure that the construction specifications include the appropriate commissioning responsibilities required of the construction contractor and all appropriate functional testing procedures required of each system to be installed.  Construction Phase:  During construction, the CA will work to ensure that each component is installed correctly, and operates to meet the performance requirements of the design.  The CA will review and provide applicable comment during the review of shop drawing submittals, review of Client/contractor/AE proposed change orders, review of Request For Information (RFI) from the contractor, Non-Compliances issued to the contractor, observation of the equipment installation, and assisting with start-up of major systems and components.  The CA will be responsible for preparing and presenting a "Draft" Commissioning Plan to the COTR. The plan shall take full cognizance of all design intent and specific requirements as outlined in the Contract Documents.   The "Draft Commissioning Plan" shall include: 1) Establishment of a "Commissioning Team" during construction.  The Team shall include the Client, the project designers, the construction contractor, (and key subcontractors, i.e., General, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, Sheet-metal, and Controls contractors). The CA will chair over this team of individuals. 2) A summary of each system element to be commissioned, each commissioning procedure to be executed, all documentation required for the final commissioning report and responsibilities for delivering each element of the commissioning plan. 3) The draft-commissioning plan shall include specific procedures required of the contractor (and as outlined in the specifications) for each system to be commissioned.  The procedures will include: a) Purpose of the procedure, b) Acceptance criteria, c) Method of testing d) Instrumentation required, e) Report requirements. 4) Commissioning Schedules and priorities. 5) Documentation requirements and format (checklists for recording inspections, startup, functional performance tests, unit capacities, installation and operations instructions, etc.). 6) Format and program for training Client's Operating and Maintenance personnel. The contract type will be an indefinite delivery order contract to support federal facilities nationwide. All work must be accomplished by or under the direct supervision of licensed professional Architects and/or Engineers. Many designs will be required to be in metric dimensions.  A strong emphasis on "green" design and construction under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program and principles will be included in all projects. It is a requirement that the proposing firm and consultants have, as a minimum, electronic mail service for the purpose of accomplishing contract progress reviews, coordination, transmission of electronic files, and day-to-day communications. Selection criteria in descending order of importance are as follows: (1) Past performance on contracts for commissioning with government agencies and private industry in terms of quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. For the last ten completed projects identify the type of construction contract, give number and value of construction change orders; give the project schedules (design and construction) with scheduled completion versus actual completion; and provide letters of recommendation and federal agency performance evaluations. Identify both a project client and an end-user point of contact with current phone numbers and email addresses for each project. Referenced projects should not be more than five years old. (SF 254, paragraphs 10 and 11, and SF 255, paragraphs 8, 9, and 10, plus supplemental information.) (2) Professional qualifications and experience necessary for satisfactory performance of required services in reviewing designs for laboratory and research facilities, multipurpose office facilities, restoration and renovation of existing facilities, and facilities in coastal and arctic environments; preparing studies and analyses; performing cost estimating and value engineering and performing engineering during construction.

<DESC>Alien Address Management
Request for Information

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION?Alien Address Management System (AAM).  
This notice identifies the Department of Justice (DOJ), Immigration and Naturalization Service?s (INS) intent to acquire an integrated, Automated Information System (AIS) that will be known as the ?Alien Address Management? (AAM) System.  The INS is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit information from commercial entities capable of providing the services and products described herein.  The system will have to comply with architectural, technical, security, business processes and legislative requirements.  This RFI is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), but, rather, is an exploratory request to identify capabilities, obtain expressions of interest, determine the availability of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products, market information and contractor capabilities for Government planning purposes.  The AAM team is seeking to identify and resolve concerns regarding the feasibility of the requirements, integration of the various technologies, and other industry concerns or questions related to this acquisition.  
BACKGROUND

	INS is required to maintain current address information for all aliens residing in the 	United States for longer than 30 days.  Aliens who change their address are currently 	required to notify INS via a standard form within 10 days of the change.  INS currently 	maintains 19 automated systems that contain alien and alien-related addresses.  At present, these systems are not integrated to allow for a synchronized inventory of alien information.  These systems do not interface with each other allowing the possibility that each system could indicate a different address for a single alien.  In addition, failure by INS to note a properly submitted AAM in all relevant systems could result in negative legal consequences for the INS. Currently INS receives and processes between 6 and 9 million application each year.  INS admits between 1.4 and 1.7 million people each year. Any address information received on initial contact would be entered into this system.  In 	addition, each time an alien in the United States changes his or her address, this information would be recorded in the proposed system. INS currently has 22 million active files in its system.  For the six months from August 2002 to January 2003, the INS has received over 850,000 change of address forms.  The objective of the AAM system is to improve the process of collecting, updating, and maintaining address information related to aliens and associated entities.  The goal is to ensure compliance with Federal regulations regarding AAM notification while providing a means to facilitate locating and contacting aliens.  
SOLUTION REQUIREMENTS
The AAM solution must provide one source of alien address information containing information source and history, thereby requiring only one change notification from an alien to update address information Service-wide.  There must be data-integrity and quality-assurance safeguards to ensure that accurate and uniform data is maintained and to provide reverse look-up functionality.  All data collection input methods must provide the alien with a clear understanding of what information is required to comply with INS guidelines in order to receive benefits or services.  User-generated reports must include historical and statistical outputs in addition to ad-hoc reports that do not require programming intervention.  The solution should automatically generate correspondence to aliens notifying them of receipt of the notification by INS.  Data-verification reports should provide validation of INS data by comparing it to commercial-address databases with the understanding that no commercially obtained address would populate an INS database automatically or overwrite alien-provided input.  INS AAM system users must be able to ?mark? an address as invalid with a reason until information can ve the capability to send and receive address information electronically to and from INS legacy systems as well as designated Government agencies within INS rules and Memoranda of Understanding.  All information sent and received by INS must comply with the Privacy Act, other legal mandates, and INS address regulations, as well as the INS Third Party Rule.  Access to sensitive address information must be protected based upon user access roles and depending on alien status.  The solution must be scaleable to meet evolving INS technology needs.  Principal alien information should link to dependent address information.  Information should also link between all individuals indicated as living at the same address.  AAM must be able to maintain no fewer than three address categories for each alien record and have the capability to link a minimum of seven related address records (attorney, sponsor, etc.) to each alien record.  The solution must be able to maintain all standard domestic and international address fields.  In addition to address information, AAM must have the capability to maintain no fewer than 10 personal attribute information fields, including identification numbers (Social Security Number, Admission Number, etc.) as well as biographical information (Date of Birth, Country of Birth, etc.).  The system must have a method to annotate a level of trust for each address record depending on address source and reliability.  Address information input methods must include telephone, mail, in person, Internet, and E-mail and may be integrated with biometric-scan and smart-card capability.  The system must be able to maintain an audit trail and include the following attributes regarding the physical entry of address information:  date of receipt, date of entry into system, effective dates of information, source of information, and individual who entered the information.  A chart reflecting systems and databases currently in use at INS is provided as attachment 1.

PROCUREMENT STRATEGY 
Procurement and implementation may be sought at a later date through the issuance of a statement of work and RFP.  It is anticipated that any such future solicitation could result in an award to multiple offerors.  
SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION
Respondents are asked to provide information that outlines specific capabilities of products and services that may satisfy the broad Governmental requirements as noted herein.  The Government is also interested in relevant experience and contractor qualifications to perform the work envisioned.  This RFI is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue an RFP or ultimately to award a contract.  Responses provided by industry will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this RFI.  Any costs incurred as a result of responding to this RFI shall be borne by the respondent and cannot be charged to the Government for reimbursement.  The information in this RFI represents an overview of the anticipated project, is subject to change, and is in no way binding on the Government.  The Government will not provide any direct feedback to industry in general.  The Government may utilize any information submitted by interested parties to assist in the development of the statement of work for the contemplated RFP.  Offerors are advised not to submit any proprietary information that they would not want to be used for this purpose.  A potential offeror may have an idea that does not fit into the existing framework of the current business process, but it may inform the Government of a new and more effective way of doing business.  Potential offerors are encouraged to suggest any and all ideas they have that can add value to the process.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT

Transportation Security Administration

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is announcing the Port Security Grants Program based on the seaport security provisions contained in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 107-117, H.R. Conf. Rpt 107-350) and the FY2002 Supplemental Appropriation (Public Law 107-206). TSA is coordinating with the Maritime Administration (MARAD) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) in this effort.

Total anticipated funding available for Port Security Grants is $104,093,293. This amount does not include funding for Port Incident Training and Exercises, which will be addressed separate from this program and is not covered by this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  All awards under this program are subject to availability of funds. 


Program Description: 
TSA is planning to award competitive grants to critical national seaports/terminals to support efforts for Port Security in the areas of 1) Security Assessments and Mitigation Strategies; 2) Enhanced Facility and Operational Security (including Proof-of-Concept). Grants shall be awarded based on the criteria established for each category. 

Grant applications will be accepted for two categories:

1. Security Assessments and Mitigation Strategies (Category I) ? Award based on proposed security assessments that ascertain vulnerabilities of physical or operational security of a port, multiple terminals, terminal, or vessel (commuter or ferry service) and identify mitigation strategies. 

2. Enhanced Facility and Operational Security (Category II) ? Including but not limited to facility/terminal/vessel (commuter or ferry service) access control, physical security, cargo security and passenger security. Consideration will also be given to proof-of-concept projects which can demonstrate how security would be improved/enhanced by their implementation.


Eligibility Requirements: Critical National Seaports/Terminals. To be considered a critical national seaport/terminal, one or more of the following attributes must be met:
&#61623; One of the 14 designated ?strategic ports?, as designated by a Maritime Administration port planning order.
&#61623; Controlled Port ? Ports which have access controls for vessels from certain countries due to national security issues. Controlled ports are: New London/Groton, CT; Portsmouth, NH (including Kittery, Maine and Dover, New Hampshire on the Piscataqua River); Hampton Roads, VA (including Norfolk, Newport News, Jamestown, Yorktown, and Portsmouth, VA); Charleston, SC; Kings Bay, GA; Port Canaveral, FL; Panama City, FL; Pensacola, FL; Port St. Joe, FL; Port Hueneme, CA; San Diego, CA; and Honolulu, HI.
&#61623; A nationally important economic port or terminal responsible for a large volume of cargo movement or movement of products that are vital to U.S. economic interests as required for national security.
&#61623; Ports, terminals, commuter vessels or ferry service vessels responsible for movement of a high number of passengers.
&#61623; Ports or terminals responsible for the movement of hazardous cargo.

Eligible Parties
&#61623; Public and private ports, terminals or vessels (commuter or ferry service) and state/local government entities
&#61623; Private entities will be considered when security interests related to the location and/or operation affects the greater public interest
&#61623; Consultants may prepare applications for an otherwise eligible party; however, only the eligible party can actually submit the application and be considered for grant award
&#61623; Consortiums composed of local stakeholder groups (i.e. river groups, ports and terminal associations)
&#61623; All grant applications and supporting documentation must be submitted electronically via the Website at https://www.portsecuritygrants.dottsa.net/  Applications and supporting documentation submitted via any other avenue, including but not limited to hardcopy, electronic/e-mail, and facsimile, will not be accepted

Prerequisites
&#61623; For Category II 
&#61623; Applicants must have completed a security assessment and tie the security enhancements to their assessment in order to submit a grant application in this category. Security assessments must be available for review upon the request of the evaluators.  


To establish the criticality under Eligibility Requirements, applicants must provide data/statistics that relate to their specific port project (for port applications), terminal project (for terminal applications), waterways, or commuter vessel or ferry service vessel projects. Terminals and vessels cannot rely on aggregated port statistics to meet eligibility criteria. Evaluators intend to use available applicable government and industry data to assess the reasonableness of cargo type and volume (tonnage and value), hazardous materials data or number of passengers contained in the grant application.

Ineligible Projects/Proposals
The following projects are considered ineligible for award consideration:
&#61623; Projects already receiving funding on a national level, such as transportation worker credentialing, vessel traffic system (VTS), automatic identification system (AIS) and the development of risk/vulnerability assessment models 
&#61623; Projects/items involving funding requirements for personnel, maintenance, and operating expenses
&#61623; Projects involving bridge infrastructure, roads, and nuclear power plants;
&#61623; Projects that do not involve a compelling security benefit (primarily economic or safety vs security)

Selection Preference Considerations
In general, preference will be given to: 
&#61623; Projects that impact a port system vice a single terminal or facility;
&#61623; New installation vs replacing or enhancing existing infrastructure (fences, etc);
&#61623; Projects that enhance intermodal transportation security within the footprint of the port, including pipelines within the terminal
&#61623; Projects that include cost-sharing 
&#61623; Eligible applicants that have made prior security enhancements/investments (eligible applicants must document cost and enhancements completed)
&#61623; Projects that address access, command, control, coordination, and communication, physical security such as lighting, fencing, cameras etc. in Category II, Enhanced Facility and Operational Security
&#61623; Applications that are fully developed, address all application questions and contain a detailed statement of work/supporting documentation

Required Content of Applications

<ARCHDATE>04222003
<CONTACT>Laura Paskman Syms, 732-532-3548
<DESC>NA The Space & Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&TCD) is interested in receiving white papers describing novel concepts, design capabilities and solutions for small UHF antennas operating in the 225-500 MHz frequency band.  The required UHF antennas w ill support radios embedded in Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS), which in turn will provide communication links to and from other sensors and intelligent munitions.   The sensors and munitions are small and light enough to be hand emplaced in selected situa tions but objectively they will be deployed by projectile delivery systems permitting rapid delivery over relatively large areas.  It is envisioned that some of the sensors and munitions will be deployed typically hundreds of meters apart over diverse terr ain features with low proximity to the ground (approx. 0.2m).   Other sensors will be elevated above ground (approx. 1.0m) to facilitate image capture and longer range communications.  The required antennas should provide omni-directional coverage and obje ctively be able to support the various deliverable means described above.  Sources who believe they have the required antennas or can meet the above requirements through modification of existing antennas or new designs are encouraged to provide specifications, item descriptions and other pertinent material to enable S&TCD to deve lop the required capabilities.  Information relative to schedule, design, development, delivery and price would also be helpful.  All propriety information should be marked as such. This RFI/ SS Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the US Army CECOM.  The purpose of this RFI/SS is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of providing the required UHF antennas.   US Army CECOM does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for use of the provided information.  Acknowledgement of rec eipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of S&CTDs evaluation of the information received. SUBMISSION:  Responses to this RFI should be submitted no later than 4:00 pm EST on 21 February 2003.  All responses shall be sent only via email to the following email addresses: yoram.levy@mail1.monmouth.army.mil steven.goodall@mail1.monmouth.army.mil WHITE PAPER REQUIREMENTS: The white paper should be a maximum of three pages in length, single sided, single line spaced and utilizing Times New Roman font with a 12-dot pitch  CECOM POC: Mr. Yoram Levy (732) 427-4664

<DESC>NA The Aviation Mission Area addresses a need for external power for aviation assets, which provides the capability to perform scheduled and unscheduled maintenance on all aircraft systems and subsystems.  The NAPS will be employed worldwide to provide electr ical direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) power, pneumatic, hydraulic power, and aircraft systems cooling support of scheduled and unscheduled maintenance for current and future rotray wing aircraft.  The development and fielding of advanced ai rcraft, (such as AH-64D, CH/MH-47D/ICH, RAH-66, UH/MH-60, and the OH-58D) has exceeded the capabilities of the current Aviation Ground Power Unit (AGPU).  The proposed NAPS will serve Aviation Unit Maintenance (AVUM) and Aviation Intermediate Maintenance ( AVIM) operations during wartime and peacetime.  The NAPS will be capable of being loaded in CH-47 helicopters or sling loaded to the operational area and used for maintenance.  It will be used on the flight line, in the field, as well as in the vicinity of  the hangar to perform its mission on aircraft.  The NAPS will be used wherever there are aviation assets on the battlefield or in garrison.  The NAPS shall be a modular system configured for the purpose of supporting all Army rotary wing aircraft.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command through the Office of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) announce the release of the Fiscal Year 2003 Breast Cancer Research Program (BCRP) Concept Award Program Announcement.  The intent of the Concept Award is to fund the exploration of an initial concept or theory that could give rise to a testable hypothesis; thus, no preliminary data are required.  These awards are to encourage the exploration of untested, high-risk questio ns in breast cancer and are not intended to support the next step in an already established research project. The Concept Award should provide investigators that have potentially insightful ideas from disciplines and fields outside breast cancer with an en tre to the breast cancer research field.  In addition, research proposals submitted by consumers are encouraged. Approximately $17M is available to support Concept Awards.  Through this Program Announcement, the CDMRP is soliciting electronic submissions for short Concept Award proposals.  Concept Awards can be requested for $75,000 for direct costs over a 1-year performance period, plus indirect costs as appropriate. Detailed description of this award mechanism, evaluation criteria and submission requirem ents can be downloaded from the CDMRP web site  (http://cdmrp.army.mil). All proposals will be received electronically. The receipt deadline is March 10, 2003. For more information about the BCRP, BCRP awardees, previous BCRP Program Announcement, and othe r CDMRP-sponsored programs and events, please visit the CDMRP web site: http://cdmrp.army.mil. For additional program information, please send email to: cdmrp.pa@det.amedd.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>A -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON  AN UPPER STAGE ENGINE TECHNOLOGY EFFORT
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  The Government does not intend to award a contract or any other type of agreement on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this synopsis.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation for bid.  The intent of this RFI is to obtain market research.  Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis.
The Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) program continues to be a vital Department of Defense / National Aeronautics and Space Administration (DoD/NASA) and industry effort.  IHPRPT was established to strengthen the technology base of the DoD and commercial rocket propulsion systems through the development of advanced, innovative rocket propulsion technology.
The Air Force and NASA are considering a new upper stage engine technology effort.  It will be managed jointly with an Air Force program manager and NASA deputy program manager.  The objective of this effort is to pursue the IHPRPT upper stage engine goals through improved computational design tools.  This will be achieved in a three part approach consisting of tool improvement/development, implementation, and validation.
The first part will be to improve/develop computational design tools as they relate to LOX/LH2 expander cycle upper stage engines.  The government anticipates these tools to correspond to the conceptual, preliminary, and critical design levels.  The conceptual design tools will include engine and component (turbopump and thrust chamber) tools.  The preliminary and critical design tools will include only turbopump and thrust chamber tools.  The government intends for these computational tools to be available to U.S. Government Agencies and their contractors.
The second part will be to implement engine and component designs using the updated tools.  As each set of tools is completed, the appropriate design work will be initiated (i.e. when the conceptual design tools are ready conceptual design will begin, etc?).  Thrust level will not be specified.  At the completion of this part there will be an upper stage engine conceptual design and turbopump and thrust chamber critical designs.  In order to focus on expanding the component technology, the cycle requirements defined in the conceptual engine design will not be strictly enforced during the component designs.  Risk reduction activities relating to the component development may be identified as options.
The third and final part will be to fabricate and test key components.  The government will choose which components will be tested.  These tests will primarily be used to validate the tools and secondarily to satisfy IHPRPT goals.  Testing will be provided by the government.
An RFI Supplemental Package containing a DRAFT schedule, DRAFT funding profile, and IHPRPT goals and baselines is available.  Only U.S. contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Federal Center, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (800-352-3572) that have a legitimate business purpose or who are teamed with one of the registered contractors will have access.  If you are registered with the DLSC, you must submit a copy of the approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the supplemental package.  To receive a copy of the RFI Supplemental Package contact 1Lt Daniel Wright (661-275-5583).
Please respond to the following questions as they relate to this plan.
1) 	Is the approach of integrated tool improvement and implementation sound?
2) 	Are there any additional tasks the government should consider?
3) 	If only one component is targeted for design and test which component should that be?
4) 	How much of the work can realistically be performed with the DRAFT funding profile shown in the RFI Supplemental Package?
5) 	If you disregarded the DRAFT funding profile, what would your Rough Order Magnitude fully burdened cost for this effort be?
6) 	Has adequate time been scheduled for each task?  If not, what is a more realistic schedule?
7) 	What is your current computational design tool capability?
8) 	What is your current upper stage LOX/LH2 expander cycle engine capability?
9) 	What contract type do you think is most appropriate and why?

THREE copies of each response must be submitted to 1Lt Daniel Wright, AFRL/PRSE, 4 Draco Drive, Edwards AFB, CA  93524.  Electronic responses are acceptable (email address daniel.wright@edwards.af.mil).  Any company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked.  Responses shall be limited to TWO pages per question and are due not later than 30 days from the publication of this notice.  Companies may contact 1Lt Wright for clarification.  The information provided through the responses will be used to aid in requirements definition for future acquisitions.

<SUBJECT>A -- Surface Coatings that Maintain Atomic Coherence
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the Department of Commerce to acquire research support for a study on "Optically Excited Chip Scale Atomic Clocks (CSACs) with Integrated Nanoresonators" from the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado. A. Background: The Time and Frequency Division of NIST currently has a substantial multidisciplinary research program focused on developing ultra-small atomic clocks. Smaller atomic clocks could play an important role in future commercial applications in communication and navigation systems. The goal is to reduce the size of a fully operating atomic frequency reference to below 1 cubic centimeter, while maintaining a high degree of stability. At the heart of most atomic clocks is a vapor cell, a sealed container confining an atomic vapor in a controlled environment. A major part of the research being carried out involves fabricating miniature atomic vapor cells. Miniaturization degrades the stability of an atomic clock at a fundamental level due to more frequent collisions of the atoms with the cell walls. This degradation can be mitigated with the use of a wall coating which reduces the effect of the wall collisions on the atomic coherence and enables the atoms to undergo considerably more wall bounces than would be possible with a regular glass surface. The resulting improvement in performance is one critical step in achieving the clock stability goals set by NIST. Wall coatings with low adsorption energies have been shown to be effective in extending the coherent lifetime of hyperfine-polarized atoms in the cell. In particular wax materials such as paraffin and polyethylene have allowed the atomic coherence to persist for up to 1000 bounces of the atoms on the container walls. However, with higher quality, more uniform coatings, it is likely that even longer coherent lifetimes can be obtained. In addition, it is important to find a way of applying the coatings to small-scale structures and to integrate the coating application into our cell-fabrication process. B. SCOPE:  The proposed study will (1) define surfaces likely to be useful in atomic clock applications, with particular emphasis on Self-Assembled Monolayers (SAMS) and liquid crystal related materials,  (2) prepare high-quality surfaces, applied to the interior walls of spherical glass bulbs provided by NIST and (3) develop a process to apply high-quality coatings to glass and silicon substrates perforated with small (sub-mm) holes. C. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The period of performance consists of a one-year basic contract and a one-year option period.  D. SOLE SOURCE:  NIST has determined that only the University of Colorado's Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal Materials Research Center (FLC MCR) located in Boulder, Colorado can perform this research.  There are four main reasons that only the FLC MCR is the only responsible source for this effort.  Item 1) is the primary justification, and 2-4) outline the reasons that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), of the Department of Defense decided to fund the surface science part of the NIST project as a subcontract to CU. 1) The funding for this effort is a result of a joint proposal submitted by NIST and the University of Colorado to DARPA.  It was awarded through a competitive process. Funding for the first year of this project (FY02) was transferred from NIST to the University of Colorado by a NIST purchase order.  The second and third years of funding (FY03 and FY04) will be transferred through this new contract with the University of Colorado.  Since DARPA selected this project for funding, it is not possible to consider anyone other than Associate Professor Maclennan at the University of Colorado.   Dr. Maclennan and his colleagues in the Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal Materials Research Center (FLC MRC) at the University of Colorado in Boulder are internationally recognized experts in this field, and it is this expertise and unique skill set that helped secure funding for this proposal.  2)  This effort requires a multi-disciplined team of researchers. The thin-film surfaces themselves are applied using chemical-engineering techniques, and an understanding of basic chemistry is at the heart of the self-assembly process. The interaction of the alkali atoms, which define the precise frequency of the clock, with the walls on which the thin-film surfaces are deposited requires an in-depth knowledge of the physics of the collision process.  Dr. Maclennan and his colleagues at the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal Materials Research Center (FLC MRC) at the University of Colorado in Boulder (CU) carry out research on liquid crystals and other self-assembled systems. They are uniquely qualified to carry out the research outlined.  In addition to Dr. McLennan they have a highly multidisciplinary team composed of experts from the areas of physics, chemistry, and chemical engineering. 3) Special Resources are required for this effort. The FLC MRC is a world leader in the field and has unique capabilities, equipment (rotating anode x-ray diffractometer and the ellipsometer for x-ray and optical reflectivity studies), facilities, and most importantly the experience that is necessary for preparing and assaying the coatings. 4) Proximity to the NIST Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado: The FLC MRC is uniquely qualified because it is located in Boulder, which will facilitate the safe transfer of the samples between their lab and NIST. The special surfaces to be delivered under this contract are prepared in a highly clean environment and must be transferred to NIST without contamination to ensure that the surface will perform adequately in the NIST lab.  In addition, and most importantly, it is known that the type of organic surface materials under consideration undergo aging processes that occur on a fairly quick time scale (minutes to days) and depend on their time, environment and temperature history. Therefore, it is imperative for NIST to evaluate the coatings soon after they are fabricated.   The FLC MRC lab at the University of Colorado is therefore uniquely qualified to carry out this research.  This notice may represent the only notice.  See note 22.

<SUBJECT>A -- Research support for
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the Department of Commerce to acquire a combined experimental/theoretical investigation of the sympathetic cooling of trapped Be+ and Mg+ ions to support its work on trapped-ion quantum computation from the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado.  The specific work described here is to carry out a key component of the division's contract with the National Security Agency/Advanced Research Projects Agency (NSA/ARDA) to build a prototype quantum information processor based on trapped ions. This project supports the broader NIST internally supported program in quantum information.  The project is comprised of the following tasks: (1) Set up of ion traps, lasers and ancillary equipment for laser cooling and quantum state manipulation of beryllium (Be+) ions and magnesium (Mg+) ions that are trapped in multi-zone linear rf traps, (2) Characterize the sympathetic cooling of Be+ ions by Mg+ ions (and visa-versa) in a single trap, (3) Characterize the sympathetic re-cooling of one ion species by the other after one ion species has been transferred from one trapping zone to another, (4) Carry out coherent quantum logic operations between ions located in one trap zone with those located in another trap zone through ion transfer and sympathetic re-cooling after transfer and (5) Compare experimental results with theoretical predictions.  The tasks described above need to be successfully completed in parallel with the other components of the quantum computation processor system. The period of performance is expected to consist of a basic one year contract and a 6-month option period.  The place of performance will be the NIST Boulder Laboratories.  Dr. Murray Barrett through the Physics Department at the University of Colorado is uniquely qualified to carry out this work in a timely fashion.  He possesses the following required skills: experience with single-frequency CW UV laser sources, high-vacuum technology, and the operation of RF ion traps.  He also has a background in trapping, laser-cooling, and quantum-state manipulation of beryllium and magnesium atomic ions and the construction of high-vacuum apparatus and laser systems required to work with these specific atomic species.  Dr. Barrett has already spent 10 months working on the preliminary theory and experiments for Be+ and Mg+ sympathetic cooling.   This notice may represent the only notice.  See note 22.
