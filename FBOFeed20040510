<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure services on a sole source basis from Netcomm, Inc., Rockville, Maryland. The purpose of this requirement is to obtain a digital version of the works of Hippocrates and other Classical physicians and have it mounted on the Perseus and the NLM Website. The project entails: 1) having Greek and English ( or French) versions of Classical medical works entered by keyboard, creating text files; 2) editing the text against paper copies of the texts; 3) marking up the text to produce TEI-encoded XML verisons, which can be used by Perseus and NLM to mount in searchable form on the World Wide Web. The base period of performance for this service is 06/01/04 to 05/31/05, with three (3) additional option years. Netcomm has extensive knowledge of NIH budget systems and has gained considerable experience developing Internet and Intranet solutions customized to several NIH organizations, e.g. NLM’s DIRLINE database. Netcomm development staff already has spent considerable time in the preliminary phases of this project and at this point is uniquely qualified to continue and complete this project. The introduction of another developer at this juncture would add needless cost to the project and extend the development period to accommodate the learning curve period. This would unnecessarily delay the system’s full implementation. This proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Acquisition of Non-Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statement  in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the  referenced services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice. NLM Synopsis No. NLM 04-133/CYC.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Cara Y. Calimano on (301) 496-6127.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, has a requirement for the study, evaluation, review, technical investigation and analysis of current and emerging knowledge and technology in selected areas of food processing, food safety, food security, and human health issues.  Three kinds of analysis/reviews shall be requested under the terms of this contract:  Comprehensive Reviews, Abbreviated Reviews, and Technical Investigation and Analysis for Potential Solutions.  The successful contractor shall be responsible for providing comprehensive reviews in the subject scientific areas and shall emphasize the essential components of an independent scientific review and evaluation.  The approach selected to address the topics identified by FDA for each Comprehensive Review shall emphasize the essential components of an independent scientific review and evaluation.  Every effort shall be made to minimize bias in the review of scientific information.  The final reports shall carefully document divergent scientific opinions.  The contractor shall prepare, within sixty days of initiation of each Comprehensive Review, a detailed Scientific Plan that describes a reasonable approach to address the scientific questions posed by FDA.   This plan shall take into account the complexities of the issues raised.   A project schedule shall be included in the Plan to indicate how the contractor shall organize the work to be performed for each Comprehensive Review.   In addition some abbreviated reviews are anticipated requiring rapid response and analysis and summaries of emerging issues in selected topics.       Abbreviated Reviews are intended to provide FDA with rapid analysis and summaries of emerging issues in the areas of food safety and health; they are normally completed within one to six months.   Requests for Abbreviated Reviews of selected topics shall be interspersed during the life of the contract.     The contractor shall prepare a written report summarizing the review and the conclusions or recommendations reached.   The basic types of Abbreviated Review activities that may be requested by FDA:   “Quick Response Actions on Request” shall address specific scientific issues such as the scientific merit of research proposals, new research, food processing and technological developments, and food safety and security concerns.  Predictive Response shall provide perspectives on issues in the field of food safety and security for approaching scientific areas of science evaluation, which are relevant to FDA’s mission.  Technical investigation and analysis of potential solutions to specific food safety or food security issues shall be requested under the terms of this contract.  These investigations involve a review of the food processing systems and activities and determination and validation of the preventive measures that can be applied by industry, particularly small and medium business, to eliminate or minimize a food safety hazard or food security vulnerability.  The contractor must have state-of-the-art knowledge on relevant scientific issues relating to food processing, food safety, food security, and human health.  The contractor must have a multidisciplinary scientific based organization that has experience and sufficient scientific expertise necessary to conduct research in the areas mentioned above.  It is anticipated that this requirement will result in an ID/IQ multi-year contract with task orders.  Many of the resulting task orders may be for research relating to bio-terrorism and or counter terrorism issues.  Because of the security issues involved in conducting this type of research it will be necessary to classify these projects as secret or top-secret.  It should be noted that any offeror interested in this procurement must possess the ability to obtain the necessary security clearances if they receive the contract.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.  Technical questions may be sent to the Contract Specialist, e-mail address or fax number contained herein, until fifteen (15) days after issuance of the RFP.  No responses to questions will be given after that date. (See Numbered Note 1)

<DESC>SUBJECT: _—JNTC BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT RELATED TO RAPID DISTRIBUTED DATABASE DEVELOPMENT (RD3) TO SUPPORT LIVE, VIRTUAL AND CONSTRUCTIVE (L-V-C) COMPONENTS OF A JOINT NATIONAL TRAINING CAPABILITY (JNTC) 
BAA#:  N61339-04-R-0031

United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) Joint Warfighting Center (JWFC) is collecting information for the research and development (R&D) of Advanced Training Technologies (ATT) that will enable Rapid Distributed Database Development (RD3) in support of establishing a robust Joint National Training Capability (JNTC).  USJFCOM is leading a DoD-wide effort to establish interoperability of various types of models and simulations among themselves and with Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems and data, order of battle data, force data, target data, geospatial data, visualization data, and other data required to support the development of common services and associated standard interfaces that will enable interoperability in training.   

The RD3 initiative is seeking technical solutions to the definition, design, development, and support of an integrated system for collecting, manipulating, storing, and retrieving data in a usable form to support anticipated future requirements for Joint planning, training, mission rehearsal, and experimentation.  The RD3 architecture shall support the reduction of development time for virtual and constructive databases to 3 - 4 days, to support Joint mission planning and rehearsal.  In order to achieve this performance objective, the architecture must allow distributed end-user participation in Live, Virtual, and Constructive (L-V-C) simulation and C4I federation database production processes relevant to the Joint Event Life Cycle.  The resulting system design must allow operational and technical users associated with a particular event to define and enter database production cases, rapidly assess the availability of authoritative representations of the operational environment (terrain, atmosphere, ocean, space and associated models of natural and artificial objects), weapons and warfighting platforms, friendly and enemy force structure, integrated target databases, and human and organizational performance.  The system must also allow the users to access data from archives of previously created scenario databases, perform data correlation and normalization across data types to a common baseline, support configuration management and control of the baseline, allow editing and validation of the baseline across an event community, and output the data in commonly used simulation and C4I formats (i.e. SEDRIS Transmittal Format, XML, etc) used for simulation federation engine initializations.  Additionally, common services include knowledge integration technologies and tools for data interchange, Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A), and life cycle support of RD3 system components.

USJFCOM is seeking information from Industry and Academia on all related Live, Virtual, and Constructive (L-V-C) enabling technology development efforts that could enhance RD3 in the areas of applications and tools (data generation, collection, transformation, and configuration management), data standards (import, export, distribution, archiving, and metadata), processes that promote interoperability, data storage, integration, real-time data updates, interfaces, and dataset production functional and life cycle processes, including dataset fusion, normalization, baseline control, and VV&A.

In support of USJFCOM’s R&D efforts, Naval Air Systems Command, Orlando Training System Division is announcing that a JNTC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA - N61339-04-R-0031) is released with a topic area focused on RD3 research and development.  This Broad Agency Announcement is intended to cover, in general, all R&D areas of interest for the JNTC Program and its customers.  Specific scientific points of contact for each research area will be identified on page 1 of the BAA, as well as a detailed process that allows for an early determination of the potential for interest based on technical merit, applicability to the JNTC Program, and projected funding.  This process is designed to limit offeror and Government expenditure of effort to prepare and review formal proposals for research that may have little chance of being supported and consists of a technical dialog (telephone call to scientific point of contact and informal white paper submission), followed by formal proposal submission and contract award.  

Those interested in performing research in the covered areas should download the BAA, and to assess organizational interest in the RD3 effort, interested firms are invited to receive a program briefing at the RD3 Industry/Academia Day forum and participate in a question and answer session.  All briefings will be unclassified.  Due to seating limitations, each interested firm is limited to no more than two representatives at the group meeting.  JFCOM plans to host the RD3 Industry/Academia Day meeting on or about June 8, 2004 in the Orlando, Florida Area.  Firms interested in attending the industry day must contact Benn Aaronson, NAVAIR-Orlando , at (407) 380-8250 (benn.aaronson@navy.mil) or Bill Wolfinger, NAVAIR Orlando, at (407) 380-4265 (bill.wolfinger@navy.mil) no later than May 21, 2004. 

To download a copy of the BAA, visit NAWCTSD’s Open Acquisitions webpage at http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/Ebusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm (click on Open Acquisitions) on or about May 6, 2004.  Be advised that periodic access to the website is essential for obtaining updated documentation and the latest information regarding this announcement.  Questions regarding the BAA process itself should be addressed to the point of contact listed below or in this announcement.  

Government organizations, commercial companies, universities, and other non-profit organizations capable of conducting appropriate research and development, in whole or part, are invited to submit an affirmative response to this announcement.  Following the briefing, interested parties will be requested to submit research and development recommendations/ideas under the JNTC BAA, in a white paper format (not to exceed ten pages in length, single-spaced, 12 point font minimum); as well as capability statements, catalogs, or their published literature that describes their research and development activities, products and product capability.  The white papers shall address at a minimum; RD3 related research, development, and demonstration ideas/capability; technical challenge that can be addressed; maturity of the M&S technology; previous experience with similar efforts; a point of contact; and a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate to implement the research effort.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN), San Diego intends to negotiate a sole-source contract modification with Science Application International Corporation, San Diego, CA under their existing contract N66001-99-D-8622.   This action will provide a one (1) year period of performance extension from 30 September 2004 through 30 September 2005 to allow sufficient time to release a competitive follow-on solicitation.    This modification will not result in an increase in contract ceiling.    This action will also revise the contract scope to add support for the Department of Homeland Security.    The original scope includes DoD agencies that engage in communication systems technology.   At the time of the original contract award, Homeland Security did not exist.   The communication needs in support of Homeland Security are considered similar to those for DoD. This action is a sole source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.   This is not a request for proposal and no solicitation is available.   Use of any other source for this modification would result in duplication of cost and time to develop the technical capability within another contractor's workforce resulting in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition as well as unrecoverable unacceptable delays. Questions concerning this sole source modification may be directed to Esther E. Christianson at esther.christianson@navy.mil.   See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits companies who are interested in a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize technology to produce hydrogen (H2) from green algae in the presence of oxygen.  Hydrogen production by green algae has significant advantages over other photobiological systems: high theoretical efficiencies and an inexpensive H2 source, water.  However, algal H2 photoproduction is sensitive to oxygen, a co-product of photosynthesis, and this sensitivity is a major factor currently limiting the use of algal systems for H2 production. NREL is investigating ways to solve this problem by focusing on genetically engineering a reversible [Fe]-hydrogenase (the enzyme that releases H2 gas). Previous studies indicate that site directed mutagenesis can be used to decrease the O2 sensitivity of the hydrogenase and thus eventually lead to a system that produces H2 under aerobic conditions, in the presence of oxygen.

NREL has several pieces of intellectual property in this area and is looking for a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize this technology. The alliance could be a license, a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), or a Work For Others (WFO) that leverages NREL’s unique capabilities, facilities, and personnel.  License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will be needed to view the patent applications associated with this technology.  Information on technology transfer is available on the NREL web site at http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/license.html.   
THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Organizations interested in commercializing NREL technologies will provide their own financial resources to commercialize the technology.  Any organization interested in licensing the above mentioned technology must contact us (per below) by email or hard copy briefly describing the organization’s technical expertise, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, financial resources (e.g., annual report or corporate resume) and proposed use of the technology.  Do not include any proprietary information in initial contact.  Please contact us by June 10th, 2004, to ensure consideration of your interest in the technology.  A business or product commercialization plan will be required from the potential licensee during the negotiations.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits companies who are interested in a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize technology to produce hydrogen (H2) from green algae in the presence of oxygen.  Hydrogen production by green algae has significant advantages over other photobiological systems: high theoretical efficiencies and an inexpensive H2 source, water.  However, algal H2 photoproduction is sensitive to oxygen, a co-product of photosynthesis, and this sensitivity is a major factor currently limiting the use of algal systems for H2 production. NREL is investigating ways to solve this problem by focusing on genetically engineering a reversible [Fe]-hydrogenase (the enzyme that releases H2 gas). Previous studies indicate that site directed mutagenesis can be used to decrease the O2 sensitivity of the hydrogenase and thus eventually lead to a system that produces H2 under aerobic conditions, in the presence of oxygen.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), operated by Midwest Research Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits companies who are interested in a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize technology to produce hydrogen (H2) from green algae in the presence of oxygen.  Hydrogen production by green algae has significant advantages over other photobiological systems: high theoretical efficiencies and an inexpensive H2 source, water.  However, algal H2 photoproduction is sensitive to oxygen, a co-product of photosynthesis, and this sensitivity is a major factor currently limiting the use of algal systems for H2 production. NREL is investigating ways to solve this problem by focusing on genetically engineering a reversible [Fe]-hydrogenase (the enzyme that releases H2 gas). Previous studies indicate that site directed mutagenesis can be used to decrease the O2 sensitivity of the hydrogenase and thus eventually lead to a system that produces H2 under aerobic conditions, in the presence of oxygen.

NREL has several pieces of intellectual property in this area and is looking for a strategic alliance to develop and commercialize this technology. The alliance could be a license, a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), or a Work For Others (WFO) that leverages NREL’s unique capabilities, facilities, and personnel.  License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will be needed to view the patent applications associated with this technology.  Information on technology transfer is available on the NREL web site at http://www.nrel.gov/technologytransfer/license.html.   
THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Organizations interested in commercializing NREL technologies will provide their own financial resources to commercialize the technology.  Any organization interested in licensing the above mentioned technology must contact us (per below) by email or hard copy briefly describing the organization’s technical expertise, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, financial resources (e.g., annual report or corporate resume) and proposed use of the technology.  Do not include any proprietary information in initial contact.  Please contact us by June 10th, 2004, to ensure consideration of your interest in the technology.  A business or product commercialization plan will be required from the potential licensee during the negotiations.  NREL reserves the right to reject any expressions of interest that are judged to be incomplete, unresponsive, or inappropriate for this opportunity.
Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to Richard Bolin, fax # 303-275-3040, or e-mail to Richard_bolin@nrel.gov.

<DESC>DESC: The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA), plans to award a sole source procurement to Joy Leap to assist the NOAA General Counsel Office for Enforcement and Litigation in the Southeast Region (GCEL/SE).  Ms. Leap has extensive experience needed for the services required.  She has previously worked for the General Counsel Office and has vested knowledge in enforcing federal fisheries laws including, but not limited to drafting legal documents, being familiar with the complex fisheries regulations and GCEL/SE case files and systems.  There are numerous Administrative Penalty hearings scheduled for the remainder of this year, with the anticipation of more being scheduled in the coming months.  The recent advent of several new permitting programs and increased use of mandatory vessel monitoring systems is creating an increase in permit application reviews and regulatory review work where Ms. Leap’s assistance is required.  Ms. Leap’s understanding and prior experience with the GCEL/SE office allows her to work without constant surveillance or the need for training.  It would take a considerable amount of time for both the GCEL/SE staff and a new person, to bring the new person to the level of understanding and effectiveness that Ms. Leap is able to provide.  The award will be made under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.   No Solicitation documents are available and requests for such will not be acknowledged.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

___________________________________


Introduction:

The U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS) collects detailed population and housing data to produce estimates of socioeconomic characteristics.  The data provided by the ACS throughout the decade corresponds to the data that the U.S. Census Bureau historically collected once every ten years during the decennial census. The Census Bureau began a full operational test of the ACS in four counties in October 1995 and added new counties each year through 2000.  Beginning in July 2004, we plan to expand the ACS by selecting an independent sample of approximately 240,000 addresses each month from all counties in the United States.  

Synopsis of Requirement:

The Census Bureau has a requirement for a contractor to use Census Bureau-provided rules to match approximately 240,000 sample addresses provided by the Census Bureau against the contractor=s address database to obtain a published telephone number for as many of the sample addresses as possible.  The contractor will be required to perform an exact match on basic street address, and, where present, on unit designation. The Census Bureau may require more than one contractor to match the same set of addresses because a second contractor may successfully match an address that the first contractor could not.  

The contractor will be required to provide the Census Bureau with a file in ASCII format of addresses (including ZIP+4) and matching current telephone numbers. The Census Bureau will determine the monthly file delivery schedule.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N61339-01-R-0023 was publicized in the CBD on 01 March 2001 by the U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (formerly STRICOM). This notice calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research interest entitled, “Battlefield Simulation Research: 1-B. Distributed Simulation Environments and Interoperability”.  Technical Points of Contact for this specific white paper submission: Ms. Sandy Veautour, PEO STRI, (407)384-3665, sandy.veautour@peostri.army.mil (email contact preferred). Contractual Points of Contact: NAVAIR-Orlando-TSD, Ms. Debra Leuschel, Contract Specialist, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 or Ms. Vanessa Dobson, Procuring Contracting Officer, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826. OBJECTIVE: Develop an initial open virtual simulation architecture (VSA) framework.  This VSA will be used by virtual simulation systems to facilitate interoperability and integration in current simulations and be the foundation on which all future virtual simulations will be constructed.  The VSA will be a foundation component of the Simulation Environment Core (SE Core) product line within the virtual domain and provide for interoperability with the Army’s Live Virtual Constructive Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA) and the Future Combat System (FCS). The framework will be used to support the development of virtual training systems across air, ground, and special operations requirements.  Additionally it will be used across individual, crew, collective, combined arms, mission rehearsal training missions. 

A phased approach to this effort is sought.  White papers should address a basic award (Phase 1) and one priced option (Phase 2) as stated below. 

PHASE 1.  The phase 1 effort will consist of research and development of an initial open VSA including all the of the development artifacts necessary to build a product line framework (i.e.: domain analysis, product line allocation, uses cases, etc.).  The VSA should be crafted using a product line framework with automated tools to allow viewing of the development artifacts for the architecture.  It is desired that Phase 1 provide a proof of concept of the identified VSA framework with respect to its implementation into current simulation products.  The VSA will consider all current virtual simulation systems and the future needs of the Army in training in a virtual environment such as Soldier CATT and Future Combat System (FCS). The current list of virtual simulations within PM CATT is provided with referenced documents.  Phase 1 should provide a logical grouping of these systems (i.e.: individual training, collective training, etc.). The VSA should be consistent with the DoD Architectural Framework policies and procedures.  The VSA will be used as the foundation for SE Core and all future virtual simulation systems. VSA will be used as the enabling framework for providing interoperability between current and future virtual simulation systems.  The VSA must consider the use of the Objective OneSAF System (OOS) within the virtual domain and CTIA-TENA as the architecture employed for live training in support of a seamless training environment. VSA must consider the database needs of all elements of virtual simulations.  

Phase 1 will be a 6 month effort and funding may consist of approximately $400,000.  


PHASE 2. The VSA will be used as the foundation architectural framework for the SE Core program and the development of its Key Performance Parameters. This phase will address evolution, refinement, and expansion of the Phase 1 framework to address specific needs in SE Core and how the VSA will be employed to address domain-wide common components (i.e.: Common Database Generation, Computer Generated Force (CGF), Instructor Operator Station (IOS), etc.)  

Phase 2 will be a 12 month effort and funding may consist of approximately $800,000.
 
There will be at least 2 mandatory formal technical interchange meetings during Phase 1 and Phase 2. Each white paper shall include a statement that the offeror agrees to: a) the formal exchange of technical information with other SE Core and PM CATT Programs, subject to signed non-disclosure agreements and b) participation in the interchange meetings.

Reference Documents are provided on the PEO STRI website at http://www.peostri.army.mi/BAA/VSA.

This announcement constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort. 

WHITE PAPERS: 
Any responsible offeror capable of satisfying the needs identified in this announcement may submit a white paper. White paper submissions are encouraged as early as possible but must be received at PEO STRI no later than 24 May 2004. No extensions will be granted. White papers must address requirements for both phases and shall not exceed 10 pages in length, excluding resumes. Only unclassified white papers will be accepted.  All white papers must include Phase 2 as a priced option.  The white papers will be reviewed to determine that the proposed effort is within the scope and interest of this solicitation.  A proposal will only be solicited from white paper deemed to best meet the program objectives. Subsequently, offerors will be notified whether or not their white paper was favorably received.  White papers will be evaluated by a technical review board using the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: (1) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal. (2) The potential contributions and/or transition of the effort to the Army simulation, training and instrumentation mission and the extent to which the research effort will contribute to high priority Army interests. (3) The qualifications and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to the achievement of the proposal objectives. (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.  (5) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any, and the availability of funds. Cost reasonableness and realism will be assessed, but this assessment is of a lower priority than the technical evaluation to be eligible for award a white paper must be submitted. Offerors will be notified whether or not their white paper was favorably received on or about 7 June 2004. Favorable review of a white paper does not constitute selection of the proposed effort for contract award and will not establish a binding commitment for the Government to fund the effort in whole or part. Upon notification, the Government will issue a request for proposal letter to the qualified offerors, who best meet the program objectives. If proposals are solicited, proposals are due NLT 7 July 2004.  The requirements for proposal preparation and submission can be found at http://www.peostri.army.mil/BAA/home.jsp.

This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the government to reimburse any proposal preparation cost for responding. The cost of proposal preparation in response to this announcement are not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect costs as specified in FAR 31.205-18. Any request for white paper or submission of a full proposal does not guarantee award. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time and shall not be liable for any cost of proposal preparation or submission. There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement. Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published. The white papers should be provided in hardcopy and electronic form.  MAIL WHITE PAPERS TO: US Army PEO-STRI, Attn: Ms. Sandy Veautour, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, Fl 32826 on or before 1200 EDT on 24 May 2004.

<DESC>Multnomah Falls Lodge Fire Suppression System.  The work shall generally consist of the design of mechanical and electrical systems.  This document describes Government needs and requirements for fire safety systems that exceed provisions outlined in the building codes, lists the type of work that will be expected and itemizes the format for submittals to the Government of work accomplished under this contract.  Included are project criteria and functional needs necessary for existing system status report review, the generation of modification proposals, alternative analysis, design and construction of an update/replacement for the fire sprinkler systems located at Multnomah Falls Lodge on the Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area.  The scope of work will consist of, but is not limited to, all aspects of professional design and installation services, including the generation of working drawings, system designs, engineering reports, alternative analysis, providing drafting services, contract packages, specifications, performing site investigations, construction of the designed systems, creating as-built drawings, producing operation and maintenance manuals and providing both warranty repairs and general maintenance.  Preservation of the historic fabric and character of the lodge is of the utmost importance.  The Work shall be conducted in four phases.  Phase One:  Site investigation and design of the mechanical, electrical and structural retrofit for the building.  Phase Two:  Construction of the design generated during phase one.  Phase Three:  As-built drawings, operation and maintenance manuals, final review and acceptance by the Forest Service.  Training of Forest Service personnel.  Phase Four:  Short and long term maintenance operations.  The project will be constructed under a general “design-construct” construction contract.  Bid project on a “Lump Sum” basis for a complete and operating system.  Should requirements be revised later, a Change Order shall be issued.  The project may be summarized as follows:  Design and Construct a retrofit for the existing Fire Sprinkler system at Multnomah Falls Lodge.  Provide a modern, efficient design, that meets current codes.  Preserve existing piping and equipment, as practical.  Include in project estimate, the resources for cleaning, servicing, testing or certifying and reinstalling any equipment designated to be preserved.  Design and Construct necessary civil improvements to the water system and water supply to facilitate all use points on the system (the lodge, campgrounds etc.), particularly the modified fire sprinkler system for the Lodge.  Design and Construct necessary electrical modifications to facilitate sprinkler system activation and operation.  Design a back-up generator system for the water system.  Design and Construct necessary structural modifications to facilitate existing sprinkler system removal and new sprinkler system installation and support.

<DESC>The following question was asked by a potential offeror.  The answer is being made available to all offerors.***QUESTION:  Why is Part 135 being required?  It does not seem to apply to this scope of work because we would not be transporting people and/or cargo for hire.  Would this not be a flight services contract under Part 91?  Please advise if NOAA is adamant about Part 135 certification. ***ANSWER:  NOAA does not require that Offerors hold 14 CFR part 125 or 135 certificates for this solicitation. As stated in the evaluation criteria, "It is desirable that the Offeror meet or exceed the requirements for aircraft, pilot, and operations safety as described in 14 CFR Parts 125 or 135 to the maximum extent possible,...". It is understood that it may be difficult to meet the part 135 standard while modifying an aircraft to meet the lidar requirements and that there are Offerors that adhere to high safety standards without having received the part 125 or 135 certificates. Therefore, the evaluation criteria and solicitation do not require part 125 or 135 certification of the Offerors, but do encourage and reward Offerors that achieve higher standards for safety. The solicitation does reference components of the 14 CFR 135 standards in order to more clearly specify the particular safety requirements that do need to be met for this contract.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis for FDA Electronic Submissions Gateway

This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. Responses to this publication are solicited to identify qualified sources. This is not a request for a formal proposal.  The anticipated NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541512 with a size standard of $21M.

This synopsis seeks to identify contractors that can provide the services described below.  The FDA anticipates award of a firm fixed price contract with a 15-month period of performance and a start date of no later than 09/01/2004. The major objectives to be accomplished under this contract are: 1) to determine system requirements; 2) to design the target architecture and 3) to support implementation contract procurement for the receipt and processing of PDUFA related regulatory application submissions through the use of a single point of entry.  In addition, the target architecture must provide for an extensible and scalable design such that additional non-PDUFA needs can be readily accommodated.  

In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) required that FDA move towards the goal of a paperless submission and review environment.  The regulatory reform initiatives in FDAMA and Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA II) mandated that CBER & CDER have the capability to receive all PDUFA-related regulatory submissions electronically by the year 2002.   More recently, PDUFA III has established the following goals in relation to Electronic Applications and Submissions (Section XII):

·	FDA will implement a common solution in CBER, CDER, ORA and OC for the secure exchange of content including secure e-mail, electronic signatures, and secure submission of, and access to application components.
·	FDA will deliver a single point of entry for the receipt and processing of all electronic submissions in a highly secure environment. This will support CBER, CDER, OC and ORA. The system should automate the current electronic submission processes such as checking the content of electronic submissions for completeness and electronically acknowledging submissions.
·	FDA will provide a specification format for the electronic submission of the Common Technical Document (eCTD), and provide an electronic review system for this new format that will be used by CBER, CDER and ORA reviewers. Implementation should include training to ensure successful deployment. This project will serve as the foundation for automation of other types of electronic submissions. The review software will be made available to the public.
·	Where common business needs exist, CBER, CDER, ORA and OC will use the same software applications, such as eCTD software, and COTS solutions.

FDA receives electronic submissions including IND, BLA, NDA, and IDE regulatory applications as well as their associated correspondence and other types of submissions defined by business units.  While many of these are received online, this project will support a unified FDA business solution.

With the increasing number of electronic submissions and the initial release of the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD), it is critical to automate and standardize the receipt and processing of these submissions.  The objective of the E-Submissions Gateway is to enable the receipt of guidance-compliant electronic submissions over the Internet and to integrate the processing of these submissions with the CBER and CDER environments (as well as extending to other FDA Center/Office needs).  This will enable the FDA to address (if not meet) the PDUFA III Electronic Applications and Submissions Goals of:

·	A single point of entry for the receipt and processing of all electronic submissions in a highly secure environment,
·	Automating the current electronic processes such as checking the content of the electronic submission for completeness and electronically acknowledging submissions,
·	Supporting the electronic submission of the eCTD.

The electronic submission process is defined as the receipt, acknowledgment (to the applicant/sponsor), routing, and notification (to a receiving Center) of the receipt of an electronic submission.

·	“Receipt” means transfer of a submission from a transaction partner’s system to temporary storage in the FDA Gateway.
·	“Acknowledgment” to the sender which includes a detailed submission log confirming what was sent from a transaction partner’s system and received by the Gateway.
·	“Routing” refers to delivering a submission (and corresponding log files) to a Center-level storage area and initiating a manual or automated load process (if established) to place a submission into a Center receiving system (e.g. CBER EDR, CDER EDR).
·	“Notification” of a submission’s arrival is made to those responsible for the Center receiving system.

These steps comprise the whole scope of electronic submission delivery.

Part of this task is the replacement of the current Gateway functionality.  The Gateway currently routes Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) to the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) in CDER and CBER for processing. 

The other element of this task is the integration of the receipt, acknowledgment, routing and notification procedures that need to be incorporated to fully automate the electronic submission process. The solution will have an impact on the current electronic submission receipt and processing.

A Word file will be posted to this website with graphics that show a high-level “Concept of Operations” indicating how the FDA Electronic Submissions Gateway provides support to internal and external stakeholders, and another that details the conceptual structure of the Gateway itself.
Potential contractors need to demonstrate the following capabilities to meet the requirements of the FDA's Electronic Submissions Gateway project.  The contractor should describe the adherence to system development life-cycle best practices and their ability to meet the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) Level 2 requirements.  Describe your understanding of the FDA electronic submission models and guidance, and expertise with needed software tools.  The contractor should provide information on past and present performance in areas of systems life cycle development and technical integration for corporate/enterprise level systems and programs in a government environment.  The contractor should also describe their capabilities in complying with the government's security certification and accreditation requirements.

The contractor should describe their ability to meet the following high-level goals that have been considered in the Gateway architectural design:
·	Enable transaction partners to submit guidance-compliant regulatory submissions (e.g. eCTD, Adverse Event Reports, eBLA and eIND) electronically to the FDA.
·	Expedite the submission of electronic submissions from transaction partners to the FDA using the Internet.
·	Provide a secure central point of receipt of electronic submissions for the Agency and the ability to route submissions to Center level holding areas in an automated fashion.
·	Support standards developed by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)
·	Provide seamless support for FDA electronic submission business processes.
·	Ensure confidentiality and integrity of e-submissions.
·	Enable audit trail capability and the generation of transmission logs for Agency – Industry transactions.
·	Provide a reliable e-submissions environment (e.g. available 99.5% 24x7x365).
·	Provide a scalable and high performance environment.
·	Support continuity of operations.
·	Maximize the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components.
·	Be based upon open standards.

Interested parties shall submit a capability statement not to exceed 10 pages, in Microsoft Word, no later than April 20, 2004 to the Contract Specialist via email at kminker@oc.fda.gov

Note: Responses must reference Request for Information (RFI) number 223-04-5504.

Request for copies of the RFP or other documents relating to this requirement will not be addressed.   No questions will be answered concerning this requirement until AFTER the RFP has been released.  Any questions received (via any medium including E-mail, Mail, Phone or Fax) before the RFP is released will be deleted/not addressed.

<SUBJECT>B -- Analysis of Grantee Evaluation Designs
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-OII-2004-TAH
<RESPDATE>051404
<CONTACT>See Description for Contact Information, See 'Description, Phone See Description, Fax See Description, Email See Description
<DESC>The purpose of this procurement is to assist the Department of Education (ED) with analysis of scientifically-based evaluation designs proposed by grantees under the Teaching American History (TAH) program.  Specifically, the contractor would work with ED staff to analyze evaluation plans submitted by grantees that have proposed to conduct rigorous, project-level evaluations.

Teaching American History grants support projects to raise student achievement by improving teachers' knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of traditional American history.  Grant awards assist local educational agencies (LEAs), in partnership with entities that have extensive content expertise, to develop, document, evaluate, and disseminate innovative, cohesive models of professional development.  By helping teachers to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of traditional American history as a separate subject matter within the core curriculum, these programs improve instruction and raise student achievement.  For additional information about the TAH program, please visit the program web site at http://www.ed.gov/programs/teachinghistory/index.html

As a result of the FY 2003 TAH grant competition, 39 grantees were approved to conduct a rigorous program evaluation of the effect of their individual grant on teacher performance or student achievement.  These evaluations are to be experimental or quasi-experimental in design.  Because experimental and quasi-experimental designs are technically and logistically very challenging to implement, the TAH program held a conference in January 2003 to provide grantees with additional training on scientifically-based evaluations.  Following that meeting, the TAH program office requested that grantees refine their evaluation plans to include more detailed information.  In many cases, grantees have not only refined their designs but have also proposed significant changes to their designs.  

The contractor would provide assistance to ED in three areas by (1) reviewing grantees' full application as well as their detailed or revised evaluation designs;  (2) providing 1-2 page written comments to ED on the strengths and weaknesses of each grantee's evaluation design commenting on the adequacy of the overall approach as well as components of the evaluation such as sampling, data collection, and analysis plans; and (3) where necessary, participating in teleconference with ED staff and grantees to resolve technical design or measurement issues.  ED estimates that approximately 15 grantees will require such teleconferences.  The estimated time for each call is 45 minutes.

ED will give preference to bidders who demonstrate the following expertise and experience:  1)  Preference for a contractor that has previous experience in working with grantees that are trying to conduct experimental or quasi-experimental evaluations; 2) Preference for a contractor that has previous experience in conducting experimental and/or quasi-experimental evaluations; 3)  Preference for a contractor that has conducted evaluations of teacher professional development, particularly in the area of history education; 4)  Preference for a contractor that has conducted evaluations or research in the subject area of history.

The deliverables are described below:

Task 1:  Analysis of Grantees' Evaluation Designs.  Subtask 1.1  Reporting on Strengths and Weaknesses of Grantees' Evaluation Designs.  By June 15, 2004, the contractor shall prepare 1-2 page reports for each of the 39 grantees' evaluation designs.  These reports will provide information to ED on the strengths and weaknesses of each grantee's evaluation design; comments on the adequacy of the overall approach; and comments on the components of the evaluation such as sampling, data collection, and analysis plans.  Deliverables:  Thirty-nine memos; one for each grantees' evaluation design.  Task 2:  Teleconferences.  By June 30, 2004, the contractor shall participate in 15 teleconferences with ED staff and grantees to resolve technical design or measurement issues.  Deliverables:  Fifteen teleconferences; each teleconference will be approximately 45 minutes in length.

Schedule of Deliverables.  Task 1 - Analyze strengths and weaknesses of each grantees evaluation design; Deliverables: 39 1-2 page reports; No. of Copies - 4; Due Date: June 15, 2004.  Task 2 - Teleconferences; Deliverables: 15 teleconferences (45 minutes each); Due Date: June 30, 2004.  

All responsible sources may submit a quotation that, if timely received, shall be considered by the agency.

<SUBJECT>59 -- BAA SCATTERABLE MEDIA
<DESC>General Information
Document Type: BROAD AREA ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA)
Classification Code:	A -- Research & Development
Description
AJ61  - Broad Agency Announcement for Air-Droppable, Scatterable Electronic Media 

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is soliciting proposals for emerging technologies for air droppable, scatterable electronic media.  This media will be used to disseminate information and could take the form of long range broadcast electronic media receivers (tools, instruments, implements) for AM/FM/UHF/satellite broadcast operations, satellite radios; miniaturized AM/FM broadcast transmitters; miniaturized loudspeakers; entertainment devices; game device technologies, greeting cards; telephony technologies; text messaging; or other media capable of receiving and/or transmitting Internet broadcast or commercial radio frequency signals.  The objective of this BAA is to provide USSOCOM a capability to disseminate information.  It is not the intent of this solicitation to establish new devices or facilities, rather, to identify institutions that have demonstrated integration and development capabilities and have the necessary facilities to meet the objectives described in this BAA.  


It is desired that such electronic media be: 1) deployable (ruggedized, robust in construction or packaging) from air-platforms, air-droppable, 2) self-powered (long-life battery, solar, friction dynamo, other), 3) lightweight, 4) trackable, 5) disguisable.  

 The following general aspects of scatterable media are of interest:  1) Miniaturization of media/transmitter/antennae/power source, 2) Ruggedized and hardened hardware, both in construction and packaging, able to withstand a variety of environmental conditions and temperatures, 3) Internet broadcast reception and transmission devices, 4) Other media applications such as Internet broadcast receivers and grouped telephones.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selection.  All are invited to submit a project proposal not exceeding 100 pages of text that describes the following:  1) The development and integration objective,  2) The development approach, 3) Related work by the investigator or proposer, 4) Anticipated contributions to USSOCOM programs, 5) An estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for up to a three year effort, 6) Proposed payment milestones and program schedule, and 7) A curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) appended with any supporting information, such as reprints, that will assist in the evaluation of the pre-proposal submission.  Additionally, all offers must identify any rights and restrictions that exist on their technical data, and all offerors are advised that restrictions on technology transfers outside of the U.S. will be imposed on all media created IAW this BAA.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to USSOCOM SOAL-KBA 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, MacDill AFB, FL 33621 (Attn.: H92222-04-R-0032) on or before 12:00 NOON, on 25 June 2004.  

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by USSOCOM.  Small businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for small business due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. The government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances.   

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  1) Practical application and operational technical merits of the proposed media development,  2) Demonstration of current emerging development model device, 3) Qualifications and experience of the principal investigator(s), and availability of facilities to support and conduct the media development and integration,  4) Relevance of the proposed media application to USSOCOM program priorities, 5) Realism of the proposed costs.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists. 

The Government may award single or multiple contracts in accordance with technical priority and funding availability.  The government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government reserves the right to select for award, all, some, or none of the parts of a proposal from proposal respondents. Proposals may be selected and/or award decisions made without discussions or negotiations.     

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE: There will be no other requests for proposals or other formal solicitations regarding this announcement. 

Solicitations will be provided upon request.

<SUBJECT>D -- Request for Information - Procurement / Sourcing Capability for DoD
<DESC>NOTE:  PLEASE SEE PARAGRAPH 6 BELOW REGARDING POINT OF CONTACT FOR QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES IN REGARD TO THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.


1.  INTRODUCTION:  

a.  This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Department of Defense is not seeking proposals, and will not accept any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party’s expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP.  If an RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this and any other pertinent website for additional information pertaining to this requirement.

b.  The RFI process will be conducted in two phases.   The first phase is a request for information only and will allow the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) team to select representative candidates from each category for estimating program cost and effectiveness.  As part of the first phase, the AoA team may conduct an information exchange meeting with representative companies under each of the alternatives cited in Paragraph 2, below.  It is anticipated that these meetings will take place in the July timeframe.  The second phase will be a request for cost and pricing data from the representative candidates under each alternative.  As stated in Paragraph a., this does not constitute an RFP.  Life cycle costing information will strictly be used as an aid in ascertaining a Government estimate for these candidate representative solutions as a means to completion of the required Economic Analysis.  .

2.  PURPOSE:  The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to support an AoA for the sourcing/procurement capability of the Department of Defense (DOD).  The Government is looking for information in four categories:  (1) firms that have the resources (hardware, software, people, facilities) available which would allow the Government to out-source the capability; (2) Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) or Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) products capable of fulfilling DOD’s needs; (3) a combination of categories (1) and (2); and (4) development of a solution that would fulfill DoD’s sourcing needs within the stated timeframe.

3.  BACKGROUND:  As part of the Acquisition Domain’s transformation initiative and in support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Business Management Modernization Program (BMMP), an AoA for the Acquisition Domain, sourcing/procurement process has been launched.  This AoA is in support of a Milestone A decision (Concept Refinement Phase).  In conjunction with this effort, OSD will assess and define required Acquisition Domain capabilities and develop an Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) with JROC (Joint Requirements Oversight Council) approval/validation.  The AoA will assess suitable IT alternatives for the future Acquisition Domain capabilities identified in the ICD.  This is a significant Domain undertaking -- one that will serve to shape and directly influence the way the DOD does business in the future.  The AoA is being led by the Air Force on behalf of OSD; however, it is a joint effort with representatives from the Military Departments and Defense Agencies.

The DoD Acquisition Domain (Sourcing) (DADS) initiative, as envisioned, will enable the DoD to acquire services, supplies, construction, and financial assistance in support of its mission in a standardized, seamless, end-to-end (E2E) shared data environment.  DADS will also support mission related assistance through the use of such instruments as grants and cooperative agreements.

4.  TIMEFRAMES:  For planning purposes, the AoA being conducted is in support of a Milestone A (Concept Refinement Phase) decision scheduled for December 2005.   

a.  Based upon this schedule, it is anticipated that vendors responding to capabilities described under Categories 1 and 2 in Paragraph 2, above, will be deployed in mid-2010.  

b.  For responses to capabilities described under Categories 3 and 4, in Paragraph 2, above, the Government will entertain a spiral/modular solution with an initial deployment.  Responses in these two categories should indicate the timeframe to complete deployment of the full operational capabilities. 

5.  CAPABILITIES:  Attachment A is the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) setting forth the required capabilities.  The following paragraphs synopsize this document.  Websites containing information referenced herein, and in the ICD, are contained in Paragraph 8.  Those responding to this request,  must categorize responses by identifying capabilities that currently exist, capabilities currently under development, and capabilities that can be planned and scheduled.  For each of these three categories, responses are expected to address each subparagraph below.  All responses must be accompanied by a plan addressing the approach, including a schedule, which describes the candidate technology and proposed approach for the DoD Sourcing environment, method of supply/delivery  (e.g. full delivery or spiral delivery with proposed approach to provide full capability). training, deployment, maintenance and sustainment.  Responses are not to exceed the maximum equivalent of 75 pages, including schedules.

For those solutions currently in use within the Federal Government, provide the names of the agencies, the approximate number of users of the system, and a point of contact at the agency.  In addition, briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant (not to exceed the equivalent of 5 pages).  Address and provide a full description of any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach, security requirements, security assurance processes, and any relevant lessons learned (not to exceed the equivalent of 2 pages per project).


a.  The solution must include a database, document generator and document manager capability (produce and manage documents by accessing data in the database) and must contain a flexible, near real-time and batch interface capability to both internal and external systems.

b.  The solution must facilitate improved acquisition cycles such that single transaction data entry is utilized to ensure data consistency throughout the entire solution and the time/steps to generate/process an action are minimized.  As part of this capability, the solution must provide the most streamlined method of generating, processing and tracking sourcing actions through an automated routing and/or automated population means.
 
c.  The solution must execute DoD acquisition instruments, business rules and formats (including but not limited to: FAR/DFARS, non-FAR, DoDGAR, non-appropriated funds (NAF) instruments, Government-wide Purchase Card transactions)

d.  Standard shared data must be available through the entire acquisition process from the development of an acquisition strategy to the final disposal of property and archiving of records.

e.  The solution must be interoperable with other appropriate systems such as foreign or domestic partners (e.g., finance, logistics, contractors/vendors), without the use of specialized networks.  It must provide data interaction across DoD sourcing communities/users.

f.  The solution must accommodate automated closeout activities.

g.  The solution must be supportable and useable. In support of this item, provide a supportability/usability plan which addresses elements such as Section 508 compliance, operating in contingency/fleet and remote conditions, records management as defined in DOD STD 5015.2, NARA.

h.  The solution must comply with the requirements of the Global Information Grid (GIG) architecture and must meet Government accreditation and certification standards such as JITC and CJCSI 6212.01B.

k.  The solution must provide data integrity to include traceability/auditability of related data elements (e.g., funds tracking, item stock numbers, etc.) at all levels.

l.	The solution must accommodate analysis of data and permit standard, as well as
 ad-hoc, query report options.

m.  In order to provide data for the agency's data warehouse and Business Intelligence capabilities, the agency requires complete access to all data created and/or stored by the proposed solution.  In addition, a complete description of the data stored by the application, whether as a data dictionary or as metadata, will be required. Access to the data, and a description of the data, are required to support routine extractions and movement of the information into the agency's data repositories.

6.  Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted, in writing by E-MAIL ONLY, to Joe Ford at mailto:joe.ford@hill.af.mil. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted.

These services are covered by an exclusive franchise agreement covering a fifteen-year period (1 NOV 1995 through 31 OCT 201 0) between and the County of Monterey for the collection, transportation, recycling, and disposal of solid waste.  The basis for limiting competition is the limit placed on availability of eligible sources by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCR A) as interpreted by GAO and the 1988 Circuit Court of Appeals. The court held that the Army and Navy were to comply with the County of Monterey regulation requiring the use of the service provider under exclusive franchise with the county.  Therefore, thi s requirement will not be competed.

*** CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR)
Effective October 1, 2003, all vendors that do business with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Federal Government must be registered in CCR.  Contractors are strongly encouraged to register with CCR now to avoid payment delays.  

Changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) require, among other things, that contractors be registered in the CCR before award of any contract, basic agreement, blanket purchase agreements, or basic ordering agreement can be made, and that contract payments and/or new awards will be conditioned on CCR registration.  The FAR change will also require that contractors with existing contracts that require performance after September 30, 2003, register in the CCR.  There are 5 exceptions to the CCR registration requirement, including purchases that use the government-wide purchase cards as the purchasing mechanism, certain emergency operations and urgent procurements, certain purchases where CCR registration could jeopardize national security, and awards to foreign vendors for work performed outside the United States. 

The preferred method for completing a registration is via the World Wide Web at http://www.ccr.gov.  There, a CCR Handbook is available to provide detailed information on data you will need prior to beginning the on-line registration, as well as steps to walk you through the registration process.  You must have a DUNS number in order to begin your registration.  If you do not already have a DUNS number, please call Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., at 1-866-705-5711 or  610-882-7000. There is no cost to obtain a DUNS number.

<DESC>The Metrohm Acid Titrimeter System must have the capabilities for ISO accreditation. It is considered desirable to the ATF that data generation and comparison of identical samples for quality assurance purposes with other ATF labs be possible. This will allow all labs to follow the same ISO accreditation operational methods. Past performance is one of the evaluating factors for this best value procurement. To evaluate past performance two references must be submitted that the vendor used within the past two years that received your proposed product with a good point of contact and phone. Questions that will be asked are; when you used the vendor did they deliver the product in a timely matter? Would you be willing to use the vendor again, if the need arises? Would you highly recommend the vendor’s product to any other business? Has the product in question performed to all the specifications as advertised? Did the product exceed your expectation? How would you describe the business relationship with the company? If there are no relevant references in the past two years the rating will be neutral. This requirement has been extended thru May 14, 2004. All interested parties must submit a revised quote no later 3:00 PM EST

<DESC>QUESTION AND ANSWER:  (QUESTION 1) On the Runway, are seven conductors required? If so, how many are power, communication, and ground? (ANSWER 1) As per the product description, seven conductors are required.  All are power. (QUESTION 2) The Bridge is calling out nine conductors, how many are power, communication, and ground? (ANSWER 2) nine conductors are power, one conductor is equipment ground. (QUESTIONS 3) Is the installation in a “harsh” environment? (ANSWER 3) The installation is NOT in a harsh environment. (QUESTION 4) I need to verify by the Gov. spec that this can be two housings run side by side one 4 pole and one 3 pole to get the 7 poles required.  I am not aware of a single PVC housing that contains 7 independent continuous copper conductors. (ANSWER 4) As per the product description, each PVC housing must have a minimum of 7 independent continuous copper conductors.  The copper conductors must be  the length of the run not just the length of the housing.  Examples of manufacturers providing products that support a single PVC housing that contains 7 independent continuous copper conductors are:  Aero-Motive, Vahle, Wampfler, etc. (QUESTION 5) Contractor wants to know if  the length is the total amount, or if the length should be multiplied by the quantity to get the total amount. (ANSWER 5) Qty 15 individual runways that are 372 feet each - Qty 15 feed rails 372 feet long; Qty 10 individual bridge feed rails that are 100 feet each - Qty 10 feed rails 100 feet long; and Qty 20 individual bridge feed rails that are 50 feet each - Qty 20 feed rails 50 feet long.

<DESC>The following technical question was submitted. The following government response is also provided. QUESTON Your requirement states that you are requesting the DVCS to have 8 channels scaleable to 32 (within a chassis) with an option for an additiona l 8 channels (Option 9). How many of your DVCS systems (5 total) require the Time recording  specified in the C.3.1.3 Data Recording Section. How many channels from each of those systems. We configure our Time Recording capabilities separately into a Data Reduction system which will increase recording performance, allow multiple time sessions per test, and record directly to the PC disk without the need for downloading it. The systems will work together as one (through status and COLA channels) and will giv e you the best performance.  As such, we have many ways to deliver this. 1. We could match every DVCS with its own Data Reduction system (double the channels and higher cost) 2. We could deliver 2 Data Reduction systems (8 ch) to be used with any DVCS (mos t flexibility and the channels can be put into 1 frame for larger tests) 3. We could deliver 1 Data Reduction system (16 ch) to be used with any DVCS (covers high channel needs, but only 1 frame to work with 1 DVCS at a time). RESPONSE The Options 9, 8 cha nnel addition is an incremental upgrade from the base 8 channel system to the maximum of 32 channels. It is anticipated that a minimum of one DVCS will be equipped with 32 channels for multichannel data acquisition requirements. As indicated in paragraph C .3.1.3, Statement of Work the DVCS requires the capability to independently perform the time waveform recording and associated control. Thus, the option 1 above (with 8 channel recording) will meet the base statement of work requirement. Identification of the additional hardware cost is suggested to evaluate the proposal accurately. An alternate proposal may be submitted for evaluation, such as optional hardware for 8 channel time waveform recording with an incremental additional channel cost. This QUESTION  and RESPONSE is also located at web site www.yuma.army.mil/contracting/rfp.html for review.
