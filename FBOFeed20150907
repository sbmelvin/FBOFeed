DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIREMENT:  

GORE® VIABAHN® Endoprosthesis

The requested items are to be provided to Veterans at the Birmingham VA Medical Center, Birmingham, AL.

This request is written with the specification of BRAND NAME OR EQUAL to the currently used items at the participating VAMC's. If any interested potential offerors can meet the below specifications BRAND NAME OR EQUAL to the currently used items, please respond to this SS with enough information to demonstrate that these specifications can be met.

Interventionalists treating patients suffering from Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) in the Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) require a flexible stent-graft capable of re-lining tortuous arteries. The GORE® VIABAHN® Endoprosthesis is constructed with a durable, reinforced, biocompatible, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) liner attached to an external nitinol stent structure. Its flexibility enables it to better traverse tortuous areas of the SFA and conform more closely to the complex anatomy of the artery. 

The GORE® VIABAHN® Endoprosthesis with PROPATEN Bioactive Surface is approved for endovascular grafting of the peripheral arteries. The latest interventional product offering from W. L. Gore & Associates, the stent-graft features the addition of proprietary heparin-bonded technology to the proven combination of ePTFE and nitinol. End-point covalent bonding keeps heparin anchored to the endoprosthesis surface while the bioactive site remains free to interact with the blood.

<p>8. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Based in Monrovia, Liberia</p>
<p>9. JOB DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Specialist<br />10. BASIC FUNCTION OF POSITION</p>
<p>Although significant challenges remain, Liberia's health has made substantial progress since the civil war ended in 2003. Liberia's civil wars, which spanned 1989 to 2003, decimated basic infrastructure, including water and sanitation, electricity, roads, education, and health services - factors that contributed to the spread of disease and premature mortality. More than a decade following the end of the conflict, Liberia still remains among the poorest countries in the world, facing significant public health challenges as well as weak systems for delivering basic health services. Supply chain systems remain weak leading to recurrent stock-outs of basic supplies and medications, availability of skilled health workers is still low by regional standards, management capacity at all levels remains thin, and service provision in many areas is dependent on support from donors and NGO partners. Health systems weaknesses were among the factors that enabled the 2014 Ebola outbreak to quickly escalate into a full-scale national emergency, and threatening to further reverse years of progress made in improving the health status of Liberians. <br /><br />The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Specialist will join the Mission Health Team which presently consists of 14 positions including three US Direct Hires (USDHs), and a combination of US and Third Country National (TCN) Personal Services Contractors (US/TCN PSCs), and locally engaged Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs). The team is organized into two sub-teams, each headed by a USDH Foreign Service Officer: the Service Delivery Sub-team, and the Health Systems Strengthening Sub-team. The Health Systems Strengthening Sub-team leads management of the Mission's flagship wrap-around technical assistance activity, Collaborative Support for Health Systems Strengthening (CSH), and coordinates the health portfolio's WASH activities which cut across both the Service Delivery and the Health Systems Strengthening Sub-teams. The Service Delivery Sub-team leads management of a Government-to-Government (G2G) Fixed Amount Reimbursement Agreement (FARA) the Ministry of Health (MOH), as well as a diverse portfolio of technical assistance and support in cross-cutting areas of primary health care service delivery including maternal/reproductive and child health. In addition, the health portfolio has a strong and extensive President's Malaria Intiative (PMI) that, coupled with the Global Fund investment, covers the entire country.</p>
<p>The Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (M&amp;E) position will join the Health Office at USAID/Liberia to oversee and coordinate the monitoring and evaluation of all health program activities in Malaria, Maternal &amp; Child Health (MCH), Family Planning &amp; Reproductive Health, HIV/AIDS, Ebola, and health systems strengthening. The Office of Health's monitoring and evaluation functions include, but are not limited to: project performance monitoring (including participation on an advisory level in the Ministry of Health's stewardship and M&amp;E oversight); program level data gathering/validation; trend monitoring and reporting; implementation of public health evaluations and special studies; and strengthening of health management information systems, national surveillance systems and population based surveys. The specialist will be an integral member of the Health team providing leadership and technical guidance to effectively monitor and evaluate the full range of program progress and results.</p>
<p>The M&amp;E Specialist will also serve as the Program Office liaison on behalf of the Health Team around monitoring, evaluation, and learning. The Specialist will lead planning, logistics and implementation of key programmatic activities, such as the annual performance plan and report, operational plan, annual and semi-annual reporting (including USAID's PPR, ad-hoc reporting required for special initiatives, etc.), monthly Congressional mandated reporting for Ebola activities, partners' M&amp;E plans, work-plan reviews, and health portfolio review. The M&amp;E Specialist will also interact closely with the broader health team; the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) members, and the interagency Ebola Team and will collaborate on programmatic responses from headquarters. The Specialist will interact with the Government of Liberia (GOL), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the private sector, USAID implementing partners, and any other key stakeholders involved in health programming. The Specialist will also lead the development, streamlining and implementation of strategic processes, tools and systems across the board for the Health Office.</p>
<p>The Specialist is expected to complete assigned duties with little direct supervision and will work extensively through diverse teams. While the incumbent will report directly to the Health Team Leader, he or she is expected to work closely and collaboratively with the Service Delivery and Health Systems Strengthening Sub- teams as appropriate.</p>

<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is&nbsp;541519 with a size standard $27,500,000.00.</p>
<p>This is a brand name requirement. This solicitation is for National Instruments equipment and software. Only quotes from authorized resellers will be accepted.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA: <br />The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the lowest price Offeror meeting technical acceptability requirements. This is a brand-name requirement and substitute products will not be considered. <br />DUE DATE FOR QUOTES<br />***The due date and time for receipt of quotations is&nbsp;September 11, 2015 no later than 12:00PM EST. The offeror shall hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>

Only information received on or before the due date and time shall be considered for award. Any quotation, or part thereof, received after the due date and time, shall be deemed late and not considered for award.<br /><br />Background: <br />This procurement supports the Real-Time Control of Additive Manufacturing Processes project as part of the Measurement Science for Additive Manufacturing program in the Engineering Lab (EL) at NIST..<br />The Production Systems Group (PSG) is developing a laser-based metal powder bed fusion additive manufacturing metrology and process control testbed to incorporate and test various in-process sensing and real-time process control algorithms. To implement such a testbed, PSG needs a PC-based modular instrumentation and control platform, which will interface with multiple sensors, including high-speed cameras, for data acquisition and feedback, as well as connect to external motion controllers and provide appropriate user interface.</p>
<p>The Following Section 508 Standards apply: <br />Technical Standards: <br />&sect; 1194.21 Software applications and operating systems.<br />&sect; 1194.3(c) The installation of specific accessibility-related software or the attachment of an assistive technology device is not required at a workstation of a Federal employee who is not an individual with a disability. (e.g. not every computer will be equipped with a refreshable Braille display).<br /><br /><br />Brand Name Justification:<br />This is a request for a brand name procurement specifically for the purchase of National Instruments equipment and software. Since the multiple components have to be interfaced among themselves as well as with the components that are already in existence in the NIST laboratory to be used for process sensing and control, the new modular platform has to be compatible with the existing data acquisition system hardware, which are from National Instruments, as well as the software (LabView), which is also a National Instruments product.</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide firm-fixed-pricing for the PC-based modular instrumentation and control system.<br /><br />Please provide a quotation for the following: <br /><br />CLIN 0001 through CLIN 0022. See attached Specifications.</p>

However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists; offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine price reasonableness.</p>
<p>(e) Specific Instructions:</p>

<p>PART II- PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION - Present and past performance information will be used to determine satisfactory performance of the services proposed.</p>

<p>(c) Past Performance Information: The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of an offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation.

<p>11. The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with its addenda:</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2</p>
<p>(a) The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government with price and past performance considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Price and Past Performance. Past Performance shall be graded on an "acceptable or unacceptable" basis. The following table details what will deem an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" rating:</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT TABLE</p>
<p>Rating Description<br />ACCEPTABLE Based on the offeror's past performance and record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />UNACCEPTABLE Based on the offeror's past performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p><br />If the lowest priced quote has a past performance of unacceptable, the Government will evaluate the next lowest offeror and so on until an awardee is identified. The award will be made to the lowest evaluated price with an acceptable past performance assessment.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom<br />information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past<br />performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or<br />unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be<br />determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
