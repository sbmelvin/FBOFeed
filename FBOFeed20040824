<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) intends to award a contract on a sole source based to the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, for continuation of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive which was established in 1998.  Over the past five years, the Substance Abuse and Mental health Data Archive (SAMHDA) has become one of SAMHSA’s most visible, effective and interactive means of communicating with the general public, policy makers, researchers, and the media.  The Archive provides immediate access not only to data collected by OAS but also to important data sets developed by CSAT, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Institute of Drug Abuse.  The Archive also provides immediate access to the major publications of OAS.  In the five years since it was first introduced, the Archive has become the largest single resources for data in the fields of mental health and substance abuse.  Measured by the number of times individuals connect with the Archive site, SAMHDA was used more than 300,000 times in the past year; approximately 70,000 files were down-loaded in the past year to allow users to develop their own tables and charts.  The statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(C)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) - only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement is determined to be available from only one source because of the unique nature of the data archive.  No other organization is able to provide these required elements as specifically requested.  As a result, SAMHSA has determined that award to any other source would likely require a significant reduction in desired effectiveness of the Archive resulting in an unacceptable probability of failure, and resultant costs to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition.

<CONTACT>PATRICIA GREEN, (202) 385-8612
<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT OF A DECISION TO CONTRACT WITH RAYTHEON COMPANY, ON A SINGLE SOURCE BASIS, FOR THE ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL INTEGRATED TERMINAL WEATHER SYSTEMS (ITWS) This Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announcement is made pursuant to Section 3.2.2.4 of the FAAâ€™s Acquisition Management System to advise interested parties of the FAAâ€™s decision to acquire the ITWS from a single source, Raytheon Company. The FAA has a requirement to procure, deliver, install, and test eleven (11) additional NAS-certified, operational, and four (4) support ITWS that will include non-recurring engineering tasks, and three (3) additional Situation Displays (SD).  This requirement also includes the incorporation of the Terminal Convective Weather Forecast (TCWF) product into the production ITWS that will include the hardware retrofit of previously installed sites to increase processing and display capabilities, ensuring compliance with FAA-G-2100G, Electronic Equipment, General Requirements; the continuation of logistics support to include Interim Contractor Depot Level Support (ICDLS) function; and Engineering Support Services (ESS).  A system is NAS-certified after meeting the requirements in FAA Order 6000.15D, General Maintenance Handbook for Airway Facilities. Acquisition of ITWS is required to fulfill the FAAâ€™s Terminal Automation mission needs for the Terminal Radar Approach Facilities (TRACONs), Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), and Air Traffic Control Towers (ATCTs).  The FAA requires that ITWS be deployed to the first site, the Detroit TRACON, in the Spring of Fiscal Year 2005.  The procured systems will be produced in accordance with FAAâ€™s Integrated Terminal Weather System (ITWS) Specification, FAA-E-2900E, dated September 30, 2003. Since Raytheon developed the ITWS under PHASE I and procured, delivered, installed, and tested seven (7) operational and four (4) support systems under PHASE II of FAAâ€™s current contract, DTFA01-97-C-00006, the NAS-certified ITWSâ€™ are readily available for deployment in time to meet the required TRACONs' schedules.  Because of these unique qualifications, Raytheon Company is the only known vendor with a NAS-certified, operationally suitable system and is, therefore, the only source capable of meeting the interim requirements in a timely and cost effective manner.   Therefore, the FAA intends to award a fixed-price/cost-plus-fixed-fee modification to contract DTFA01-97-C-00006 to procure a total of fifteen (15) ITWS and three (3) SD; incorporate TCWF; provide ICDLS support/engineering services; and extend the contractâ€™s period of performance to December 31, 2009, for an estimated contract value of $38.93M

This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the requirements for contractor services in support of the NFC XML Documentation and On-Line Help Pilot, as described in this document.
BACKGROUND: 
NFC¡¦s EPS is an integral component in providing documentation services to NFC customers. The EPS is a highly complex system that encompasses hardware, software, and connectivity components from a wide range of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) and as such, has required an extremely complex and detailed systems integration effort for its implementation. Specifically, the EPS environment includes the following:

Hardware, System Software, and Connectivity 
EPS hardware includes IBM RS/6000 servers with IBM RAID subsystems; SUN UltraSPARC power user workstations; Windows 2000 Wintel Clients; and a wide range of general and task specific printing, plotting, and dedicated production equipment. EPS operating system environments include IBM AIX v5.L, Sun Solaris 8 (SPARC and x86), and Microsoft Windows 2000. All Wintel Clients support native Windows applications, client/server LAN applications, and host based UNIX and mainframe applications via X-Windows emulation and TN-3270, respectively. Networking equipment includes Cisco Level 3 switches, routers, and dedicated WAN connections. The departmental LAN is TCP/IP 100base-T based, with routed links to; the site wide Gigabit fiber backbone, the public Internet, and intranet WAN connections. The EPS networking environment supports connectivity with an IBM ¡§Z¡¨ series mainframe system, Windows Active Directory based SMB servers, UNIX NFS based servers, and the NFC enterprise-wide Novell LAN infrastructure. Multi-Level authentication and authorization is a function of UNIX NIS, Windows Domain management, and Novell LDAP services. Hardcopy production equipment includes Xerox DocuTech high volume production printers with a wide-range of in-line finishing options, Xerox DigiPath and Epson scanning sub-systems, Canon high performance CLC color printers with PostScript RIPs and centralized production control workstations, Canon and ColorSpan large format color plotters, and mid-range black and white departmental printers from Hewlett-Packard, and Xerox. All printers support direct LAN connection via TCP/IP 100base-T Ethernet, and hostname resolution is accomplished via centralized DNS servers.
Application Software
EPS application software includes a wide-range of general and task specific software solutions running under IBM AIX, Sun Solaris, and/or Microsoft Windows 2000. Key applications are configured to interoperate across multiple hardware/software platforms. Specific application packages supported by the NFC EPS include: Broadvision/Interleaf Quicksilver technical publishing software; Quicksilver, Microsoft Word 2003, ArborText, and XMLSpy XML authoring applications; XMLSpy and XML Authority XML Schema Design tools; Broadvision/Interleaf DemandPrint 2 demand print management Software; SunONE Web Server Enterprise Edition 6; Communigate Pro e-mail server; Adobe Illustrator, Adobe PhotoShop, and Paint Shop Pro graphic design applications; Elixir and Formatta forms development solutions; Macromedia DreamWeaver and Adobe Acrobat web publishing applications; Crunchy Technologies Page Screamer, Cast Bobby, and IBM Page Reader Section 508 compliance tools; FH Premier context sensitive help authoring tools; TechSmith SnagIt screen capture facility; and Microsoft Office 2000 and Office 2003 desktop productivity suites.

OBJECTIVE: NFC requires contractor support services to implement XML publishing extensions to the NFC Electronic Publishing System (EPS), as described in the section below, titled XML Document Publishing Architecture, and create a mechanism for converting existing document based information to non-proprietary XML formats. XML specific EPS functionality will include: XML document Authoring with an XML compliant COTS authoring tool, XML document management, Bill-of-Materials based document assembly, and dynamic re-purposing of XML based content, to generate all required document information deliverables. Document deliverables supported by the XML pilot will include: HTML documents, PDF documents, and web based on-line help for NFC developed applications.
SCOPE: This SOW is to acquire the required contractor support services to implement enhancements to the NFC EPS and complete the XML Pilot on or before September 30, 2004. The contractor will provide on-site support at NFC¡¦s facility located in New Orleans, Louisiana.  
XML DOCUMENT PUBLISHING ARCHITECTURE: The EPS XML Document Publishing Architecture (XDPA) will consist of a combination of existing NFC IT resources, COTS applications, and open source document processing technologies. The solution will be platformed on, and implemented as an extension of, the NFC Electronic Publishing System (EPS) and GESB web publishing infrastructure. Specific solution components will include:  
Document Content Authoring
All GESB document content will be authored and managed in XML using XML enabled desktop authoring applications. Specific authoring tools will be selected after a thorough review of available COTS products. Leading contenders include Microsoft Word 2003, Broadvision Quicksilver, and XMLSpy Authentic.
Document Content Management
GESB's XML solution will store XML instance documents in a managed document repository integrated with the XML authoring tool. The planned solution will support two types of XML formatted documents:
ƒÞ	Documentation Topic documents that contain help content and supporting metadata for a single NFC application screen or lower level Unit of Work (UOW), and

ƒÞ	Publication Bill-of-Materials documents that define Documentation Topic assembly criteria for the generation of serialized documentation deliverables.
Help content stored in each Documentation Topic document will include field level roll-over help, field level stick-up help, and Unit of Work level help for the associated application screen or lower level UOW. 
Document Deliverable Generation
Document deliverables will be dynamically assembled, transformed, and formatted from stored XML document content using open source document processing technologies, including XSLT (eXtensible Style Language Transform), XSL-FO (eXtensible Style Language Formatting Objects), and Apache FOP (Formatting Objects Processor).
XSLT, XSL-FO, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) transformation and formatting definitions will be authored and tested by GESB publishing specialists using desktop XML design and prototyping tools such as XMLSpy. 
Supported documentation deliverables will include: single topic HTML and PDF web site content, serialized publication PDF data, and web based help collection HTML formatted content. 
DESCRIPTION OF WORK
Contractor services for the XML Documentation and On-line help Pilot will fall into five categories:  
Document Reengineering
Assist GESB personnel in analyzing and re-engineering one or two existing publications for non-serialized authoring and XML production. The analysis and reengineering process will include the identification of addressable document structures and the designation of an appropriate XML Unit of Work (UOW).  Revised authoring standards will be developed, as required.
XML Schema Development
Design, develop, and test XML document schemas for Document Topic and Publication Bill-of-Materials instance documents that support the non-serialized document standards defined during the document reengineering process.
XML Document Publishing Architecture (XDPA) implementation
Evaluate XML authoring tools including Microsoft Word 2003, Broadvision Quicksilver, and XMLspy Authentic. 
Design, develop, and test authoring tool based XML content check-in and check-out facility.
Design, develop, and test XSLT, XSL-FO, and CSS style sheets to support XML document content repurposing. Documentation deliverables will include: single topic HTML and PDF web site content, serialized publication PDF data, and web based help collection HTML formatted content.

<CONTACT>Terry Traino, (732) 532-2675
<DESC>Please contact Barbara Johns - email address:  barbara.johns@us.army.mil.  CECOM/ GUADRAIL weapon system teams plans to enter into an agreement for support of the GUARDRAIL Sub-systems RRS and ICS.  This contract will be a 5 year Indefinite Delivery,  Indefinite Quantity contract that will be for acquisition of spare parts, repair of failed units and for technical support.  We are aware of problems of obsolescence and require the contractor to provide solutions to enable sustainment of this equipment. Background on the RRS, AN/ARW-85V(2). The RRS is the interface between the CTT RF link and the IDL that replaces ICTT. This unit is comprised of a Signal Data Translator, a digitally controlled Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radio receiver and transmitter, and  rack/harness assembly. The function of the RRS is to receive the uplink data for retransmission on UHF and receive UHF data for downlink to the Ground Processing Facilities (GPF). The RRS is the interface between the CTT Radio Frequency (RF) link and te I nteroperable Data Link (IDL) to provide support for multiple relay capability.  The RRS also provides the capability to reduce the level of transmissions at the input of the Prime Mission Equipment (PME).  The RRS acts to extend the operational range betwe en the Integrated Processing Facility (IPF) and the field terminals of the CTT system.  All data handled by the relay is encrypted.  The relay has no ability to encrypt/decrypt data but serves simply as a conduit for data from terminal to terminal.  The RR S uses the higher altitude of the sensor platform to extend/increase the Line of Sight (LOS) communication range between the CTT field terminals and the CTT terminal in the IPF.  The frequency agile RRS is a standard configuration for later GR/CS aircraft.   The RRS is mounted in the RC-12K GR/CS aircraft.  The RRS is installed in dedicated spaces in the Airborne Relay Facility (ARF) racks of the RC-12K using a rack harness assembly.  Raytheon was the prime manufacturer. Background on the Interference Cancel lation System (ICS). The ICS prevents aircraft transmitters from degrading the performance of intercept and DF receivers.  As a part of the ARF modification, ICS is designed to provide a reduction in the received signal strength from a collocated transmitt er using a cancellation technique that subtracts a sampling of the transmitter power from the received signal. It uses a control system that adjusts the gain and phase of the sampled transmitted power to improve cancellation. It provides the capability to cancel multiple transmitters from multiple receivers.  The American Nucleonics Corporation, Westlake Village, CA, was the prime manufacturer.  The part number is 107800/Module 107802. The cost for one ICS is $233K and production time is approximately 10 mo nths. The United States Government (USG) seeks to procure a Repair and/or replacement Contract for the Airborne Radio Relay System (RRS) AN/ARW-85V(2) and the ICS. (The (2) signifies the Army version.  The Air Force version is AN/ARW-85V(3) and we are only  interested in the Army version, AN/ARW-85V(2)).  The RRS/ICS is utilized with the Commanders Tactical Terminal (CTT) and Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT) radio systems.  RRS/ICS units are located in each GR/CS aircraft for all 4 GR/CS .  A total of approxima tely 40 units will be required for replacement, and/or sustainment.  The RRS/ICS equipment in its current configuration has an extensive list of obsolete parts.  Repair and/or replacement expertise is also lacking on this older RRS equipment.  The USG seek s a repair and/or replacement solution to solve these issues. This Request for Information is for a potential source to provide a Repair and/or replacement solution through redesign or replacement in the form of a white paper of the RRS/ICS unit.  No fundi ng will be provided for any responses to this inquiry.  The white paper shall include a discussion of how configuration control will be maintained across all re paired and/or replaced RRS/ICS units.  Configuration Control is essential to keep testing costs at a minimum.  Any change to the existing RRS/ICS will require testing to include but not be limited to Air Worthiness testing.  The intent of the Government is  to give widest distribution within the Government of the white paper.  If available, the white paper shall provide Corporate Information/History, Commercial Pricing Information, Availability, Delivery, Life Cycle Cost Reduction, and any other pertinent pr oduct and corporate information. All interested parties considering submission in support of this request for technical support should submit a white paper no greater than 10 pages in length and should include at a minimum the following information: 1) Pro vide evidence of the contractors facilities and experience with type of testing. 2) Provide evidence of past performance on similar projects in support of the requested work. 3) Respondents may offer white papers on a total support approach or on any subs et of this support requirement. This documentation may be mailed to US Army, Commander CECOM, AMSEL-LC-IEWS-R-GR, Building 1201W, Fort, Monmouth, NJ 07703-5211 to the attention of Barbara Johns.  Documentation may also be sent to electronic address barbara .johns@us.army.mil.

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole source contract to SystemWare, Inc. of Thousand Oaks, California, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source.  This procurement is for the purchase of the ScenarioFlex Portable Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) System.	This system will include the hardware and software that make up the system plus an extended warranty and maintenance agreement of three years.  The ScenarioFlex Portable TSCM System is a self contained computer using the vendor's proprietary hardware and software configured in such a way by the vendor that it can detect, analyze, identify, and discriminate among radio frequency signals and electrical impulses in a far more sophisticated manner than lesser such systems available to private industry.  This ScenarioFlex Portable TSCM System being purchased was developed by SystemWare, Inc. to meet standards set by the U. S. Army and the Department of Defense.  Those standards are considered in the counter surveillance community to be the highest and most sensitive available for use by U. S. Government agencies.  SystemWare is the sole supplier of the ScenarioFlex Portable TSCM System.    The ScenarioFlex Portable TSCM System also is an upgrade of this type of system usually found in private industry applications.  The private industry version would not be acceptable to NASA.  The upgraded application is available only to U. S. Government agencies, and it was developed to U. S. Army and Department of Defense specifications.  This is the highest level and most capable radio frequency and electronic signal detection, analysis and identification system available for counter surveillance inspection and detection work generally available to U. S. Government agencies.  The ScenarioFlex Portable TSCM System contains 17 hardware and software components, among which 10 are proprietary items that only SystemWare, Inc. can provide.  Any such counter surveillance inspection and detection equipment acquired needs to be the same as used by other Federal agencies, because NASA Security Specialists team with those other agencies to perform inspection and detection sweeps at different locations. All the different agency specialists involved in those sweeps have to be able to operate each other's equipment without difficulty or delay in order to conduct the sweeps effectively.  Familiarity with the equipment and its capabilities and characteristics is of paramount importance to the NASA Security Specialists and the Security Specialists of other Federal agencies who will be sharing each other's equipment.  The ScenerioFlex Portable TSCM System not only fulfills NASA's functional requirements, but, more importantly, it is the system being used by most of the other Federal agencies that Code NASA Security Specialists will be working with in shared services situations. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Any determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Spectra-Physics Inc. The notice of intent number being issued as NOI4114.  This Notice of intent document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business set-aside.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334510, which has a business size standard of 500.  The NIAID intends to procure Mai Tai BB-Laser.  The NIAID has been studying what cells in draining lymph nodes present antigens to primary CD8 + T-cells following infection with various viruses, whether exogenous or endogenous proteins are presented to primary ant-viral CD8 + T-cells and how these factors change with virus type and forms of antigen encoded by the virus.  Intravital microscopy is essential to obtain knowledge of the actual presentation events that occur in vivo.  To examine cells even as close as a couple hundred of microns beneath the surface of a lymph node, multi-photon microscopy is necessary.  The laser request is necessary for the upgrade of the Leica confocal microscope to multi-photon capability.  It provides an extremely wide tuning range of wavelengths with high average powers and extremely high stability.

The imaging will be used to document and evaluate baseline conditions of instream and riparian river habitats prior to the implementation of a new flow regime and certain instream restoration measures.  The imaging and analyses may be repeated in the future to evaluate change following implementation of those measures.  The Cheoah River is approximately 100 to 150 feet in width and riparian areas of interest would generally extend approximately 300 feet beyond the river channel on each side of the river.   The study area is located at an elevation of approximately 1,100 to 1,750 feet in mountainous terrain, and the Cheoah River is in a deeply incised valley.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends on entering into a sole source procurement with Georgia Tech Research Corporation, Office of Sponsored Programs, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA 30332 under the authority of FAR Subsection 13.106-1(b). In order to perform this work the contractor must meet the following requirements:  The Contractor must have a Ph. D. in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in information technology and knowledge based methods; The Contractor must be familiar with the AP210 standard with practical experience with its use in: thermal analysis, design optimization, and component bonding analysis in electronic packaging; Advanced collaborative engineering environments; PCB stackup design; PCB warpage analysis; and Printed Wiring Board (PWB) Warpage Analysis Framework (PWAF).  Additionally, the contractor must have worked on at least three separate AP210 based projects and have published at least one article on board warpage using the AP210 standard; have knowledge of constrained objects (COBs), multi representational architectures (MRA) for CAD CAE interoperability, Manufactory Product Models (MPM), Analytical Product Models (APM), Solution Method Models (SMM), and contaxt based analysis models (CBAM); and must be familiar with the Principles of Shadow Moire for analysis of board warpage. The purpose of this work is to develop a set of software tools that help measure and predict printed circuit board warpage due to temperature differences and make use of the international standard 10303 Industrial Automation Systems and Integration – Product Data Representation and Exchange (STEP) on Electrical Assembly Interconnect and Packaging Design (STEP-AP210) to store the board warpage information in a standard format. This is a continuation of work completed in a previous order; the required work is to update and extend the software board prototype initiated in the previous order, while maintaining the overall capabilities which must continue to be supported in the updated application version. It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order will be awarded with an option period.  The option would be to continue to study the effect of board warpage based on thermal factors and added components. Any interested party may submit, in writing, a detailed capability statement to respond to this requirement.  However, a determination by the Government to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U. S. Army Tank-automotive and Armament Command-Picatinny, New Jersey, has a requirement for augmentation of Picatinny’s in-house boiler operating crew in  monitoring boiler and water treatment operations on temporary boilers that are  currently being rented from Premier Energy Services, Inc., Woodstock Georgia,  under Purchase Order No. DAAE30-03-M-0284.  An oral solicitation will be issued  on a sole-source basis to Premier Energy Services, Inc., under FAR 6.302-1,  using simplified acquisition procedures.  Because they own the boilers,  designed the layout for the installation of the boilers, and installed the  boilers and all associated utility appurtenances, Premier has a unique  capability to perform the required services and no other source can satisfy the  Government’s requirements. Under the current order, the Government is  responsible for operation and maintenance of the rental boilers.  Procurement  of the required services from Premier during the upcoming Fall 2004 - Winter  2005 heating season will significantly reduce the risk to the Government for  the cost of repairs that are attributable to the Government’s operation and  maintenance of the boilers.  A separate purchase order is being contemplated  because a modification to include the required services under the current order  would exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  The period of performance  is planned to be a total of 10 months, which may include one or more options.  Award is anticipated in early September 2004.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis to Intelligent Automation Corporation, San Diego, CA, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  This action is being pursued on a sole-source ba sis because the Government believes that Intelligent Automation Corporation is the only contractor with the intimate knowledge of the operation of the Biomonitor Expert (BME) program and U.S. Army Center for Environmental Health Research (USACEHR) biomonit or, and since the biomonitor has not yet been sold directly as a commercial product, Intelligent Automation Corporation is truly in a unique position to provide the required biomonitor operations support.  Biomonitor hardware maintenance and Biomonitor Exp ert (BME) software support is required for two aquatic biomonitor field operations at Fort Detrick and Old O-Field (Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD).  Duties at both facilities include:  maintenance (filter flushing/cleaning, aquaculture maintenance, water qua lity probe maintenance and calibration), fish change-outs, bi-weekly report generation with graphic representation and interpretation, consultation concerning unusual events with USACEHR and on-site personnel, remote data monitoring and analysis and on-sit e evaluation, and coordination of toxicity verification and follow-on sample analysis.  Fish (bluegills) must be collected or purchased, acclimated to site conditions, and replaced as necessary.  Also required is testing support for follow-on to field oper ation contamination incidents or unanticipated biomonitor operational problems.  Typical biomonitoring testing includes disassembly, cleaning, and reassembly of the biomonitor system, test initiation, chemical preparation and delivery set-up, initial monit oring, test maintenance, water chemistry measurements, test observations, and diluter system operation, test termination, data archiving and analysis.  USAMRAA intends to award this requirement under Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The performance peri od is for 20 hours a week for a period of one year beginning approximately 1 October 2004.  Interested respondents who feel that they are capable of meeting these requiements may identify their interest by submitting technical documentation and resumes dem onstrating capability to Dana Herndon at facsimile number 301-619-3002 by 8 September 2004.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No telephone requests will be accepted.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 with the Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum (APIAHF), San Francisco, CA, to further develop the Asian American Health Website.  The period of performance is one (1) year with one one-year option period. 

In 2003, NLM launched the Asian American Health Website (http://asianamericanhealth.nlm.nih.gov/) in order to increase knowledge about Asian Americans and their health status by providing current, accurate and culturally-appropriate health research and clinical information for and about Asian Americans.   The information on the website is targeted to health consumers, providers and researchers.

NLM plans to collaborate with APIAHF to further develop, expand the content and promote the use of the website.  Specifically, APIAHF shall:

1.	Establish a users board composed of professionals in research, data collection, health care, public health, and member of community-based organizations, schools, institutions that will work with APIAHF to act as an advisory body to provide guidance on the development of NLM’s Asian American Health Website and to develop and promote the website.

2.	Analyze, assess and provide recommendations for the expansion and enhancement of NLM’s Asian American Health Website with regard to content and usability.

3.	Develop protocols and an implementation plan for the improvement and maintenance of the NLM Asian American Health Website.

APIAHF is uniquely qualified to provide these services.  APIAHF is a national organization dedicated to promoting policy, program and research efforts for the improvement of health status of all Asian American and Pacific Islander communities.  The mission of the APIAHF works closely with other Asian American and Pacific Islander organizations and the Asian American community in general.  This is a unique organization for NLM to work with in this health information development and dissemination project because they are the only organization devoted to broadly working on health promotion and improvement of the Asian American community at both the national and community level.  They are unique in having the technical expertise to work with electronic health information resources and also the community involvement necessary to this project.  APIAHF has the knowledge to identify the appropriate organizations and communities with which to work as well as the credibility needed to negotiate for the use of the NLM we site of health information resources not currently in digital format.  In addition, the promotion of the use of this web site within the Asian American community is a critical part of this project and APIAHF is well situated to accomplish that task. 

This service will be solicited using FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions).  

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all interested parties may submit a capabilities statement which will be considered by the NLM.  The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  All capabilities statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria:

1.  Past Performance:  The contractor shall provide past performance information that demonstrates knowledge and experience in the following: experience working with other Asian American Health organizations, including those representing health professionals as well as consumers; experience working with Asian American community-based organizations throughout the United States; experience in dealing with Asian Americans and their health issues; ability to create a users group representing the stakeholders appropriate to the NLM Asian American Health web site; understanding of the target population and their need for health information.

2.  Corporate Capability: The contractor shall demonstrate the following: experience with health information dissemination in the Asian American community; experience with the development of appropriate health-related materials (information and information resources) for the Asian American community; an understanding of or experience with the selection, organization, and/or provision of health information, including the issues surrounding quality of such information on the web.

<DESC>Industry Day, Greenville, South Carolina, Architect-Engineering/Design Services for the New United States District Courthouse

On Monday August 30, 2004, The United States General Services Administration (GSA), will conduct an Industry Day for Small Business Architect/Engineer firms, which may be interested, in participating in the design phase of the new United States Courthouse in Greenville, South Carolina.  Industry Day will be conducted from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. at the C.F. Haynesworth Federal Building in Greenville South Carolina. Please arrive early to allow time to go through security.  Picture IDs will be required.  Cell phones, laptops or any other electronic equipment will not be allowed in the Federal Building.

The facility to be designed and constructed will consist of 21 158 gross square meters (gsm)  227,747 gross square feet (gsf) without parking, and approximately 23 908 gsm  257,347 gsf including 74 interior parking spaces.  The proposed courthouse will provide a total of eight (8) courtrooms: - six (6) district, and two (2) magistrate courtrooms.  The building will house the Circuit, District, and Magistrate Courts; U. S. Attorney; U. S. Marshals Service; U. S. Probation; U. S. Pretrial Service; Public Defenders; and GSA.  The courthouse will be located within the Central Business District, of Greenville, South Carolina.

The Estimated Total Project Cost (ETPC) is between $45,000,000 and $55,000,000.

Industry Day is intended to affirm GSA’s recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between that community and the short-listed design firms that has been selected for this project. 

Prospective Small Business will be given an opportunity to network with the short-listed design firms and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified consultants/subcontractors.  Although it is anticipated that this Industry Day will assist the short-listed design firms in identifying qualified consultants/subcontractors to meet the subcontracting goals established for this project, because GSA is not permitted by law to be a party to contractual relationships between potential Lead Designer and Consultants/Subcontractors, any contracts that may develop as a result of Industry Day will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.

Questions about the Greenville Industry Day should be directed to either David Gibson, GSA’s Small Business Outreach Specialist, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail davida. gibson@gsa.gov; or Dinora Gonzalez GSA's Small Business Technical Advisor, Telephone (404) 331-5103, E-Mail dinora gonzalez@gsa.gov.

<DESC>C-Architect-Engineer Services Solicitation # GS-04P-EXC-0032 – Greenville, South Carolina, GSA contracting officer phone number - 404-331-4616.
Continuing a centuries-old legacy of extraordinary public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects to design Federal buildings of outstanding quality and value, buildings that provide superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees as well as give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.  In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for a New U. S. Federal Courthouse to be constructed in Greenville, South Carolina in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  The building is approximately 21 158 gross square meters (gsm)  227,747 gross square feet (gsf) without parking, and approximately 23 908 gsm  257,347 gsf including 74 interior parking spaces.  The proposed courthouse will provide a total of eight (8) courtrooms: - six (6) district, and two (2) magistrate courtrooms.  The building will house the Circuit, District, and Magistrate Courts; U. S. Attorney; U. S. Marshals Service; U. S. Probation; U. S. Pretrial Service; Public Defenders; and GSA.  The proposed facility will be constructed in Greenville, SC with the exact site still to be determined.  The Estimated Construction Cost range is approximately $45 million to $55 million 
The facility will be designed in metric units.  The scope of work will require at a minimum:  metric construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, value engineering services, life cycle costing, space planning, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and construction phase services (option to be exercised at a later date) for a facility that includes the construction of a new building and related systems, inside parking, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features.  The facility must be designed to meet the energy goal established by GSA.  The building is also to include the GSA design standards for secure facilities; Facilities Standard for the Public Buildings Services; the Courts Design Guide requirements; the U. S. Marshal’s design requirements, the U. S. Attorney’s Office design requirements and any other agency specific guidelines as part of the design. The design of the facility shall include sustainable design and construction practices following the LEED format and will incorporate total building commissioning as defined by GSA design guides.  GSA will contract separately during the design phase for construction management (CM) and/or Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services.  The CM/CMc will be involved in the design process to provide:  construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and functionality and constructability reviews.  The CMc may continue with construction by separately procuring subcontracts for construction.  There will be a formal partnering process throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution through voluntary commitments to accomplish established agreed-upon project objectives by all involved parties to their mutual benefit.
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or the team of designers who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept and the project design.

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for a New U. S.

The proposed courthouse will provide a total of eight (8) courtrooms: - six (6) district, and two (2) magistrate courtrooms.  The building will house the Circuit, District, and Magistrate Courts; U. S. Attorney; U. S. Marshals Service; U. S. Probation; U. S. Pretrial Service; Public Defenders; and GSA.  The proposed facility will be constructed in Greenville, SC with the exact site still to be determined.  The Estimated Construction Cost range is approximately $45 million to $55 million

<DESC>Sverdrup Technology, Inc. (Sverdrup) intends to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for manufacturing engineering and process development support in accordance with the following requirements: The objective of this effort is to provide manufacturing expertise to the Sverdrup/MSFC Engineering community through manufacturing engineering consultations and manufacturing process development support.  Manufacturing engineering consultations may consist of an exchange of information via telephone, email, fax, engineering design drawing review, or other forms of communication. Manufacturing process development support will result from some of the manufacturing engineering consultations.  It will primarily consist of manufacturing complex design, tight-tolerance research and development (R&D) type hardware.  The hardware that is manufactured will be for proof of manufacturability only and will not be used for ground tests or flight. The vendor will provide a systematic approach to the integrated concurrent design of products and their related processes, including manufacturing and support.  Identify the needs from customer requirements and provide an understanding of solutions.  Improve successful development of products. The vendor will provide manufacturing engineering expertise and collaboration supporting Sverdrup/NASA to effectively design, develop, and produce new products and processes in the manufacture of aerospace components. The vendor will provide a continuous forum for collaboration and sharing of ideas among the Sverdrup/NASA engineering workforce throughout all disciplines involved in product development associated with transition from concept and customer requirements to a best product design that is producible by efficient and optimized processes. The vendor will provide communication to better define the product and better document the design process.  Address the execution of advanced manufacturing processes to accurately and effectively produce products according to the customer requirements. The vendor shall be ISO 9001 certified. The vendor shall be listed on the MSFC Audited Vendor List. The vendor must have experience collaborating with NASA on the design and manufacturability of mission critical flight hardware for the Space Shuttle Main Engine program including the low pressure oxidizer turbopump stator assembly, the high pressure fuel turbopump impeller, and main fuel pump housing for the high pressure advanced turbopump.

<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) spends approximately $100 billion in services annually.  DoD has embarked upon a spend analysis for various types of services to determine how much is being spent, to implement strategic sourcing approaches, and to ultimately develop a sound commodity strategy resulting in cost savings and improvement of services provided.  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit information on clerical and office support functions (collectively referred to as "clerical services"), which is the pilot effort under the DoD-Wide Strategic Sourcing (DWSS) program.  DWSS GOALS: DoD is seeking information to assist us in attaining a solution that supports the following goals: * Department-wide cross-functional acquisition strategies; *Reduction in Total Cost of Ownership for acquired services/products; * Improvements in meeting socio-economic goals through the use of strategic sourcing. * Leverage commercial best practices in order to streamline and standardize DoD acquisition business processes. Initial spend analysis and market research of clerical services reflects substantial participation by small businesses. Research also reflects a wide variance in the markups (the price difference between the wage rate paid to the administrative personnel and the contract price) between the largest marketplace providers of clerical services and other vendors.  The objective of this RFI is to identify the cost drivers that impact markup rates for clerical services.  We are particularly interested in identifying process improvements or requirements changes that could be made by DoD in it's acquisition of clerical services that would result in significant reductions in markup rates.    RESPONSES TO THE RFI: The following sections provide a suggested format for a response to the RFI.     This format is intended to minimize your effort and structure the responses for ease of analysis.     Please do not provide proprietary information in response to this RFI.  - Acquisition Approach: Provide ideas and suggestions for DoD acquisition approaches for procuring clerical services more efficiently and cost effectively.     Include the following information: Section 1 - Government Business Practices: Provide a list of government business practices that impact your ability to provide cost-effective business solutions to the Government's clerical services requirements.     Provide suggestions for improvements to these practices and an estimate of potential savings (as a percentage of total cost) if these practices were changed Section 2 - Markups: Please provide a response to the following questions (NOTE: an electronic spreadsheet version is available from the POC below) rating your responses on a scale from 1 (no cost impact) to 10 (high cost impact) on your markup rate:  (1) Increased Purchase Volume (more clerical support employees) (2) Increased Assignment Duration per Clerical Support Worker (3) Improvements/ Greater Accuracy in Customers' Skill Set Specification (4) Simpler / More Streamlined Proposal & Bidding Process (5) More Efficient Contract Management Process (e.g. processes related to changing wage rates, creating modifications, ...) (6)  Improved ordering process (e.g. On-Line Order vs. Manual (phone, Fax, email, in-person), centralized vs decentralized, ...) (7) Improved Invoicing Process (e.g. centralized vs decentralized, ...) (8) Other - list other factors  related to how we do business that have an impact on your markup costs.   Section 3 - Pricing Estimate:  Please provide your fully burdened hourly labor rate excluding profit for the following  locations and Service Contract Act labor categories.   For estimating purposes please assume the following  potential yearly need .  Washington DC area, General Clerk III (100,000 man hours), Secretary II (80,000 man hours)and Accounting Clerk II (60,000 man hours).  Assume that all require a Confidential Security Clearance.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS, WITH THE PURPOSE OF GAINING KNOWLEDGE OF POTENTIAL QUALIFIED SOURCES RELATIVE TO NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE 561210, SIZE STANDARD: $30M. RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS WILL BE USED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION DECISIONS.  REQUIREMENT NASA-Ames Research Center (ARC)has a requirement to procure support services for the following functional areas:  .       Industrial Hygiene  ·   Health Physics .	    Occupational Safety ·    Construction Safety Engineering ·	   Fire Protection Engineering ·   Voluntary Protection Program ·  Injury/Illness Data Analysis ·  Emergency Response Program ·    Training (Safety, Health, Medical, Emergency Response) ·	     Computer Support/Management Services .       Health Unit Operations  ·  Fitness Center Operations ·	Employee Assistance Program The contractor will be required to provide services in all of the disciplines listed above.	A complete description of the aforementioned functional areas is available in the draft Statement of Requirements (SOR), under the NASA-Ames Research Center web Site. BACKGROUND From 1993 through 1999, the stated requirement, which had also included Environmental Services, was divided between two separate contracts: 1) Medical Services was awarded under a CPFF/LOE type contract; and, 2) Occupational Safety, Industrial Hygiene and Environmental, was awarded CPAF.  The decision to award the follow-on requirement to one contractor was believed to be a more cost effective approach to managing the programs.   As a result, the procurement was competed, and a CPAF contract was awarded March 2, 2000 to PAI, Inc., a small, woman-owned, disadvantaged business.  The period of performance included a three-year base period and one two-year option. The estimated cost is $38Mil. Completion is scheduled for March 2005.  Due to internal restructuring, transition of resources and budget constraints, ARC believes that dividing the requirements once again under two separate contracts for the next follow-on effort, is the best approach to managing the resources in today's economy, while opening the procurement to a broader range of competitive sources.  Environmental Services will be posted under a separate sources sought announcement.  ARC contemplates awarding a performance-based Cost-Plus-Award-Fee Contract for five (5) years; a two-year basic period, a two-year option period, following by a one-year option period. Requirements will be requested on Contract Task Orders (CTOs) issued under the basic contract. Offerors having the specialized qualifications and capabilities outlined in the SOR, should submit a capability statement in 5 pages or less, to Sharon Carlino, Contract Specialist, Mail Stop 241-1, Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000 no later than 6:00PM EST, January 14, 2004.  Reference RFP2-38287 on all correspondence.   Qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement under Full and Open Competition Procedures.    Responses should contain the following information:  1) Company name, address, point of contact, phone, fax, e-mail, and website (if applicable)  2) Size of business, i.e. large, small, small disadvantaged, HUB Zone, 8(a), or woman-owned for NAICs code 561210, size standard $30M; number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); 3) Company capabilities in all functional areas as they relate to the attached SOR. In responding to this element, please create a table, as described below:	   a) List the following functions: Industrial Hygiene, Health Physics, Occupational Safety, Construction Safety Engineering, Fire Protection Engineering, Voluntary Protection Program, Injury/Illness Data Analysis, Emergency Response Program, Training, Computer Support, Medical Services, Fitness Center Operations, Employee Assistance Program.      b) In the adjacent column, state the number of years experience your company has in each functional area. 4) Relevant work performed in the past five (5) years.  Include contract number and type, technical description, dollar amount, period of performance, customer references, name and phone number. Also include relevant work in collaboration with the Occupational Health and Safety community and work that facilitates working partnerships within the industry.  5) Please comment on any aspects of the SOR, particularly as they relate to the performance-based approach to managing the requirements. All questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail or fax). Telephone calls will not be accepted.  No solicitation exists. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   Failure to respond to this synopsis does not mean that a firm cannot respond to a solicitation at a later date.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

Normally the responsibility of, and performed by, designated maintenance activities for direct support of using organizations.  It normally consists of calibrating, repairing, or replacing damaged or unserviceable parts, components, or assemblies; modification of material, emergency manufacturing of unavailable parts; and providing technical assistance to using organizations.  Intermediate level maintenance is normally accomplished by the using command in fixed or mobile shops, or by the dispatch of specialists from the shops to the using organization.  Intermediate level maintenance is sometimes indistinguishable from organizational level maintenance and, at times, there is no need to draw any distinction between these two.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, is seeking qualified sources that can provide improved, digitally operated 2.75-Inch Rocket launchers for use by U.S. Navy, Marine Corps and Army attack and special operations aircraft. The launchers will support all interface requirements of the current 2.75-inch guided and unguided family of rockets, and will replace the Navy’s LAU 61/68 rocket launchers and the Army’s M260 and M261 rocket launchers.  Interface requirements for the launchers include compliance with the MIL-STD-1760D Aircraft/Store Electrical Interconnection System (as a carriage store without a Carriage Store Station Interface), the two 23 and 26 pin connectors of the Rocket Management System (RMS), and a backward-compatible 5-pin analog interface through which 28 VDC firing pulses are sent to the launcher to fire rockets in a sequential order.  These launchers must be compatible with current 14-inch weapon suspension and release systems, have compatibility with current and future 2.75-inch rocket types (guided and unguided), and must provide the ability to set current Remote Settable Fuzed Rockets.  The launcher will include a safety switch that disables all firing circuit functions.  The launchers must be capable of upgrades to complement future guided rocket product improvements that may use MILSTD1553 or other digital communications from the launcher to the warhead/guidance systems.  The launchers must comply with the functional, physical, electrical, and messaging interfaces defined in the interface control document (ICD) that is available upon request.  The launchers must provide the launch platform with launcher built-in-test capability/status, individual tube functional status/rocket inventory, and the ability to fire rockets in individually selected tubes. The launcher will support uploading of software revisions to the launcher electronic assembly (LEA) through its MILSTD1760 connector. The launchers must be capable of detecting whether rockets are being ripple or single fired as well as keeping track of the total number of rockets fired over the life of the launcher.  The launcher must be loadable with rocket inventory data using currently available support equipment, as well as directly from the cockpit.   The rocket inventory must be capable of being uploaded to platforms from the launcher.  Electronic systems interfaces must be compatible with CMBRE test equipment. The U.S. Navy/Marine Corps has available an LEA for integration into the launcher that meets the ICD requirements.  The size, weight, and physical configuration of this LEA are available upon request.  

The launchers must be capable of 430 hours of aircraft carriage, with any number of tubes loaded. Each launcher must survive a minimum of 25 firings per tube (50 firings per tube desired) and survive 10 ripple firings.  The launchers must be capable of surviving off-aircraft handling and storage with any number of tubes loaded.  The launchers will provide increased mean-time-between-failure over existing 2.75 rocket launchers.  It is desired that the launchers be repairable at the Army Aviation Intermediate Maintenance (AVIM) level. The launchers must improve the Insensitive Munitions performance of the rocket/launcher system, to include improved bullet and fragment impact and fast and slow cook-off protection. It is necessary to be able to harmonize the launcher’s aimpoint with the launch platform boresight.  The launchers must be tube loadable when mounted on aircraft.   The launchers must provide a significant weight reduction below currently deployed U.S. Navy/Marine Corps launchers on a per tube basis.  Current U.S. Navy/Marine Corp launchers contain 7 or 19 launch tubes and weigh 84 lbs and 155 lbs respectively.  Launcher weights less than the U.S. Army 2.75-inch 7 and 19 tube Rocket Launchers, which weigh  35 lbs and 85 lbs respectively, are desirable.  The launchers are not restricted to 7 and 19 tubes, but should provide a similar large/small load capability.  The launchers must be capable of operation on AH-1W/Z, UH-1N/Y, and H-60 Series Navy/Marine Corps rotary wing aircraft, and the AH-64A, AH-64D, OH-58D, MH-60 Direct Action Penetrator (DAP) and AH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB).   It is desired that the launcher be capable of operation on F/A-18C/D/E/F, AV-8B, and JSF fixed wing aircraft.  Operation on unmanned air vehicles such as the Fire Scout and the Predator is also desired.  A growth capability will be provided for carriage of a variant of the launcher on M299 HELLFIRE missile launch rails, and will provide for interface through the HELLFIRE Missile shotgun connector using a signal set similar to that specified in MIL-STD 1760A.

  
All parties that currently have or will have the capability to provide the above-described launcher should submit the following information: technical material pertaining to your company's current or future capability to supply the specified launcher, past sales and performance information for both Government and Commercial sales; and any other additional information that could be useful in determining your company's ability to meet the requirements.

<DESC>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), helps to ensure an end to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, supporting the development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and supporting the development of vaccines and other prevention strategies.  The purpose of this planned acquisition is to seek a contractor to continue an ongoing quality assessment program for virologic assays performed on samples from subjects enrolled in DAIDS-sponsored multi-site clinical studies.  The Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) Program is critical to the scientific integrity of on-going and future studies concerning HIV diagnosis, disease progression, assessment of treatment, vaccine efficacy and other preventive measures.  The VQA has been in operation since 1988 and has developed and standardized quality control procedures for approximately 25 virologic assays used in DAIDS-sponsored clinical trials.  DAIDS is seeking capability statements from organizations capable of performing the following tasks:  (1) implement standards of performance for existing and newly developed virologic assays and assess the ability of Sites to successfully perform the assays; (2) conduct studies on the adaptation, standardization and application of new and existing virologic and biostatistic methodologies; (3) acquire, characterize, store, document and disburse quality control materials and reagents to include biohazardous materials and infectious agents; (4) disseminate Virology Quality Assessment technical and scientific data; (5) maintain computerized software systems that support the VQA Program; and (6) expand services to include additional Sites when necessary through exercise of Options.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITIES RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS AN 8(a) SET-ASIDE; 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE OR AS FULL AND OPEN. ALL SIZE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES. To ensure the validity and inter- and intra-laboratory comparability of virologic laboratory data obtained from DAIDS-supported clinical trials and HIV natural history studies, the contractor will continue a program for "Real-Time Assay Validation," where known quality control materials (QCMs) are tested by VQA-supported laboratories (Sites) in parallel with patient samples to ensure the validity of each assay “run.”  The contractor will also conduct a "Proficiency Testing" (PT) program, where unknown QCMs are tested by the Sites to periodically monitor Site assay performance.  The contractor will provide participating Sites with standardized reagents and controls for conducting research aimed at development and evaluation of virologic and statistical methodologies.  The VQA Program will serve current and future DAIDS-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups (User Groups).  Currently supported User Groups include: the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG), the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG), the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS), the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), the Community Program for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA), the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), the Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS (CIPRA), the Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP), as well as other domestic and international individual grantees.  Collaborations are anticipated with CDC Global AIDS Program (GAP)-affiliated laboratories supporting the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) activities.  Currently, the VQA program serves approximately 55 domestic and 25 international Sites.  The base contract is expected to cover these 80 Sites.  Although the structure of the clinical trial networks is subject to change during the contract period, the changes are not expected to result in changes to the number of participating Sites in the base contract.  However, the Government anticipates a need to expand the number of Sites during the course of the contract, and such an increase in the contractor’s activities may be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as one or more Options in each of the contract years.  The work to be performed under this contract is currently being carried out by Rush Presbyterian – St. Luke’s Medical, under contract N01-AI-85354 and is expected to be completed on September 20, 2005.  All capability statements will be evaluated against related ability and experience for providing this type and magnitude of support; available qualified personnel; corporate experience and existing facilities and resources. It is anticipated that this contract will be for a 7-year period of performance and require an estimated 9 to 19 FTEs with expertise consistent with the operations of a project of this size and complexity. All interested organizations should submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above. Please respond as directed by Government-Wide Numbered Note 25 which states: “Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications: (1) Experience: An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed and any in-house research and development effort; (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientist, engineers and technical personnel who may be assigned as a principal investigator and/or project officer; (3) Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration.

<DESC>The Northern Region Contracting Center  Leavenworth, Fort Leavenworth, KS, is seeking sources among GSA schedule contractors.  The services required are for configuration management, testing, analysis and further software development and modificatio ns to the Aggregate-Level Communications Environment Server (ALCES).  The current contractor, Atlantic Consulting Services, developed the initial ALCES interface for Advanced Warfighting Simulation (AWARS).   The following tasks are required:  inclusion of  Opposing Force (OPFOR) Communications Effect that will allow ALCES to run in either Red or Blue mode, with Red ALCES modeling OPFOR entities and messages while Blue ALCES models friendly entities and messages with both using existing modeled communica tions systems (i.e. Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Small Unit Operations (SUO), Wireless Local Area Network (LAN), and Satellite Communications (SATCOM)).  Red and Blue ALCES will run concurrently but will be independent of each other.  Specific tasks  include:   Modify ALCES Federation Object Model (FOM) to define regions associated with Red and Blue traffic; modify ALCES to run in either Red or Blue mode, using the appropriate regions when publishing and subscribing, and when sending interaction s; modify ALCES test driver to send attribute updates and interactions in both Red and Blue regions; develop test cases with combination of Red and Blue traffic; run test cases to confirm that the Red ALCES handles Red traffic only and the Blue ALCES handl es Blue traffic only; complete the modification of ALCES to treat certain nodes as advantaged nodes based on relevant factors such as their geographic location with respect to terrain features and other nodes.  These advantaged nodes would receive differen t treatment in the ALCES routing and clustering algorithms so as to optimize the ability of the advantaged nodes to contribute to overall network effectiveness; complete the modification of ALCES to represent region-based network organization for JTRS Clus ter 1 WNW.  Region-based networking is projected for use in the Future Combat Systems (FCS) communications architecture.  Regions are used to determine network self-organization and may be assigned based on geography, echelon, or other factors.  This invol ves the development of algorithms and methods for incorporating a region-based network organization into the communications methodology.  This includes the capability to model various subnet topologies as well as the explicit modeling of stub nets; incorpo rate a current force communications system:  FM Radio, Design, Integration and Testing Plans.  Develop a design, integration, and testing plan for incorporating a standard non-digital FM Radio system model into ALCES, e.g. Receiver-Transmitter (RT) 1539. Provide for the ability to read in and utilize government furnished performance curves; provide on-site integration support at Fort Leavenworth for ALCES through completion of Phase I; Aggregate-Level Communications Environment Server (ALCES) software, to include performance curves for implemented Current Force Communications Systems models; ALCES documentation.  Additional optional tasks may be required.  The FSC for this project is B599, NAICS code is 541690.  If no responsive, responsible replies are rec eived, an order will be negotiated with Atlantic Consulting Services under their GSA contract for these services.  All responses will be considered and must include proof of ability to provide development/enhancement of ALCES software as well as past perfo rmance information.  Responses should also provide GSA schedule labor categories that would be proposed for these services and hourly rates.  All responses must include company name, address, POC, phone number, fax number, email address, business size, tax payer identification number, DUNS number and CAGE code.  All contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.gov/.  ALL RESPONSES MUST BE RECEIVED NOT LATER THAN 11:00 AM CDT ON 31 AUG 04.

<SUBJECT>D -- Agent Based Economic Modeling
<DESC>Agent Based Economic Modeling

Technology Partnership Opportunity

Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico, is developing an agent based microsimulation tool that models the dynamic interdependencies between infrastructures and the economy.  The agents are small pieces of computer code that model households, manufacturing firms, industries, commodities, material inputs, transportation, banking, and similar components of  an economy.  All the agents can be customized to a particular economic problem and geospatially plotted.

The unique capability of an agent microsimulation of a user-defined economy has high commercial potential. The generic design of the tool allows the user to quickly customize a problem, study dynamic behavior, and subsequently model corrective action. The architecture has been designed with this flexibility.

Sandia is making the agent microsimulation tool available to companies interested in partnering with Sandia to further develop the technology to the next release version via cooperative research and development agreements.  For further information, please respond by mail or fax to Colleen Kearney by September 7, 2004 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0762, PO Box 5800, Albuquerque, NM 87185-0762. Fax:   505-844-8011.  Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice and the type of partnering agreement your company would be most interested in entering into.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Physical Property Management System
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology’ s (NIST) Electromagnetic’s Division has a requirement for a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) which shall includes a super-conducting magnet with 9 T capability.  This unique system is for research on low field, low noise magnetic sensors.  NIST will rely on this equipment to aid in development of metrologies and nanostructured material to increase the signal to noise in room temperature magnetic thin film field sensors.  These devices will be incorporated into systems for biomedical, nondestructive failure analysis, data storage, Homeland Security, and other magnetic field measurement and mapping applications.  
Quantum Design has extensive experience producing and refining the physical property measurement systems (PPMS) and at this time the only source for the equipment that will measure and map the ultra-low magnetic fields as off-the-shelf equipment.  
The QD PPMS-9 is a unique system that is not available from any other company. The system comes with a super-conducting magnet with 9 T capabilities. The most significant features are:
A) “Ultra-low field capability” This capability gives residual field of less than 10-5 T along the 4 cm bore. With the combination of the low field and 9T capabilities, we will be able to investigate both the magnetic properties of pinning layers and high field sensors, as well as noise in low field sensors.
B) “Horizontal Sample Rotator” is a feature that NIST does not have in a high field, high temperature magnetometer (up to 1000 K). This feature will be critical in measuring the electrical transport in magnetic field sensors as a function of the angle of the field. These measurements will be conducted with the “Resistivity option”.
C) Low rate of helium consumption in a standard dewar. 
D) Adjustable temperature control of standard system from 1.9 to 350 K. Upgradeable to 1000 K.
E) DC magnetization sensitivity range down to 2.5 x 10 –15 emu.
F) Field uniformity ±0.01% over 5.5 x 1 cm diameter cylindrical volume
G) Field resolution of 0.02 mT up to 1 T; 0.2 mT up to 9 T
H) Clear bore of 2.5 cm
I) The vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) option, will be used for critical mesurements for several reasons:
i) The system must have a magnetometer in order to have the low field option.
ii) The VSM is significantly faster than existing systems at NIST, thereby allowing NIST to save factors of 2 in helium consumption while making extensive temperature and field dependent measurements.
iii) The VSM is the only magnetometer upgradeable to 1000 K, which at this time is not available in any other magnetometer at NIST with 9 T capability. It will also ramp to temperature in very short times (order of 2 minutes).
iv) The VSM is upgradeable to measurements of transverse moment in vertical field. This will enhance NIST's capabilities by allowing measurements of rotations of magnetization (spin spring) effects.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Electromagnetic’s Division intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Quantum Design for the above requirement, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. There is no solicitation available.

<CONTACT>Debra McLean, 508-233-4188
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.      The United States Army has a need for a new communications headset to integrate with the new Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH). The communications components, requested in this announcement, shall provide a communications headset system that allows the Soldi er dual or single channel radio communications in both high and low noise environments alone with hearing protection.  Items sought must be commercial items, and if applicable, available on GSA schedule.    The communication components will be used throughout the spectrum of U. S. Army operational continuum, from humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping, to counter-terrorism and counterinsurgency, to low intensity conflict and full-scale war.  The headset wi ll consist of modular communications components that can be integrated into the ACH helmet system or worn independently, as a stand-alone communications system. The communications components are desired to offer two independent capabilities: 1) a low noise  environment (no hearing protection) headset, 2) a high noise environment (with hearing protection) headset, or a single modular system that does both. The communications components will be required to operate with a variety of radio and intercommunication s systems (ICS). They must interface (to include connectors, and straight and coiled cabling of sufficient length for body worn equipment and intercoms) with the Joint Multi-band Inter/Intra Team Radio (MBITR PRC-148) and current authorized handheld and ve hicle mounted systems (PRC Family, SINGARS, Army Solider Intercom System (ICOM)) as well as vehicle platform intercom systems to include VIC-1, VIC-2 and VIC-3 intercoms.   The headset shall be binaural, allowing the user to simultaneously monitor two different radios, one for each ear.  The headset design may consist of two versions in order to meet the operational requirements for different noise environments.  The low nois e situations will require the user to communicate using radios and/or face-to-face communications, while listening to and understanding sounds from their local surroundings. The high noise situation will require hearing protection from high intensity conti nuous and impulse noise in addition to providing communications capability that is similar to that of the low noise situation.  The headset must also allow the user to hear ear safe sounds; both in high and low noise environments, utilizing an electronic t alk thru circuit. It is required that this circuit provides an amplification capability (roughly 15dB) of low level sounds normally out of the human range of hearing to a safe listening level.   If power is required for operation of the high noise headset,  then it must be contained within the headset unit or must be capable of pulling the power off the radio or vehicle intercom. The high noise headset also must be capable of attenuating steady state noise to a minimum of 94dBA from 125 to 8000 Hz for an exp osure time of 1-hour.  The high noise headset must be capable of attenuating steady state noise to a maximum of 88 dBA from 125 to 8000 Hz for a maximum exposure time of 4-8 hours.  The real ear attenuation must be tested IAW ANSI/ASA S12.6-1992. The thres hold sound test field shall be a noise spectrum of 110 dBA. The waterproof requirement for all communications components (i.e. microphone, earphones, connectors, cables, electrical switches, etc.) shall be corrosion proof and waterproof.  The requirement i s waterproof to a depth of 3 feet in salt water for thirty minutes.     Request product samples, photos, technical data or literature, and price breakouts for unit costs for above described systems and components be for warded to US Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, ATTN: George Schultheiss (D230) Kansas St, Natick, MA 01760-5019 no later than 10 Sep 04.  Information may also be forwarded electronically via email to:  george.schultheiss@natick.army.mil, please copy furn ish to: debra.mclean@natick.army.mil. Product samples submitted should be free of charge unless official order is placed for purchase.

Statement of Work:  I.  OBJECTIVE.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ensures the operational reliability and safety of each jurisdictional LNG import terminal and peak shaving facility through: a pre-authorization cryogenic design review; monthly progress reports and regular staff inspections during construction; semi-annual reports on plant operations; and annual and biennial staff inspections.  The FERC is seeking a very highly qualified contractor to perform the services described in Section II and submit to the FERC staff a report on its evaluation of the FERC’s LNG cryogenic design filing/review requirements and inspection program, and to make recommendations as necessary.

II.  SCOPE OF WORK.  The contractor shall work with the FERC staff to evaluate the cryogenic design review process and inspection program by which the FERC staff reviews proposed projects and ensures the continued operational reliability and safety of each jurisdictional LNG import terminal and peak shaving facility.  The contractor shall recommend to staff any additional measures which could be used to further enhance the safety inspection program, and ensure safe design, maintenance and operating practices.  The tasks to be performed include: 

•	An evaluation of the engineering and design information required of an applicant to file in its application under Title18, Code of Federal Regulations Part 380.12 in Resource Report 13; and the subsequent review criteria used by the staff to determine reliable and safe operations, and the adequacy of company operating and maintenance practices;
•	A review of the staff’s application of the design spill criteria used to establish thermal radiation and flammable vapor exclusion zones at LNG facilities;
•	An assessment of whether there are additional safety features or plant components that should be examined during inspections and/or application reviews;
•	An assessment of international construction, operation, and maintenance standards and/or regulations, e.g., in Japan or Europe, that offer better protection and/or operating and maintenance measures/standards.
•	An evaluation of the reports provided by LNG facility operators on a monthly basis during project construction and on a semi-annual basis during operations for the life of the facility, including the depth and types of information provided by the companies;

•	An evaluation of the Cryogenic Design and Inspection Manual prepared during the design review of proposed facilities and subsequently used to evaluate facility operation; including whether there are additional facets of plant operations, maintenance procedures, or procedures that should be examined.
•	An evaluation of the process used during inspections to evaluate plant operations, including the adequacy of the frequency of construction and operational inspections; to determine the adequacy of company operating and maintenance practices, to make decisions on the need for corrective action(s); and to follow up on recommendations.
•	Recommendations to improve the efficacy of each component of the elements evaluated above, including standards or criteria for making evaluations and recommendations.
•	A review of the LNG Program Manual, which documents the staff’s design review process, to determine that it accurately and completely documents the process and procedures used by the staff, and how to incorporate the recommendations of this study.

III.  DELIVERABLES.  Based upon the analyses, the contractor shall submit a comprehensive report to the FERC staff detailing the items in Section II and setting forth technical evaluations, recommendations, and conclusions regarding the LNG facility inspection program/process.  All requested topics shall be discussed in the report, which shall be considered confidential until released by the FERC.  The contractor shall also complete and provide to the FERC staff an electronic copy of the report in Microsoft Word 2002 format.  Deliverables shall include a contract kick-off meeting, monthly progress briefings, a draft report, a briefing of FERC staff on the draft report, an opportunity for staff comment on the draft report, and a final report.  The contractor will also be responsible for conducting weekly briefings by telephone with the FERC staff regarding the progress of the analysis.

IV.  SCHEDULE.  The contractor shall submit a schedule of deliverables including intermediate milestone dates.  The draft report shall be submitted to the FERC staff no later than 120 days after the award of the contract.  The report will be finalized with responses to FERC staff comments no later than 165 days after the award of the contract.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-04-314, and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-23.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 561990 and the business size standard is $6.0.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), has a requirement for ECG Interpretation.


Tasks to be performed:

Code backlog of unread EDGs using the Minnesota Code

Technical requirements:

1)	The ECG reading center shall read ECGs following the methods and criteria of the Minnesota Code, according to the rules in the Minnesota Code Manual of Electrocardiographic Findings.

2)	ECG Reading Procedures:

The NIH will provide electronic or paper copies of the ECGs to the reading center.  Earlier ECGs are only available on paper.  Contractor shall specify the type of electronic files they accept.

3)	Measurements:  The following measurements are required.  Specific methods for making the measurements shall be at the discretion of the Contractor and must be described in detail in their proposal.  Differences from the methods described below shall be justified in their proposal.

Heart Rate:  Use a metric rule to measure 5 RR intervals in mm from the middle of the ECG hard copy, then get corresponding heart rate from a Look-up Table for Heart rate and QT rate correction coefficient.

P-R Interval:  The P-R interval should typically be read from lead II.  1) To determine the onset of the P-wave find the point underneath the baseline where the rise begins to form the P-wave (A); from that point project a vertical line upward to the point where the line crosses the top of the baseline (B); B is the beginning of the P-wave. 2) In case of an initial R-wave, the beginning of QRS is measured from the lower edge of the baseline; when the QRS pattern is a QS-wave, onset is measured at the upper edge of the baseline; when the QRS begins with a Q, its onset is measured from the upper edge of the baseline.

Q-Wave:  1) Q-wave amplitude will be measured vertically from the onset of the QRS at the lower margin of the baseline to nadir. 2) QS-wave amplitude will be measured vertically from the onset of the QRS at lower margin of the baseline to nadir.  3) Q-wave duration is measured on the top of the baseline from the beginning of the Q to where the Q intersects the scale.  If a stepped shoulder precedes the steeper descend of the Q-wave, it is included in the measurement of the Q-wave.

R-wave amplitude is measured vertically from the onset of the QRS at the upper margin of the preceding PR baseline to the peak of the R.

QRS axis:  1) measurements are taken on the next to last complete normal beat in leads, I, II and III defined as that normal beat which immediately precedes the last normal codable beat.  If there are only two beats in a lead, the measurements should be taken on the last complete normal beat.  2) To determine the amplitude of the main positive wave (whether R or R’), measure from the upper baseline margin at the onset of QRS to the peak of the R- or R’- wave.  For the amplitude of negative waves, measure from the lower margin of the baseline at QRS onset to the nadir of the largest wave.  R’ is a second R-wave.  3) Measurements of positive or negative waves are rounded up to the nearest 0.25mm.  4) If the sum of the positive and negative waves is not a whole number, it should be rounded up to the nearest 0.5mm.

QRS duration:  (1) QRS duration in Lead II only; or (2) Maximum QRS duration from records with simultaneous 12 lead recording, usually take measurement at Lead V2-V5.

J-point:  1) The amplitude of J-point depression is measured vertically to the intersection of a tangent drawn horizontally from the upper margin of the PR baseline at the onset of the QRS.  J-point depression is measured in mm.  The reference for determining J-point displacement is the upper margin of the baseline immediately preceding the QRS complex.  2) If a break in the curve between QRS and ST segment can be seen, but the exact point is indeterminate, a tangent is drawn along the straightest section to be found (one at least 2 mm in length) of the lower margin of the ST segment at the beginning of ST.  The J-point is on the upper margin opposite the point the tangent and the ECG separate.  3) Where there is not straight part of the ST segment at least 2 mm long for constructing a tangent, a truly curved ST segment exists and no J-point is measured.  4) When two separate breaks in the curve at the end of the QRS are observed, take the second or rightward point to determine the J-point for 4-codes.  5) When the S-wave continues in a smooth curve to the peak of the T-wave, the end of the QRS is determined from where a horizontal tangent from the upper margin of the baseline at the beginning of the previous QRS complex intersects the upward curve.  6) When the end of the ST segment merges with the T-wave, the ST segment is considered to extend to the peak of the T-wave.  7) When a near-perfect curve is present (no straight ST segment for at least 2 mm) there is no clearly defined ST segment.  With this type of ST-T there is no measurable J-point.

ST segment: 1) The ST slope is measured from the J-point to the start of the T-wave or to the peak of the T-wave.  2) The direction of the ST segment is classified as horizontal, downward or upward sloping based on the following rule:  the segment is not horizontal or downward sloping if any part of it slopes upward.  This also applies to curved or U-shaped ST segment.  3) If the amplitude at the end of the ST segment is lower than the J-point, this convex pattern is considered equivalent to a downward sloping ST segment and is so coded.  4) Leads a VR and II are ignored in coding ST segment and T-wave.

T-wave: 1) The degree of negativity is measured from the bottom of the ensuing TP interval.  2) To measure a negative T-wave, find the flattest segment of the baseline in the following TP interval.  Measure from this point on the lower margin of the baseline vertically to the point that intersects a horizontal line extended from the lower margin of the T-wave nadir.  3) The negative T-wave amplitude is always measured in mm.  4) The negative T-wave amplitude in a diphasic T-wave is measured from the level part of the TP interval at its lower margin. 5) When a rapid heart rate causes the T-wave to fall on the following P-wave, use the previous PR interval as the reference point for measuring positive T-waves.  

QT duration:  (1) QT duration in Lead II only; or (2) Maximum QT duration from 12 Leads, most from lead V2 – V4 or AVR.

Q.R.S Amplitudes for high voltage identification.  Basic measurement is R amplitude in Lead AVL and S/QS amplitude in lead V3.

4)	Provide detailed description of ongoing internal quality control procedures.

Receivables

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
The NSRP Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) Program is interested in receiving abstracts and ultimately proposals (technical and cost) on the research effort described below. The NSRP ASE program goal is to reduce the cost of building and maintaining U.S. Navy warships. To accomplish this, NSRP ASE is focused on industry-wide implementation of solutions to common cost drivers – solutions to consensus priority issues that exhibit a compelling business case to improve the efficiency of the U.S. Shipbuilding and Ship Repair Industry. Solutions include both leverage of best commercial practices and creation of industry-specific initiatives. Aggressive technology transfer to, and buy-in by, multiple U.S. shipyards is a requirement of all funded efforts. Successful projects are those that clearly reduce total ownership costs with benefits that can be delivered by varied combinations of cost reductions in acquisition and fleet life-cycle costs. Identification of specific cost reduction manifestation is an important element of NSRP program.  The complete Research Announcement (RA) is posted at www.nsrp.org. The Research Announcement will be modified as necessary to reflect changes in industry and/or government priorities.  Potential proposers are advised that there are several changes incorporated in this year's solicitation that bear particular attention, including cost share requirements and project metrics.

Teaming
Teaming arrangements are encouraged. At least one U.S. shipyard should be substantially involved in each project, normally in a leadership role. Exceptions to this may be considered on a case-by-case basis where there is compelling justification that the program mission is best served by the proposed deviation. 

Awards
Due to limited funding, the NSRP ASE Program reserves the right to limit awards under any topic, and only proposals considered to be of superior quality will be funded. The NSRP ASE Program reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received. The amount of funding available will be dependent upon receipt of Government Fiscal Year 2005 funds.  Awards will be made using a Technology Investment Agreement. These assistance instruments are not subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). A copy of the NSRP ASE Program Technology Investment Agreement is available on the NSRP Web site (www.nsrp.org) under R&D Programs. 

For those proposals that are approved for award by the Executive Control Board (ECB), a letter contract will be executed immediately after the selection meeting.  This letter contract is expected to be for a period of 30 days with sufficient funding to conduct project kickoff activities.  All proposers, unless exceptions are authorized by the ECB for unusual circumstances (e.g., significant changes to the SOW directed by NSRP), will be expected to sign the final agreement within 30 days of selection. The NSRP ASE Program reserves the right to terminate awards if the offeror is not able to conclude a formal, signed Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) within 30 calendar days of selection notification.  

RA Process: This is an unrestricted solicitation. 

Proposal Preparation and Submittal
Offerors should obtain a copy of the latest NSRP Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise Proposal Preparation Kit (currently version 4.4 - available from the NSRP ASE and NSRP Web site at www.nsrp.org).  This guide is specifically designed to assist offerors in understanding the RA proposal process.  The proposal format provided in the PPK is mandatory.  A link for submitting questions regarding the proposal process will be provided at www.nsrp.org.  All questions received and corresponding answers will be posted to this site (publicly accessible).  In addition, the NSRP ASE Program will host a proposer’s conference on September 1, 2004 at the Advanced Technology Institute, North Charleston, SC, to provide an overview of the program, explain the process, and answer general questions.

REQUIREMENTS

Technical Description
This announcement is issued to solicit proposals for research, development and implementation of best practices in U.S. shipyards as described in detail in the Strategic Investment Plan (SIP). A synopsis of the six major initiatives follows:
	
	SHIPYARD PRODUCTION PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES
Shipyard Production Process Technologies addresses all production processes used to transform raw material, services, components, equipment, and interim products into completed products. Specifically, these processes include steel, aluminum and composites fabrication, sub-assembly, assembly and erection, outfit fabrication, installation and test, surface preparation and coating, joining, process control (accuracy control and process management), and services (transportation and rigging). This announcement includes potential efforts in all six related sub-initiative areas

BUSINESS PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES  
Business Process Technologies encompass all business processes from initial business strategy development to post-delivery customer service, required to rapidly and effectively respond to the marketplace.   This announcement includes potential efforts in four related sub-initiative areas: Sourcing and Supplier Integration; Planning and Production Design Processes; Pre-Contract Processes; and, Contracting Processes

	PRODUCT DESIGN AND MATERIAL TECHNOLOGIES
Product Design and Material Technologies include the parametric design rules, metrics, design and material standards, design and analysis tools, and engineering data required to rapidly and efficiently design modern ships in response to market inquiries and to support the follow on contract design, detail design and production phases. This major initiative includes the identification and development of advanced product designs and materials to support development of the next generation of high performance ships. This announcement includes potential efforts in four related sub-initiative areas:  Advanced Product Designs and Materials; Portfolio of Preliminary Designs; Parametric Design Rules and Metrics; and, Material Standards.
	
	SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES
The overall application of information technologies to shipbuilding is categorized as Systems Technologies within the Strategic Investment Plan. The scope of systems technologies includes the underlying information systems infrastructure required to support the other initiatives with emphasis on the tools, environment, and integration required to reduce product realization lead time and provide for tighter coupling between enterprise functions. For the purpose of this initiative, the scope of Systems Technologies can be characterized as an “Integrated Shipbuilding Environment” (ISE). This announcement includes potential efforts in six of the eleven sub-initiative areas: CAM Interfaces; XML Definition for Interoperability; Evolution of STEP; Advanced Design, Simulation, Analysis and Estimating; and, Parts Library Catalog System (Prototype Development and Full Deployment).
	
	FACILITIES AND TOOLING
Facilities and tooling includes the functions of providing and maintaining a physical plant capable of assembling, modifying and repairing ships in an efficient, safe, controllable and ecologically acceptable manner. This Major Initiative focuses on asset management issues such as facility utilization, facility planning, maintenance, and capital investment strategies.  Additionally, included with this Major Initiative are several risk avoidance issues such as environmental, safety, health, and ergonomic practices within the shipyard.  
	This announcement includes potential efforts in all five related sub-initiative areas. 

	CROSSCUT INITIATIVES
Crosscut initiatives encompass the key factors related to people and organizations that can impact the successful implementation of technology advancements and changes in the shipbuilding and repair industry. These factors integrate into all of the major initiatives identified in the NSRP ASE program.  This announcement seeks both separate projects that focus on the crosscut factors in general, as well as proposed crosscut solutions developed as supporting elements of the other major ASE initiatives.  This announcement includes potential efforts in all four related sub-initiative areas. 

SPECIFIC INTEREST AREAS

Lean Enterprise Concepts
While not a separate major initiative, of particular interest during this solicitation are initiatives directed toward furthering the U.S. shipbuilding and ship repair industry’s adoption of Lean enterprise practices.  Shipyards have begun to realize the benefits of applying Lean enterprise principles across the entire value stream from supplier to the final customer.  There is industry interest in follow-on efforts that will build on the implementation of basic Lean practices by introducing into shipbuilding and ship repair more advanced Lean concepts and the means of integrating Lean with Six Sigma and other process improvement and quality improvement programs.  Additionally, there is Congressional interest in seeing demonstration programs that apply Lean manufacturing technologies and processes to DOD acquisition programs in order to reduce total ownership cost, beginning with concept development and continuing through developmental testing.

Nationwide Shipyard Integration/Interoperability Concepts
The Navy continues to ask NSRP to extend, develop and implement collaborative approaches that support nationwide shipyard integration/interoperability, including but not limited to Common Parts Catalog (CPC) type approaches.  The NSRP Strategic Investment Plan and the current Research Announcement are both structured to support these types of projects.  Because of this interest, an area of project concentration included in this solicitation is continuing efforts related to Common Part Catalog (CPC) Initiatives, which have developed common processes and procedures for part definition and configuration management across shipyards. This inter-shipyard collaborative concentration supports industry’s Strategic Investment Plan (SIP).  The CPC Project supports integrated design/manufacturing initiatives and provides the required data definition to support material control systems. Standardizing part data allows an organization to search and find parts more quickly and accurately, permits re-use of part data, facilitates the ability to share inventory among collaborating organizations, and results in fewer parts to procure, inspect and warehouse.  This standardization results in increased demand for standard parts, which allows suppliers to better serve industry and organizations to benefit from volume discounts.  Further, the U.S. Navy benefits by needing fewer parts to support ships on-station and through the greater availability of parts across surface ship and submarine inventories.  During the 2003 NSRP solicitation, projects were proposed and selected to complete the development and implementation of CPC capabilities at four 1st Tier yards, develop the capability for 2nd Tier yards, and conduct assessments at two other 1st Tier yards.  

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 

Deliverable Items:  Deliverable data items that shall be proposed are listed in the Proposal Preparation Kit. 

Security Requirements: Classified material is not expected to be used on this effort.

Proposers are encouraged to review the technology transfer guide available on the NSRP web site.

Page Limitations
The technical proposal shall be limited to 40 pages (fixed pitch font of 12 or fewer characters per inch or proportional font point size 10 or larger), single-spaced, single-sided, 21.6 x 27.9 cm (8.5 by 11 inches). Smaller type may be used in figures and tables, but must be clearly legible.  Margins on all sides (top, bottom, left, and right) should be at least 2.5 cm (1 inch). The page limitation includes all information, except the Cover Page, Table of Contents, List of Figures and Tables, Cross Reference to Evaluation Criteria, Resumes, Statement of Work, Letters of Commitment, and Teaming Agreement/Memorandum of Agreement.  Pages in excess of this limitation will not be considered. Offerors are advised that the number of pages should be commensurate with the degree of complexity of the proposed effort.  It is expected, and encouraged, that less complex, less expensive proposals will be significantly less than 40 pages in length. Cost proposals have no page limitations; however, offerors are requested to keep cost proposals to less than 45 pages as a goal.  

Preparation Cost: This announcement does not commit the program to pay for any response preparation cost. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered a direct charge to any resulting award or any other contract. 

BASIS FOR AWARD

The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of an offeror's response (both technical and cost aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the announcement. Details of the evaluation criteria are provided in the Proposal Preparation Kit, and are summarized below:

Technical Aspects: The technical aspect, which is ranked as the first order of priority relative to the other factors (cost share, proprietary content, and cost aspect), shall be evaluated based on the following criteria:  Strategic fit and leverage; Business case; Innovation and technical merit; Technology transfer and industry implementation; and, Team strength and management plan.  The first is the most important technical factor. Proposals that do not meet the strategic fit and leverage criteria will not be recommended for award.  The other four technical factors are of equal importance to each other.  Each is defined in greater detail in the Proposal Preparation Kit. Given the relatively late start in this Research Announcement cycle and the associated challenges in being able to execute the program, proposers are encouraged to demonstrate evidence of a committed team ready to move out quickly upon award with an aggressive, credible execution schedule.  Proposals that demonstrate such commitment will benefit during the technical evaluation process when compared to otherwise equally acceptable proposals that do not show such commitment.

Other Factors
a.	Cost share: The proposal shall demonstrate a commitment to share the cost and risk of the proposed effort. The NSRP ASE program goal is 50% cost share (i.e., for every dollar of program funding provided, industry will provide at least one (1) dollar in cost share). Additional information regarding allowable types of cost share can be found in the NSRP ASE Proposal Preparation Kit.
b.	Shipyard Specific Projects: Most of the program funding will be applied toward open, collaborative projects that are widely acceptable with broad applicability.  For this reason, most projects will be recommended for award on the basis of sharing results within the U.S. industry. Proposals with a higher degree of results that are openly shared and readily transferable throughout the industry will be viewed more favorably.

Cost Aspects: Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles.

The contractor will provide unique services or optimization for their databases, including assistance with Visual Links modeling of financial data; assistance with DIG modeling of financial data; suggestions for updates/modifications to the databases to better support modeling efforts; development of reports and a Report Certification Process for reports published to the enterprise (these reports are anticipated to be consumed by the general user population rather than the researchers. Researchers will likely create their own ad-hoc reports, as needed, and will have specialized reports to meet their needs.)  Data may also be used to prepare Reports that may be used and cited by specialists, revenue agent reports, and other reports or papers prepared in the normal course of IRS business operations.  These derivative reports and papers will be shared with IRS customers, CPA firms, law firms, and other outside entities as required by operations.  The products shall be in compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

Paragraph  (a) shall read - The Contractor shall deliver three (3) rolls within 10 calendar days from the date of the award to the Government at the delivery address specified above (under “Delivery”) for first article testing. The shipping documentation shall contain this order number and all Lot/Item identifications. The characteristics that the first article must meet and the testing requirements are specified elsewhere in this order.  Paragraph (b) shall read - Within 30 calendar days after the Government receives the first article, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor, in writing, of the conditional approval, approval, or disapproval of the first article. The notice of conditional approval or approval shall not relieve the Contractor from complying with all requirements of the specifications and all other terms and conditions of this order. A notice of conditional approval shall state any further action required of the Contractor. A notice of disapproval shall cite reasons for the disapproval. TESTING REQUIREMENTS:  Test rolls will be inspected to ensure compliance with specifications. Test rolls will be inspected upon receipt at the Middle River Warehouse to ensure that the rolls have been received without obvious defects (e.g. if the paper is wet, torn, or wrinkled, it will not be accepted). Test rolls will be held in SSA's printer area for a minimum of three calendar days to allow for proper acclimatizing. The rolls will then be used on the appropriate machinery to ensure that the paper meets all requirements for surface stability, vapor emissions, print quality maintenance and fusing quality. The core must function properly without shifting of the paper or jamming. More than one non-compliant roll in the test group constitutes failure. If the test rolls pass these requirements, SSA will give conditional approval of the test rolls. The Government will have an additional 30 days to ensure that the paper has no detrimental effects on the printing equipment. Additional criteria that may be assessed during this period are: (1) the continued use of the paper must not result in the emission of odor-causing compounds such as sulfur compounds, chlorides, rein-based aerosols or organics; 2) any coatings on the paper must not cause fusing failures; 3) the paper must not cause fusing failures due to the inclusion of synthetic resins synthetic sizing agents or plastics; 4) the paper must not create excessive dust. The amount of paper dust generated must not exceed 75-260 micrograms per cubic meter (SSA Health code standard) or cause printer malfunctions and operator interventions; and 5) paper must not have additives or other conditions that reduce print quality. If the paper fails to meet these criteria during this period, SSA reserves the right to cancel the order.
