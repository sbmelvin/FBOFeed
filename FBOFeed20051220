Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to Debra A. Keith via e-mail at dkeith@mp.usbr.gov. The principal components of the work to be performed under the specifications include the following: A.  General Requirements - Administrative requirements, procedural requirements, temporary facilities, and controls which apply to the execution of work. B.  Schedule A - Schedule A of Phase II of the American River Pump Station project consists of Primary and Emergency river intake structures, an Obermeyer-type maintenance gate, channel and cofferdam grading, channel erosions protection measures including grouted rock and riprap, intake structure access roads and surfaces, hatches up to 8 feet by 12 feet in size, air and water piping from the pump station to the intake contained in a utility trench and a concrete-encased 48-inch diameter casing pipe beneath the river for future extension of the 30-inch diameter GDPUD pipeline from the pump station to the south side of the river.  The river intake structures will provide water to the American River Pump Station constructed under Phase I and are to be constructed on the north bank of the American River channel directly beneath the pump station.      1.  Primary Intake Structures - The Primary Intake structure consists of a reinforced concrete and grouted boulder chute with tilted, wedge-wire intake screens and air backwash.  Collection chambers beneath the screens deliver diverted water to six 30-inch diameter reinforced concrete pipes.  The concrete pipes carry diversions to the Intake Vault at the existing pump station tunnel entrance and are controlled by manually operated knife-gate valves.      2.  Emergency Intake Structure - The Emergency intake will consist of a coarse bar screen divided into four separate chambers.  Each of the four chambers discharges to a concrete box collection conduit behind the intake through various sized openings.  The collection conduit varies in size from 3.5 foot by 3.5 foot to 6 foot by 6 foot.  Flows collected in the collection conduit are controlled by a manually operated 6 foot by 6 foot cast iron sluice gate.  The sluice gate discharges to a maintenance and sedimentation vault which in turn discharges to a 7 foot by 7 cast-in-place Emergency Intake Conduit.  The Emergency Intake conduit extends approximately 80 feet to the Intake Vault at the existing pump station tunnel entrance.      3.  Maintenance Gate - A 16 foot wide by 9 foot high Obermeyer-type maintenance gate is located between the Primary and Emergency Intakes.  The gate will allow river flows less than 2,500 cfs to be diverted away from the Intake Channel to facilitate maintenance work.      4.  Channel Modifications - Channel modifications will consist of grouted rock and riprap lining of an approximate 900 foot reach of the American River channel at the location of the intake structures and additional riprap protection of the cofferdam for another 900 feet upstream.  A 30-foot depth cutoff wall extends approximately 220 feet across the channel at the entrance to the intake area.  In addition to the grouted rock protection, channel modifications will include construction of a new channel cross section through plug areas located at the tunnel entrance and exit.      5.  Air and Water Piping - Air and water piping will extend from the pump station a distance of approximately 140 feet down the valley side to the Intake Vault structure.   Piping will include:           a.  4- to 8-inch diameter ductile iron, steel and stainless steel lines for air backwash of the Primary Intakes;  2-inch diameter stainless steel pipe for inflation of the Obermeyer Maintenance Gate;  6-inch diameter ductile iron line for washdown at the intake:  ?-inch diameter nylon tubing in 6-inch PVC carrier pipe for actuation of backwash system pneumatic butterfly valves;  ?-inch diameter tubing contained in carrier pipes for level sensing and flushing of stilling wells;  additional 6-inch PVC carrier pipes  for future use.  All of the above located in an excavated rock trench between the Pump Station Vault and the Intake Vault backfilled with flowfill.  Trench conditions below the Intake Vault vary.           b.  6 pneumatically actuated butter fly valves located in the Intake Vault controlled by 6 solenoid valves located in the Pump Station Vault and linked to a SCADA system.      6.  Intake Access - Access to the top surfaces of the intake structures and Obermeyer Gate for maintenance work will be provided by a drive-down access road.  Access to the interiors of the Emergency Intake and the Intake Vault will be provided through hatches up to 8 feet by 12 feet in size.   The largest hatches are intended to allow both a skidsteer and a large sediment bin to be lowered into the structure.  The bin could be used in combination with a skid-steer to remove accumulated sediment.      7.  GDPUD Pipeline - A 48-inch diameter concrete encased casing pipe is to be constructed across the river channel upstream of the Emergency Intake.  The casing pipe will provide for future construction of the proposed 30-inch diameter GDPUD steel pressure line currently stubbed out at the Pump Station east wall.        8.  Closure of the River Diversion Tunnel - The inlet and outlet of the existing 33-foot diameter horseshoe shaped diversion tunnel will be closed. The inlet closure shall consist of sheet piles linked together and supported at the top and bottom to cover the tunnel opening.  The entrance will then be backfilled to cover the face of the sheet piles. The tunnel outlet shall be closed with rock fill. The rock fill shall be allowed to fall into its natural angle of repose inside the tunnel. The outside rock fill slope shall not exceed two horizontal to one vertical. Approximately 1520 square feet of sheet pile and 8 cubic yards of concrete will be required for closure of the tunnel inlet. Approximately 9000 cubic yards of rock fill will be required for closure of the tunnel outlet.       9.  Diversion Access Road - An access road shall be constructed from the existing pump station site to the intake structure in schedule A. The access road shall be concrete over an aggregate base and the work will include guardrail and drainage facilities. Total length of road to be constructed is approximately 552 feet. C.  Optional Schedule B - Schedule B of Phase II of the American River Pump Station project consists of the Public Access Components of the project. The Public Access Components consist of a park entrance building, parking areas and turnarounds, improvements to access roads, and construction of a new trail.      1.  Park Entrance Building - A 10-foot by 22-foot, single story, block masonry building will be constructed just off Maidu Drive at the entrance to the park.  The building will have water and electrical service.  A precast concrete sanitary vault will be installed to provide sewer service for the building.      2.  Parking Areas and Turnarounds - A paved and striped parking area, consisting of approximately 15 spaces (1 ADA), will be constructed just off Maidu Drive.  The parking area will include a drinking fountain, trash containers, and a kiosk.  A second parking area, consisting of a paved and striped parking area consisting of approximately 50 spaces (2 ADA), will be constructed at the existing Auburn Dam Batch Plant site just above Oregon Bar.  The parking area will include bathrooms, trash containers, and a kiosk. Fencing shall be placed around the existing ponds in this area. Construction of the Maidu and Batch Plant parking areas will consist of minor grading for drainage purposes.  A third parking area will be constructed solely for ADA access near the river channel on a rock bench approximately 1200 feet Northwest of the existing diversion tunnel outlet.  The gravel ADA parking area will be approximately 80 feet by 80 feet.  A gravel road approximately 520 feet long and 15 feet wide will be constructed from an existing road to the ADA parking area.  A turnaround area, to be used by the Department of Parks and Recreation and emergency vehicles, will be constructed next to the river channel approximately 100 feet Northeast and down grade from the ADA parking area.  The gravel turnaround will be approximately 30 feet by 50 feet.  The ADA parking area, ADA access road, and turnaround area will require rock and common soil excavation.  Another gravel turnaround will be constructed near Oregon Bar.  The turnaround will be approximately 50 feet by 50 feet.  Construction of this turnaround will consist mainly of grubbing existing shrubs and some minor grading.      3.  Improvements to Access Roads - Approximately 6,900 linear feet of 24-foot wide existing paved road between Maidu Drive and the Batch Plant parking area will be improved by overlaying the entire width of the existing paved area. Approximately 4,200 linear feet of 24-foot wide existing dirt road between the Batch Plant parking area and river turnaround will be improved.  The improvements will consist of grading to smooth the road and then installing a gravel base. Approximately 4,450 linear feet of 15-foot wide existing dirt road between the Batch Plant parking are and the Oregon Bar take-out area will be improved.  The improvements will consist of grading to smooth the road and then installing a gravel base.  Culverts will also be installed along the road to provide adequate drainage.      4.  Trail - A 4-foot wide trail, approximately 3,920 linear feet, will be constructed between the Batch Plant parking area and the Oregon Bar turnaround area.  The construction of the trail will consist of removal of boulders, grading and grubbing.  Also, drainage facilities such as culverts and bridges shall be constructed along the trail. The total length of trail to be constructed is approximately 3,920 feet.

NGA intends to issue Solicitation HM1572-06-R-0004 as part of a competitive procurement for the Support to Management and Resources for Technical Services (SMARTS) Program.   NGA has a mission critical need for contractor provided support to management across a wide range of daily activities, and skilled resources for required technical operational services.  The SMARTS effort is for management support and other technical services including but not limited to web design services, speech writing services, management services, financial management services, and program and project support services.  These services provide indispensable program, project and office level support and in their aggregate, contribute to the efficient and effective daily execution of NGA corporate mission objectives.

This work will be performed principally at the NGA Washington, DC metropolitan area and St. Louis area locations, although support may be extended to NGA organizations globally.  Due to the sensitive nature of the work at NGA, all contractor personnel working in NGA facilities shall be required to be U.S. Citizens and have the appropriate Top-Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) clearance.  NGA encourages teaming arrangements.  Prospective companies will be required to provide a security plan as part of any proposal and must be capable of sustaining a sufficient cadre of cleared personnel to support NGA.

The estimated IDIQ period of performance is from date of award through twelve (12) months, with four (4) option years (5 year total).  Individual task orders will typically include a twelve (12) month base period with four (4) option years.  This acquisition will be conducted using both full and open competition procedures and small business set-aside procedures.  Award of IDIQ contracts will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15.  

NGA anticipates issuing task orders as cost plus fixed fee term, firm fixed price, firm fixed price level of effort, time and material or labor hour contracts.   Potential offerors should submit the following information to SMARTS@nga.mil no later than 4:00 p.m. on 12 January 2006:

The follow-on solicitation notice will be placed on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), http://www.fedbizopps.gov prior to the release of the RFP.     For security reasons, all potential offerors are required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), http://www.ccr.gov and the FedTeDS, https://www.fedteds.gov in order to view or download RFP information.

NGA will post a notice of release of the final RFP through www.fedbizopps.gov; however, changes or additions to documents will be posted directly to FedTeDs and will not be announced through the www.fedbizopps.gov site.  Please be advised that it is the sole responsibility of prospective offerors to check the FedTeDs site regularly in order to remain current with posted information and related documents.

The following tentative milestone schedule is being provided to facilitate planning.  Changes to the schedule may occur as needed.  Updated schedule information will be posted on www.fedteds.gov.  This will be an electronic solicitation release.  No hard copies will be mailed.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The Belgian Ministry of National Defense intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the replacement and upgrade of the monitoring and safety equipment in 3 high pressure pump stations (HPPS) and the modernization of the static and dynamic control in 17 HPPS at sites in Belgium.

The Belgium Ministry of Defense is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. The NATO references for the project are 4/1/L.704 and 4/1/L.702. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFB-04-01-L704-L702.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The project is being split up into two contracts and lots:

Contract 1 (4/1/L.704): 
Replacement/upgrade of the monitoring and safety equipment in 3 HPPS  
Cost estimate: Euro 966,000 (USD $1,149,000) 
Duration of works: 250 working days

Contract 2 (4/1/L.702): 
Modernization of the static and dynamic control in 17 HPPS
Cost estimate: Euro 4,446,000 (USD $5,288,000)  
Duration of works: 380 working days

The security classification of the works will be NATO UNCLASSIFIED.
 
BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE (Specimen in Annex V to Ref.A of NSIP Document 2261) is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued. 
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 7 February 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) to those on the Bidders List: March 2006

3. Anticipated closing date for submittal of bids: May 2006

4. Anticipated contract award date: TBD

The level-of-effort contract will require direct labor, supervision, administrative support to provide a wide spectrum of intermediate and depot level overhaul, repair and modernization services and repairs in support of operational nuclear powered submarines, floating dry-docks, support and service craft, and other platforms and equipment. Work will be performed at the submarine base in New London, CT with occasional efforts at the company’s shipyard in Groton, CT. The dynamics of submarine force operation requires a NEMMI capable of supplementary workforce comprised of EB employees at Naval Submarine Support Facility New London to accomplish operational submarine maintenance, repair and modifications necessary to maintain!   fleet readiness and operational commitments.  This requires a NEMMI contractor to be a nuclear qualified shipyard and to maintain a staff in close proximity to SUBASE, New London capable of rapidly providing the necessary mix of personnel.  Electric Boat Corporation is the only source with a nuclear qualified shipyard staff within the necessary proximity of SUBASE, New London capable of meeting the NEMMI requirements. (See Note 22)

Requirements are fulfilled competitively on a task order basis by individual ordering offices.  Heavy emphasis is placed on Performance Based Orders.  Goal is to award 33% of total obligated dollars to small businesses as prime contractors.  Large business awards have a minimum Small Business Subcontracting Goal of 20% of the dollars obligated.  One award as a Prime Contractor is allowed to individual companies; however a contractor may be a subcontractor to multiple Primes.  There are seven geographic zones, Northeast; National Capital; Mid-Atlantic; Gulf Coast; Midwest; Pacific Northwest; and!   Southwest.  Task orders are competed in the zone that is the principa l place of performance.  Limits on pass-through, maximum fees, annual escalation, and cost savings are required.  Awards made during the rolling admissions process will have the same or similar characteristics.  Oral proposals are not contemplated.  Awards are intended to be made on initial offer without discussions.  The Government desires an increase in small business, hubzone, WOSB, SDVOSB, and 8(a) participation.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A  PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.   The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Consolidated Operations Acquisition Center (COAC) intends to negotiate and award  a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Mr. James Mitchell Jr., 9971 Good Luck Road  #104, Seabrook, Maryland 20706, to continue provide Technical Cardiology service to analyze ambulatory Holter monitor tape for arrhythmia patient care and research studies for the Clinical Cardiology Section of the Cardiology Branch/DIR/NHLBI. It is estimated that this service will be completed by January 2006. Background: The Clinical Cardiology Section of the Cardiology Branch/DIR/NHLBI,  performs ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring using specialized recording devises (Holter monitor) for clinical research and patient care purposes.  These recordings are necessary to determine causes of symptoms (episodic lightheadedness, loss of consciousness), to assess pacemaker function, and to determine risk of sudden death in patients with heart disease. Place of Performance: The work will be performed in the Clinical Center of the NIH Government Building #10, Center Drive, Room 7S248, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. All necessary equipment required to conduct the research will be provided by the government.  Requirements and Deliverables: A data analysis report will be generated and given to the requested physician. It is anticipated that approximately 45 tapes will be read and analyzed each month, depending on research and clinical demands.  Mr. Mitchell continues to perform this service with a high degree of efficiency and excellence. He has gained and in depth knowledge of the Cardiac arrhythmia studies. Shifting interpretations of the ambulatory monitor recording readings in the middle of the research project, could compromise the validity of data, possible leading to erroneous diagnoses and determination of the appropriate course of treatment. In order to maintain continuity of the methods used on reading and analyzing the ambulatory Holter monitor tapes. An award to any other source would affect the NIH’s anticipated outcome based upon Mr. Mitchell, experience, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.   The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541690 and the Size Standard is $6.0M. The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest  and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>Katie  Hoover Contract Specialist 3039692286     katie_hover@nps.gov;
<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE - Shuttle Bus Estes Park, Colorado - NAICS 485210 The National Park Service (NPS) is currently planning to sole source a service contract for the operation and maintenance of a shuttle bus route running from Estes Park, Colorado to the Rocky Mountain National Park (ROMO). The purpose of the acquisition is to link the gateway community of Estes Park with the existing shuttle system in Rocky Mountain National Park.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  An experimental shuttle service is being proposed to link the gateway community of Estes Park, Colorado with the existing shuttle system in Rocky Mountain National Park (ROMO).  ROMO has contracted for a Visitor Shuttle Transportation System within the park boundaries since 1978.  The current system is very popular with visitors and is a critical tool in meeting the park's visitor management goals.  Transportation Studies in 2000-2002 strongly recommend a seamless transportation system between the park and the gateway community of Estes Park.  This type of system will encourage visitors to leave their vehicles outside the park and serve as a means to help manage congestion.  This proposed experimental service will operate approximately 12 hours per day from approx. July 4th weekend through Labor Day weekend.  The route will be from Estes Park's new visitor center to the park's existing shuttle staging area on the Bear Lake Road, with one stop at the Beaver Meadows Visitor Center.  The distance is 8 miles one-way. The timed round trip route is 1 hour, thus there is proposed 12 daily trips between the park and the town on an hourly basis.  Approx. 69 days x 13 hours = 897 service hours.  SPECIAL CONSIDERATION:  Visitor Safety - minimum criteria for the one shuttle bus on this route to maximize visitor safety and convenience.  At a minimum, the bus on this route must:  -	Be no older than 10 years, -	be a maximum of 35 feet in length and seat 28 adult passengers, -	meet USDOT, OSHA and CDOT safety standards, -	meet current state and federal emissions standards and be tested regularly, -	meet ADA requirements, such that they are able to accommodate physically challenged riders, Lift U or Ricon wheelchair lift or equivalent, -	have large viewing windows, heating and air conditioning to maintain the passenger compartment at temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees F.,  -	have  entry/exit locations at both front and back of the bus and must offload on the right side, -	include interior railings for standees to hold onto, -	be free of advertising, unless provided by the NPS, -	be of a neutral color, such as white or light beige, to ensure a measure of conformity with the existing shuttle system in the park. -	The internal seating area and windows must be cleaned daily. The bus must be washed a minimum of twice weekly. All cleaning, maintenance and fueling must be arranged for in the community of Estes Park. There are no facilities within Rocky Mountain National Park. PERFORMANCE-BASED:  Proposals will be solicited using performance-based service contracting principles including use of a Performance Work Statement approach to define the requirements.   TERM:  The contract term is anticipated to include a base period of one year, with four one-year options to extend the contract at the Governments discretion.  The proposed award date is April 01, 2006 with a performance period of 69 days.  REASON JUSTIFYING SOLE SOURCE:  After completing market research and only receiving notification of interest from one contractor via a Request for Information (RFI) dated November 01, 2005, there is evidence to suggest there is only one contractor drawn to the proposed contract.  However, all responsible sources may submit a quote, which shall be considered by the Government.  SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:  Responses should be in a Word.doc, not to exceed ten (10) pages.  Responses should be submitted, via e-mail, to Katie Hoover at the following address katie_hoover@nps.gov or via fax at 303-969-2992.  Responses must be submitted no later than January 9, 2005.

<SOLNBR>RA06-07
<RESPDATE>013106
<ARCHDATE>01312007
<CONTACT>Dennis Polla, Program Manager, Phone xxxxxxxxxxxx, Fax 571-516-8761, Email dennis.polla@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Microelectromechanical/Nanoelectromechanical (MEMS/NEMS) S&T Fundamentals.  The MEMS/NEMS S&T Fundamentals effort is seeking research by means of multi-performer (university/ nonprofit/industry/other) focus centers dedicated to advancing a number of core technologies considered essential to the advancement of MEMS/NEMS technology for applications important to the Department of Defense (DoD).  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches capable of having a pervasive impact on continuing technology advances with significant potential for contributing to the transition of MEMS/NEMS technology into DoD systems.  The contemplated program is intended to foster the creation of multiple and highly interactive MEMS/NEMS focus centers composed of university, industrial, and government laboratory organizations.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals for focus centers in the following fundamental technology areas:  

•	Surface Physics: Understanding the chemical and physical nature of MEMS/NEMS surfaces, interfaces, and how bonds terminate.  Approaches directed toward enhancing fundamental understanding of the role of surfaces and materials interfaces during processing, device operation, and long-term reliability are desired.
•	Noise Mechanisms: Understanding noise limitations in MEMS/NEMS devices.  Approaches directed toward enhancing fundamental understanding of the ultimate limitations of all sources of noise to the performance of individual devices and more complex microsystems are desired.
•	Reliability Physics: Understanding the physical basis for failure in all types of MEMS/NEMS.  Fundamental work in this area might include scientific studies of fatigue of materials and interfaces at micro- and nano-scales.
•	Scaling Physics: Understanding dimensional scaling trade-off spaces in electrical, mechanical, optical, chemical, and biological MEMS, as well as limits to the dynamic range of scaled devices and systems.
•	Microfluidics: Understanding and controlled manipulation of fluids in micro- and nanosystems.  Issues related to the reliability physics and compatibility of fluidic components such as valves, pumps, capillaries, etc. 
•	Interconnections: Interfacing the nano-to-macro world; impedance matching between the macro, micro, and nano domains.
•	Single-Molecule Methods: Bottom-up construction of MEMS/NEMS structures and devices, surface functionalization, atom-by-atom engineering; self-replicating MEMS/NEMS.
•	Modeling: New methods for simulating MEMS/NEMS performances (e.g., understanding the limits in quality factor (Q) in vibrating micro- and nanomechanical resonators.
•	Signal Processing Methods:  Frequency domain versus time domain computation.
•	Other Areas:  Any fundamental technical issues critical to continuing development of NEMS/MEMS technology.

Focus centers must develop a balance between basic long-term research requirements in the MEMS/NEMS area and the more common industry focus on short-term specific technical problems.  All research conducted as part of the effort will be considered pre-competitive and must be openly shared among all participants through annual reviews.  


PROGRAM SCOPE
 
Collaborative university/nonprofit/industry proposals for fundamental research focus centers in the areas specified above are requested.  Proposals should address fundamental science and technology needs of the MEMS/NEMS community in the form of a three-year base program with up to three subsequent optional one-year phases.  The prime contractor for each MEMS/NEMS S&T Fundamentals focus center will be a single university or nonprofit organization.  Sub-contracted efforts to other universities and to selected organizations, including but not limited to industry program sponsors, are anticipated.  This arrangement is intended to ensure substantial and interactive participation among all program performers in pursuing technical program objectives.  Each selected MEMS/NEMS S&T Fundamentals focus center effort will require co-funding of the proposed research by one or more industry team members. Cost sharing by industry partners is required and will be an important evaluation criterion during the proposal review and performer selection process.  The DARPA:Industry cost-sharing ratios planned for the program will be 1.5:1 in Years 1-3, 1:1 in Year 4, and 1:2 in Years 5-6.  Cost sharing must be in the form of dollar resources provided by the industry partners to the selected awardee.  Additional cost sharing from universities and other government agencies will be eligible for DARPA matching but will not be an evaluation criterion.  

A web site - http://teaming.sysplan.com/RA_06_07/ has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this RA. Industry cost sharing is required and is an evaluation criterion.  The technical POC for this effort is Dr. Dennis Polla, fax:  (703) 516-8761; electronic mail: dennis.polla@darpa.mil.

Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the RA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  

This notice, in conjunction with the RA 06-07 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total Research Announcement.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP, RA, or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this RA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in MEMS/NEMS S&T Fundamentals. 

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this RA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding RA 06-07.  Proposals and proposal abstracts may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.


EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review by government personnel of each proposal using the following criteria:  (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism and required cost-sharing.  Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals that have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.  In addition, the documented amount of required matching funds from industry will be considered as an evaluation criterion.  Additional funding derived from universities and other government agencies used to directly support university research will be matched by DARPA but will not be considered as an evaluation criterion.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD) in Washington, DC intends to award a Purchase Order to the Regulatory Assistance Project (RAP) of Gardiner, ME under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The purpose of this purchase order is to educate state utility regulators about the benefits of Combined Heat Power (CHP) and Distributed Generation (DG).  State utility regulators will also be educated on ways to remove unintended policy barriers, which  prevent or hamper CHP/DG, particularly interconnection standards, partial-load rates, and inclusion in RPS.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620.    NO SOLICITATIONS OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   It has been determined that the  Regulatory Assistance Project (RAP) is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement as they have gained unique expertise and knowledge by working with public utility regulators in 45 states and several foreign countries.  Also, RAP has designed and conducted a national survey and  study of selected utility standby rates, which has enabled the organization to build relationships and contacts at numerous utilities across the nation, and also gives them a unique level of knowledge and detail on the subject, which cannot be gained by a reader of the study.  Furthermore, RAP was  the convener, facilitator and key participant in the national stakeholder development of a model DG emissions rule, which has provided them with significant experience discussing, analyzing and facilitating the development of language for state-wide regulations.  Notwithstanding, any firm that  believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement may be considered.  Responses to posting must be in writing and submitted to Nicole Humphrey, Contract Specialist at  humphrey.nicole@epa.gov.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Nicole Humphrey, Contract Specialist via e-mail at humphrey.nicole@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), a wholly-owned Federal Government Corporation, intends to award a contract to a qualified vendor who can provide physical examinations for AmeriCorps*NCCC, a residential national service program operated by the CNCS.  The AmeriCorps*NCCC engages young people ages 18 – 24 in team based service on projects in local communities throughout designated regions of the country.  The Central Region Campus is located at 3001 South Federal Blvd., Denver, Colorado and serves local community projects, as well as projects in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana and Michigan.  In case of disaster relief (i.e. Gulf Region hurricanes, forest fires), members may be sent to other state locations. 

During January 3, 2006 approximately 33 Team Leaders and on January 23, 2006, 260 Corps Members will arrive on the Central Region Campus with the understanding that each will have to take a physical examination similar to a pre-employment screening upon program entry.  Our program is rigorous with several essential work functions that make it imperative to assess each member’s fitness to perform safely in the program. Therefore, a health care provider is needed to conduct a physical examination on each member.

The physical exams will be conducted during two phases and includes several component parts in addition to a 10 panel drug test, “PPD testing” for tuberculosis and tetanus shots. 
 
Phase I - On January 3, 2006, 33 Team Leaders arrive on campus.  We would like to arrange for a physical examination at the provider’s facility on Wednesday, January 4, 2006, 1:30 pm to 5:00 pm.

Phase II - On January 23, 2006 additional members arrive on campus.  We would like to have the physical and drug testing to be done at the medical provider’s facility (one location).  Would like to schedule 65 members each day for 4 days, January 25, January 26 January 27 and January 28, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. We are requesting sufficient medical personnel be provided to insure the adequate, timely processing of approximately 65 members within a 8 hour day.  If some of the examination requirements cannot be provided on-site, the provider may submit alternatives for completing all requirements.

•	In addition, we require the results of the drug testing within 24 hours of the last test. TB PPD skin tests are to be read within 48-72 hours following the application. Medically trained personnel will read and evaluate the members TB skin results.

If Corps Members have medical conditions considered dangerous to their health if left untreated (e.g. previously unknown glucosuria or proteinuria, hypertension, possibility of malignancy, or any other defect that may jeopardize the Corps Member’s health), physicians will inform them orally of the problem and advise them to seek medical attention. The physician will document the findings and notify the NCCC staff liaison.

The requirements of the provider to perform the physical examination process are as follows: 
All medical providers (Doctors (M.D.s, D.O.s); Physician Assistants; Nurse Practitioners) performing or overseeing the performance of the physical examinations must have current, appropriate professional licenses to perform medical and other related services.

If Certified Physician Assistants and/or Certified Nurse Practitioners are utilized, an Internal Medicine Physician and/or Family Practitioner must also be on the premises performing or overseeing the performance of the medical examinations.

When the examining physician is of the opposite sex or when a member requests it, same-sex chaperones must be provided (there are significantly more female members than males – it is important that a sufficient number of female chaperones be made available).
 
A.	THE SCOPE OF THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS: 
    
•	A medical provider in a private one-on-one session will examine the mouth, eyes, lymph nodes, lungs, heart, breasts (females only), abdomen, and/or inguinal hernia/testicular exam (males only) of each member.

•	Dental review  (determine acceptability only)

•	Urine-albumin and sugar (reagent strips)

•	Urine pregnancy tests (all females)

•	Ortho/Neuro (excluding a duck-walk) exam.  Omit Ortho/Neuro exams for pregnant females.

•	Height and weight recording

•	Hair and eye color recording

•	Blood pressure and pulse recording

•	Vision, color vision and depth perception reading and recording

•	Hearing/audiometer (visualize tympanic membrane)

•	10 panel drug screening, with GCMS confirmation testing for positive results and a Medical Review Officer (MRO). The drugs to be screened for are:
  
-   Opiate Metabolites,Cocaine Metabolites,Amphetamines,PCP (Phencyclidine), Cannabis/THC,Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates, 
Methadone, Methaqualone, Propoxyphene

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), a wholly-owned Federal Government Corporation, intends to award a contract to a qualified vendor who can provide physical examinations for AmeriCorps*NCCC, a residential national service program operated by the CNCS.  The AmeriCorps*NCCC engages young people ages 18 – 24 in team based service on projects in local communities throughout designated regions of the country.  The Central Region Campus is located at 3001 South Federal Blvd., Denver, Colorado and serves local community projects, as well as projects in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana and Michigan.  In case of disaster relief (i.e. Gulf Region hurricanes, forest fires), members may be sent to other state locations. 

During January 3, 2006 approximately 33 Team Leaders and on January 23, 2006, 260 Corps Members will arrive on the Central Region Campus with the understanding that each will have to take a physical examination similar to a pre-employment screening upon program entry.  Our program is rigorous with several essential work functions that make it imperative to assess each member’s fitness to perform safely in the program. Therefore, a health care provider is needed to conduct a physical examination on each member.

The physical exams will be conducted during two phases and includes several component parts in addition to a 10 panel drug test, “PPD testing” for tuberculosis and tetanus shots. 
 
Phase I - On January 3, 2006, 33 Team Leaders arrive on campus.  We would like to arrange for a physical examination at the provider’s facility on Wednesday, January 4, 2006, 1:30 pm to 5:00 pm.

Phase II - On January 23, 2006 additional members arrive on campus.  We would like to have the physical and drug testing to be done at the medical provider’s facility (one location).  Would like to schedule 65 members each day for 4 days, January 25, January 26 January 27 and January 28, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. We are requesting sufficient medical personnel be provided to insure the adequate, timely processing of approximately 65 members within a 8 hour day.  If some of the examination requirements cannot be provided on-site, the provider may submit alternatives for completing all requirements.

•	In addition, we require the results of the drug testing within 24 hours of the last test. TB PPD skin tests are to be read within 48-72 hours following the application. Medically trained personnel will read and evaluate the members TB skin results.

If Corps Members have medical conditions considered dangerous to their health if left untreated (e.g. previously unknown glucosuria or proteinuria, hypertension, possibility of malignancy, or any other defect that may jeopardize the Corps Member’s health), physicians will inform them orally of the problem and advise them to seek medical attention. The physician will document the findings and notify the NCCC staff liaison.

The requirements of the provider to perform the physical examination process are as follows: 
All medical providers (Doctors (M.D.s, D.O.s); Physician Assistants; Nurse Practitioners) performing or overseeing the performance of the physical examinations must have current, appropriate professional licenses to perform medical and other related services.

If Certified Physician Assistants and/or Certified Nurse Practitioners are utilized, an Internal Medicine Physician and/or Family Practitioner must also be on the premises performing or overseeing the performance of the medical examinations.

When the examining physician is of the opposite sex or when a member requests it, same-sex chaperones must be provided (there are significantly more female members than males – it is important that a sufficient number of female chaperones be made available).
 
A.	THE SCOPE OF THE PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS: 
    
•	A medical provider in a private one-on-one session will examine the mouth, eyes, lymph nodes, lungs, heart, breasts (females only), abdomen, and/or inguinal hernia/testicular exam (males only) of each member.

•	Dental review  (determine acceptability only)

•	Urine-albumin and sugar (reagent strips)

•	Urine pregnancy tests (all females)

•	Ortho/Neuro (excluding a duck-walk) exam.  Omit Ortho/Neuro exams for pregnant females.

•	Height and weight recording

•	Hair and eye color recording

•	Blood pressure and pulse recording

•	Vision, color vision and depth perception reading and recording

<DESC>Reference the Market Survey Announcement published in the Federal Business Opportunities on 13 Dec. 2005, Subject:  B â€“ Propellant Testing Services, Solicitation No. W15QKN-06-X-0522.  The Response Date is extended from 28 Dec. 2005 to 4 Jan. 2006.  It is also emphasized, as is stated in the original Market Survey Announcement, â€œaward will be made from a General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Service Contractor, Schedule 871 Professional Engineering Services (PES)â€.  The following are clarifications based upon questions received on the Market Survey Announcement. The Sources Sought Notice indicates that the contractor is required to provide an Ammunition Operator for the project and suggests that the level of work would justify one full-time employee in this capacity for one year. This operator is not responsible for analysis and is not required to be present for that part of the process.  The operator is responsible for receipt and disposal handling of material, setup and execution of the accelerated aging of the sample material, and preparing the sample sheets that accompany the samples for analysis.  All facilities and equipment are GFM.  All work will be performed at the facilities in building 3029 and/or other building designated by the Government at the US Army RDECOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ. The flow of samples into the laboratory for analysis fluctuates based upon the requests of other Government offices for the laboratory services. Personnel are hired in a staffing function to provide services as needed.  Even though there will be fluctuations in the workflow, performance is required on a full-time basis.  The contractor employee will be accompanied by a Government employee for laboratory operations for security purposes. This effort is currently being accomplished under Other Transaction  DAAE30-01-9-0800, Task Order Sub-Agreement (TOSA) 0060. This TOSA was awarded in August 2005 to GEO-CENTERS (recently purchased by SAIC) and the prior contract number was DAAE30-00-D-1009, Task 0140 and Task 0141.

<DESC>LINE		DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLY	        QTY		
			
0001	Kevlar Combat Helmets (Level IIIA)	11,891	
        Green or Woodland Camouflage with Chin Strap

***  Helmets MUST meet NIJ Level IIIA specifications IAW NIJ Standard 0106.01 and meet MIL-STD-662E requirements.  NIJ Approved Laboratory V50 testing certificates documenting NIJ Level IIIA compliance must be submitted with proposals.  ANY OFFEROR WHO FAILS TO MEET SPECIFICATIONS OR PROVIDE COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION WILL BE DEEMED UNRESPONSIVE AND REMOVED FROM FURTHER CONSIDERATION.

Solicitation will be posted to FBO on 16 Dec 05. 

All quotes should be submitted to robert.brooks@pco-iraq.net

Preferred method of submission is email attachment.  Unable to receive faxes.


Q:  1) Can you please clarify line 0003, chin straps.  Our helmets come complete with chin straps, so we would not charge for this.  However, are you asking that we bid on 11891 replacement chin straps?
A:  Broke out the chin straps to ensure an offeror does not bid on helmets alone (it’s been known to happen)…if the chin straps are included with the helmet, then no need to bid separately…not asking for additional chin straps, just the 11891 that should accompany the helmet…

Q:  2) When referring to chin straps are you referring to the part of the harness that holds the chin or the entire harness which supports the helmet on the head?
A:  Chin only…

Q:  3) Are there any penalties for late delivery and if there are, what are the penalties?
A:  Late deliveries may result in consideration (a negotiated monetary reduction) or termination for cause, leading to poor past performance…this, of course, will impact the ability to compete in future buys, as non-responsible offerors would be thrown out of competition immediately…

Q:  Just to make sure I understand correctly, as long as an NIJ approved lab has performed testing in accordance with NIJ 0106.01 at threat level IIIA, you will accept that test report.  In other words, certification from the NIJ is not required as they do not have a standard they can certify to.
A:  You are correct…NIJ 0106.01 threat level IIIA from a certified lab…there is no certification letter for helmets that I am aware of…

Q:  Are these helmets to be constructed in the standard PASGT style, or was something different required? 
A:  PASGT (Ground Troop) Helmet is what were require...

Q:  Is there a “Berry Amendment/Buy American Act” Made In USA requirement in effect for this Solicitation? 
A:  No…Overseas/Contingency requirement…

Q:  Can the color be painted on the helmets or are covers required?
A:  Helmets must have covers…

Q:  Gentex Corporation currently is an approved supplier for the new Army ACH level IIIA helmets and also the new Lightweight Marine Corps helmet. We use both Kevlar and Twaron in our ballistic helmets. Twaron is a US government approved equivalent to Kevlar. Would it be permissible to use Twaron as all performance requirements will be met?
Also do you have a size ratio?
A:  Don’t see any problem with Twaron IF the vendor can provide the “U.S. Government approval” that they claim to have certifying it as acceptable.  

15% Small – 1,784 helmets
55% Medium – 6,540 helmets
30% Large – 3,567 helmets

Q:  1) You mention Mil Std 662E requirements.  It is my understanding that this is a test protocol used to measure v50 performance against certain projectiles.  Can you further define the minimum level of v50 required and the projectile to be used in the test?  
A:  You are correct…We are removing MIL STD 662E/V50 requirement…we would normally use a 17 grain FSP…with the way the solicitation is written, we do not list evaluation criteria for testing against this requirement…
 
Q:  2) You also mention the requirement for" NIJ approved laboratory V50 testing certificates documenting NIJ level IIIA compliance".  It is my understanding that a NIJ level IIIA compliance requires a V0 test result for certification.  Please clarify the requirement.  
A:  You are correct…V0 test is the requirement…V50 has been removed…
 
Q:  3) You mention NIJ 0106.01 certification.  Is the test data required the ballistic portion of this test only or is it also the Acceleration measurement portion.  If it includes the acceleration measurement portion testing then I am unaware of any NIJ certified lab that has the necessary equipment to perform this test.  
A:  Only ballistic…

<DESC>The Air Force intends to hold an Industry Day for preliminary market research and informational purposes as it relates to a Space Based Space Surveillance (SBSS) Objective System.  The goal of this session is to identify companies who are interested and qualified to participate in the study and subsequent development of this system.  In April 1996, an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) was launched to demonstrate Space-Based Space Surveillance Operations (SBSSO).  The SBSSO sensor, the Space Based Visible (SBV) telescope, is the last surviving sensor on the Mid-course Space experiment (MSX) and is soon to reach its end of life.  A follow-on system, known as SBSS Pathfinder, is currently in development to serve as a “gap-filler” to meet Space Control requirements for significantly improved detection and timeliness of high interest space event reporting until a future capability is developed to meet objective Space Control requirements.  The SBSS Objective System is the next-generation family of these systems. Notionally a constellation of electro-optical sensing satellites, SBSS Objective will search for, detect, and track objects in near earth and deep space orbits.  In order to facilitate FY06 acquisition activities, the SBSS Industry Day is planned for 25-26 Jan 06 in Building A-8 Auditorium of the Aerospace Corporation, El Segundo CA.  The agenda will include Government Program Office overview of the program along with a presentation of initial system requirements.  The briefing will take place at the Secret Collateral level; as such, please fax clearances to SMC/SY Security, 2420 Vela Way, Ste. 1866, Bldg. A-8, Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, CA 90245 Attn: Berta Chavez at (310) 416-1746.  As part of Industry Day, the SBSS project team will facilitate one-on-one discussions with interested contractors.  In addition to sending clearances, interested companies are limited to four (4) attendees each and should RSVP with Ms. Berta Chavez by telephone at (310) 416-1583, or by email: alberta.chavez@losangeles.af.mil. All clearances must be in NLT: 20 January 2005.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) The Product Manager Robotic and Unmanned Sensors is conducting a market survey to identify sources for the production of the Synthetic Aperture Radar/Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/GMTI) radar.  This includes the possibility of a Low Rate Initial Prod uction and the Full Rate Production. This is not a System Development and Demonstration program.  Systems requiring a significant Non recurring Engineering effort will not be considered a viable source of supply for this payload. This radar sensor shall be  capable of being integrated into the Extended Range Multi-Purpose and the Future Combat Systems Class IV Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).  The current SAR/GMTI payload consists of 2 Line Replaceable Units, a Radar Electronics Assembly that mounts within th e Air Vehicle and a Gimbal Assembly that mounts externally to the airframe.  The payload will be require to meet the threshold requirements outline in paragraph 1 below in addition to meeting the interface requirements outlined in the Interface Control Doc uments. The SAR/GMTI system will provide a Brigade Combat Team and Division/Corps battlefield commander with increased situational awareness by imaging stationary targets and detecting moving targets in adverse weather and through battlefield obscurants. The SAR/G MTI sensor shall be capable of detecting and classifying commercial sized vehicles (Pick up sized targets).  The information provided in response to this market survey will be used to support updating the acquisition strategy developed for the SAR/GMTI and  to justify any modifications required to the current program of record. Scope of Effort:  The government desires to enter a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase for the SAR/GMTI in the 1st Qtr FY 07. A Fixed Price type contract is anticipated for the LRIP contract and includes 4 production options for additional quantities .  The projected LRIP contract award date is 31 Dec 06.  Deliveries of systems shall commence 1 Feb 2008.  All deliveries shall be completed within 12 months of first delivery.  First Article Testing on the LRIP units shall be completed prior to the delive ry of the first unit.  The LRIP contract will also include a full supportability program to include the delivery of technical manuals, maintenance plans, training packages, etc.  The cost for the supportability requirements is not included in the $723K Ave rage Unit Production Cost AUPC.  The System Development and Demonstration contractor is General Atomics Reconnaissance Systems, San Diego, CA.  The anticipate LRIP and the Full Rate Production is not a fabrication of the SDD item currently under contract.  The Government does not have the detailed design/fabrication documentation or software source code to provide to a third party.  The government does not have a technical data package for the system.  The government requires that any LRIP and the full rate  production systems comply with the interface control documents for the current SDD system and these ICDs will be supplied.  To request for a copy of the ICDs , Contact Joe Brito (703-704-1988) at joseph.brito@belvoir.army.mil  The Government desires a S AR/GMTI capability that meets or exceeds the current Prime Item Performance Specification currently on Contract with the SDD contractor.  It is expected that a draft Prime Item Performance Specification may be provided on or before 15 Jan 2006.  However, t he minimum performance required by the SAR/GMTI system, production profile and Average Unit Production Cost is stated below: SAR/GMTI Key Performance Requirements: a.

<DESC>Description This is a sources sought synopsis intended to provide market research information for use in developing a solicitation for an effort to support the U.S. Space and Missile Defense Command, Future Warfare Center, Space and Missile Defense Battle Lab (SMDC-FW C-SMDBL).  Responses to this announcement will be used to identify interested qualified sources available in the marketplace.  Information requested from interested parties is described below. This special announcement has two purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from the small business community in support of the SMDC-FWC-SMDBL requirement; and (2) to roughly gauge the capability of those interested small business firms or teams as v iable contenders at the prime contractor level.  The briefings and associated evaluations discussed in this notice do NOT replace the in-depth evaluation of a firms or teams ability to perform, however, these will be utilized to make the final decision c oncerning the number and types of set-asides.  The responses to this notice are for Government planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a definitive intent to proceed with this acquisition. At this time, the Government does not intend to award more than one contract for this requirement.  Further, we are exploring the potential to maximize set-aside opportunities for the SMDC-FWC-SMDBL support acquisition.  As the Government is unsure of the extent of anticipated small and small disadvantaged business participation, it is undecided as to the specific number and/or set-aside awards to target during the development of its acquisition strategy.  Small businesses may team together (or even affilia te) and be eligible for award of a set-aside contract, PROVIDING THAT EACH TEAM MEMBER MEETS THE NAICS CODE SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD. The current Small Business Administrative (SBA) rules allow a set-aside when there is an expectation of two or more competitive offers from small business teams when at least 50% of the cost of contract performance will be performed by the collective effor ts of all small business members of the team.  The current SBA 8(a) affiliation rules allow joint ventures or teams when the 8(a) concern performs a significant amount of the work with its own employees and the size of at least one 8(a) participant to th e joint venture is less than one half the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract.  Such teams and/or joint ventures require the prior approval of the SBA.  A Service-Disabled Veteran Owned-Small Business Concern (SDVO-SBC) p rime contractor can subcontract part of a SDVO contract provided they spend at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel on the concerns employees or on the employees of other SDVO-SBCs.  A joint venture of at least one SDVO-SBC  and one or more other business concerns may submit an offer as a small business for a competitive SDVO-SBC procurement so long as each concern is small under the NAICS code size standard assigned to the contract.  A qualified HUBZone SBC prime contractor can subcontract part of a HUBZone contract provided they spend at least 50% of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel on the concerns employees or on the employees of other qualified HUBZone SBCs.  A joint venture of two or more quali fied HUBZone SBCs may submit an offer for a HUBZone contract so long as each concern is small under the NAICS code size standard assigned to the contract.  The joint venture itself need not be certified as a qualified HUBZone.  Further information regardin g teaming and joint ventures are located in the Code of Federal Regulations (13 CFR 124 and 125). NOTICE CONCERNING THE POTENTIAL FOR A WOMAN-OWNED SMALLBUSINESS SET-ASIDE:  If the implementing guidelines for a woman-owned set-aside are in place in a timel y manner to allow for such under this acquisition, the Government will consider such an award; therefore, i f such companies/teams are interested in pursuing this opportunity, you may also express your interest by submitting a capability White Paper which is explained below. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710 with a small business size standard of 1000 employees for this acquisition. The contractors will be expected to provide non-personal services for the newly reorganized U.S. Space and Missile Defense Command, Future Warfare Center, Space and Missile Defense Battle Lab (SMDC-FWC-SMDBL) to support its new mission set of Space, Near S pace, and Missile Defense Capabilities Integration and Development. The project is entitled the Concepts and Operations for Space and Missile Defense Integration and Capabilities (COSMIC).   The complete Statement of Work (SOW) is posted at the following website: http://www.smdc-armyforces.army.mil/ CONTRACTING WITH US -  Contracting Opportunities The resultant contract will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause.  To the greatest extent possible, while still protecting the Governments interest, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technology areas of the contr actors actual COSMIC performance. Any small business firms, including 8(a), HUBZone, SDVO, or Woman-Owned firms, intending to propose as a prime contractor (especially those planning to use the affiliation and teaming rules issued by the SBA) are invited to provide a capability White Paper  to the Government (limited to 10 pages).  Interested firms should submit an email stating interest in providing a White Paper to the Government within 30 days after the date of this announcement to Tim Myers at tim.myers@smdc-cs.army.mil (Subject line for  the email: COSMIC Capability White Paper).

<SUBJECT>Q -- Notice Of Bridge Contracts Extension
<DESC>The U.S. Navy’s Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to extend, on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, three bridge Multiple Award Task Order (MATO) contracts awarded on 28  September 2005 to the three MATO contractors who were awarded MATO contracts in fiscal year 2000. These MATO contractors currently provide Healthcare Worker services for the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD and its associated sites: Naval Health Clinic, Patuxent River, MD; Naval Health Clinic, Quantico, VA; and Naval Health Clinic, Annapolis, MD, as well as other Naval Health Care facilities in the Northeastern United States and at Naval Hospital, Great Lakes, IL. The current MATO contracts that require extended bridge services are as follows: N62645-05-D-5036 (Cherokee Medical Services, LLC. (Cherokee Medical)), N62645-05-D-5037 (Professional Healthcare, Inc. (Professional Healthcare)) and N62645-05-D-5039 (Arora Group, Inc.). The current contracts expire on 31 January 2005. The proposed bridge contracts’ extension Period of Performance will be from 1 Feb 05 to 31 May 06. The four-month Bridge Contracts extensions will continue to provide the minimum services that are currently being provided for the requiring agencies. In addition to the minimum quantities stated above, maximum quantities will be added to the bridge contracts extensions that will allow for the potential need of increased services. These maximum quantities will be mirrored on the three bridge awards to provide for competition between the three contractors for these services. The bridge contracts shall be placed in anticipation of the award of Medical Multiple Agency Task Order (MATO) contracts resulting from competitive Solicitation, N62645-05-R-0009, for the Northeast Medical MATO contracts, anticipated to be awarded in late March 2006. The anticipated performance start date for the competitive MATO contracting effort is 1 June 2006. The National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD and its associated sites: Naval Health Clinic, Patuxent River, MD, Naval Health Clinic, Quantico, VA, and Naval Health Clinic, Annapolis, MD., as well as other Naval Health Care facilities in the Northeastern U.S. and the Naval Hospital, Great Lakes, IL are charged with the mission of providing medical health care for upwards of 500,000 active duty military personnel and their dependents, retired military personnel and their dependents, and other authorized personnel. This mission has a direct effect on the war fighting capability of the United States Navy. In order to meet this mission requirement, the bridge contracts extensions, with the performance period of 1 Feb 06 through 31 May 2006, must be in place NLT 15 Sept 2005 so as to avoid a lapse in services. A lapse in service would have an immediate and detrimental effect on the ability of the Navy to man deployed vessels and to fulfill the Navy’s DOD Operations Plans obligations to provide personnel in forward areas for war fighting, peacekeeping and/or humanitarian efforts.

 PAST PERFORMANCE: Each offeror shall describe their past performance on similar contracts or experience held within the past three (3) years which are of a similar scope, magnitude and complexity to that which is detailed in the request. Past performance shall be evaluated in the following manner: The government will assess the offeror’s ability to perform, including the offeror’s likelihood of achieving success in meeting the contract requirements. The offeror is to provide a written narrative discussion of similar projects of a similar size  and dollar value, which have been successfully completed in the past three (3) years. Contracts listed may be those entered into with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments, and commercial customers. Past performance will be assessed and assigned a narrative rating in the evaluation. The government will evaluate each offeror’s past performance based on the information submitted by the offeror, as well as information that the government collects by itself. Offerors will be given credit for good past performance and lose credit for past poor performance, and neither receive nor lose credit for no past performance data.

The contract will be based on “horse days” depending on cost and funding limitations. This quote should be based on the approximate use of 100 horse days per year. The final contract may be for more or less horse days, depending on funding. A horse day is the cost of one (1) horse per day, not including transportation mileage, until midnight of that day.

An example of estimated usage would be 5 horses for 5 days (25 “horse days”) per month. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL USE ALL HORSE DAYS ALLOWED FOR IN THE CONTRACT due to operational and funding constraints. We will not use the horse(s) a minimum number of days per month.

Horses must be available within a 24 hour notice. Contractor/horses must be within a 30 minute drive, one way, from the Oroville Border Patrol station.

Roundtrip transportation of the horses will be paid from the contractor’s point of origin to wherever specified by the USBP.  Bids should includ cost per mile for transport of 1 to 6 horses. The U.S. Border Patrol may use its own truck(s) and trailer(s) to haul horses. In that case no mileage will be paid.

The contractor will have to provide a detailed invoice on a monthly basis. Invoice processing takes approximately 30 days after it is received at the Indianapolis office. Contractor will usually be notified in August if their contract will be extended for the next year. Note: contract extension into the next physical year (starting Oct 1st) usually result in delayed payments due to congressional constraints. All efforts will be made by this office to process payments as soon as possible. 

The contractor will be required to have a local business license, Federal Tax ID number, obtain a Dunn and Bradstreet number, and register in the governments Central Contract Registration (CCR). This may require direct/electronic deposit of your payments. This will only be required IF YOU ARE AWARDED THE CONTRACT.

The contractor and all employees are subject to a criminal history and background investigation.

 PAST PERFORMANCE: Each offeror shall describe their past performance on similar contracts held within the past three (3) years which are of a similar scope, magnitude and complexity to that which is detailed in the request. Past performance shall be evaluated in the following manner: The government will assess the offeror’s ability to perform, including the offeror’s likelihood of achieving success in meeting the contract requirements. The offeror is to provide a written narrative discussion of similar projects of a similar size  and dollar value, which have been successfully completed in the past three (3) years. Contracts listed may be those entered into with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments, and commercial customers. Past performance will be assessed and assigned a narrative rating in the evaluation. The government will evaluate each offeror’s past performance based on the information submitted by the offeror, as well as information that the government collects by itself. Offerors will be given credit for good past performance and lose credit for past poor performance, and neither receive nor lose credit for no past performance data.

The contract will be based on “horse days” depending on cost and funding limitations. This quote should be based on the approximate use of 100 horse days per year. The final contract may be for more or less horse days, depending on funding. A horse day is the cost of one (1) horse per day, not including transportation mileage, until midnight of that day.

An example of estimated usage would be 5 horses for 5 days (25 “horse days”) per month. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL USE ALL HORSE DAYS ALLOWED FOR IN THE CONTRACT due to operational and funding constraints. We will not use the horse(s) a minimum number of days per month.

Roundtrip transportation of the horses will be paid from the contractor’s point of origin to wherever specified by the USBP.  Bids should included cost per mile for transport of 1 to 6 horses.

The contractor will have to provide a detailed invoice on a monthly basis.  Invoice processing takes approximately 30 days after it is received at the finance office in Indianapolis, IN.

The contractor will be required to have a local business license, Federal Tax ID number, obtain a Dunn and Bradstreet number, and register in the governments Central Contract Registration (CCR). This may require direct/electronic deposit of your payments. This will only be required IF YOU ARE AWARDED THE CONTRACT.

The contractor and all employees are subject to a criminal history and background investigation.

<DESC>This combined/solicitation notice is hereby withdrawn until further notice. 




This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW, the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Price Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-06 & DFARS change notice (DCN) 20051209.

Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 3728, FSC code is 1630& the size standard is 1000 employees. NAICS is 336413.


The Air Force Flight Test Center has a requirement for Wheel Speed and Hubcap Assembly.  The assembly consists of the items as listed:  30 each - P/N 140-285, Wheel Speed Transducer, and 30 each – P/N 140-28530, Hubcap.  The function of the entire assembly is to sense wheel speed at landing to prevent skid on a runway by communicating with an on-board control unit that monitors brake application pressure.  Other salient characteristics are described below:

Two wheel-speed transducers provide individual wheel velocity measurement for each of the braked wheels. The transducers have axle adapters to allow them to be mounted inside the axles.  The transducer-adapter assembly is secured by threaded fasteners protruding through the axle and castellated wheel axle nuts.  The transducer shaft extends from the transducer toward the hubcap.  On the shaft, a drive coupling is installed, which is driven by the hubcap drive mechanism.  The field-proven hubcap-transducer drive interface is of sufficient rotational stiffness and strength to prevent transmission of erroneous wheel-speed velocity signals.  The coupling design can accommodate angular and parallel misalignment and axial assembly tolerance without degradation such as premature bearing or drive coupling wear.  The transducer is a variable reluctance alternator with 36 poles (teeth) on the rotor with 36 matching poles (teeth) on the stator.  The magnetic field is provided by a coaxial coil energized by the control unit transducer bias current.  With the excitation applied, a static magnetic field is established between the north and south poles of the rotor, air gap, stator and return path iron of the transducer, and no output is produced.  As the wheel rotates, rotor teeth pass the stator slots and teeth, causing variations in the reluctance of the magnetic circuit, which causes a change in the flux linking the coil.  The transducer output is, therefore, a sinusoidally varying voltage, with a frequency directly proportional to wheel rotational velocity.

Transducer Weight:  The weight of the wheel-speed transducer is 1.1 pounds.  The weight will be further defined after final axle adapter design.  The transducer weight does not include the weight of the hubcap, which is included in the total system weight estimate.  The proposed wheel-speed transducer is similar to Hydro-Aire 36-tooth wheel-speed transducers used on numerous commercial, business and military aircraft.
See attached specifications for clarification. 

Interested parties who believe they can meet all the requirements for the Wheel Speed and Hubcap Assembly described in this synopsis are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the required equipment.  FOB Destination is the Government preferred method of shipping. Please submit FOB Destination shipping information with all submittals to the office. Delivery Schedule:  Five months ARO. Offerors are required to submit with their quote enough information for the Government to evaluate the minimum requirements detailed in this synopsis.  


52.232-33 Mandatory information for electronic funds transfer payment.  Before we can begin the contracting process with your company, I need the following online Representations & Certifications Application (ORCA) completed--- http://orca.bpn.gov/. for MPIN registration---http://www.ccr.gov/mpin.asp/.  Use of online reps & certs application (ORCA) became mandatory 1 Jan. 2005.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes, standardizes, and moves the collection and storing of FAR level representations and certifications online.  Reps & Certs are to be completed at least annually by vendors online through the ORCA portion of the Business Partner Network (BPN).  Contractors, presently registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), can get a head start by going to www.bpn.gov/orca/ to activate their ORCA profiles.  Initially, ORCA will retain the most significant contractor reps & certs that would apply to any acquisition in the form of 26 questions.  Solicitation specific Reps & Certs may still be used outside of ORCA.  Further information on this initiative may be obtained from the ORCA help menu, http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx.  This help menu includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), and the ORCA handbook.  

Provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors—Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  Provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation, Commercial Items. (JAN 1999).  The government will award a contract resulting form this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government in terms of price and other factors. "Product shall meet the Government's exact specifications (exact form, fit, and function).  It must pass a qualifying test before putting in the C-5 aircraft. In addition, the equipment must be a qualified product ready to be installed in the aircraft."
 
The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the government requirement; (ii) price; (iii) past performance
