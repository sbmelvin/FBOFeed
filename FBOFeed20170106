Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE - INTENT TO AWARD ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS
<p>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(5) and 15 U.S.C. 657(f) (See FAR 6.302-5(b)(6), Sole source awards under the SDVOSB Program and FAR 19.1406, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Program sole source awards). The Army Contracting Command (ACC), Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Research Triangle Park (RTP) Division intends to award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract directly to Trailblazer Innovations, Inc.

<p>The Government has a requirement to support the fielding support, training, and sustainment of Friendly Forces Tracking (FFT) equipment to generate, collect, and disseminate or share friendly force (United States, Allies, and Coalition) identification, location, and tracking information.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall provide architecture design, integration, fabrication and life cycle support of FFT device and systems for Department of Defense (DOD) service components, agencies, and combatant commanders (COCOM). FFT/Blue Force Tracking (BFT) equipment as defined by the CJCSI 3910.01 will generate, collect, and disseminate friendly force identification, location, and tracking information. The required services range from training, to user unique device configuration, architecture integration and data dissemination that is unique to each COCOM. Support is primarily for normal operations but also includes surge support for unforeseen national crises in any theater of operations and Continental United States (CONUS) special security event support that requires coordination in the NORTHCOM Area of Responsibility (AOR). Specialized subject matter expertise is required for the multiple Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) hardware types encountered, the multitude of common operating picture data dissemination architectures available, the complexity of each end user group's concept of operations and is critical to providing the necessary rapid response in support of deploying forces.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals nor does it represent a commitment by Government to pay for any costs incurred by the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this notification.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p><br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Roche Diagnostics, 9115 Hague Road, Indianapolis, IN 46256-1025 to procure the following (BRAND NAME: ROCHE Diagnostics)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procurement:</span></p>
<p>1. SEQCAP EZ EXOME +UTR LIBRARY 48 RXN, Product Number: 06740308011, Quantity: Two.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Institute of Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. NHGRI also supports the training of investigators and the dissemination of genome information to the public and to health professionals.</p>
<p>The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC), established in 1997, is a multi-disciplinary genomics facility that emphasizes the generation and analysis of DNA sequence. In addition to providing investigators at the NIH access to well established, high-throughput DNA sequencing, NISC works closely with NIH collaborators to explore the use and implementation of leading edge genomics technologies, molecular biology protocols and analytical procedures. NISC is a centralized research facility for performing high-throughput, large-scale DNA sequencing and sequence analysis. While it is currently feasible to sequence an entire genome it is quite expensive and unwieldy. A more cost-effective approach is to primarily target only the exons of genes. This method has proven to be an excellent approach to elucidating the critical variants in many rare diseases as well as more common Mendelian diseases.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objective:</span></p>
<p>NISC has been CLIA certified using Roche Diagnostics reagents. CLIA requires NISC to consistently use the same source of reagents. NISC performs exome sequencing on over 2000 samples annually for scientists throughout the NIH and is CLIA certified for exome sequencing. Roche is the sole source for SEQCAP EZ EXOME +UTR LIBRARY reagents and NISC is required to use these reagents in order to comply with CLIA regulations.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a contract to Cobham Advanced Electronic Solutions, Inc., 305 Richardson Road, Lansdale, PA 19446, to modify the current Vertical Polarized (VPOL) Antenna Assembly to the AN/ALQ-99 Low Band Transmitter (LBT). The applicable NAICS Code is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing. The proposed contract will require the development of an engineering change to modify the existing LBT system to improve performance and increase reliability of the highly specialized VPOL Antenna System currently in use and will include the design, manufacture, integration, and test of the VPOL Antenna Assembly. The effort will also require delivery of five test articles to support future qualification and testing of the VPOL Antenna Assembly, as well as applicable technical data. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." As the sole system designer, developer, integrator and manufacturer of the LBT, Cobham has unique expertise regarding the design, engineering and performance details of the LBT and VPOL Antenna that are necessary to redesign the VPOL and to successfully integrate it into the existing LBT Transmitter and AN/ALQ-99 system. The term of the contract is expected to be approximately twelve months. This is not a commercial buy and therefore the Government does not intend to use the provisions of FAR Part 12 for this acquisition. This synopsis is published for informational purposes only. Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities may contact Rebecca Hettel at Cobham via email at rebecca.hettel@cobham.com or at phone number (215) 996-2276.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Navy intends to award a sole source contract modification to contract N00024-12-C-4221 to increase the level of effort on this contract to allow BAE to continue to support the design and development of the pulsed power systems slated to be completed in 2017. BAE will also support battery and container integration and testing efforts and provide the Navy Electromagnetic (EM) Gun Pulsed Power Integrated Product Team (IPT) with analysis, review, modeling, and designs for related pulsed power activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), BAE is the only responsible source capable of fulfilling the Navy's requirements without causing significant delays on the electromagnetic railgun pulsed power system. The technical approaches proposed in an offerors white paper under the BAA are unique to each offeror and not based on performance specifications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, alternate sources for the proposed technology cannot be competed directly as there is no performance specification, technical data package, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work, or a purchase description suitable for full and open competition at this stage of the Research and Development process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The knowledge gained from the developments under this contract will inform the Navy's requirements for future systems should the technology demonstrations prove successful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ultimate shipboard systems will be procured on a competitive basis. Therefore, the technological approach proposed by BAE is proprietary and contains intellectual property unique to this company and the Navy finds they are the only source capable of meeting the requirement without causing a significant delay. The anticipated period of performance for this level of effort increase is 31 December 2018. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. It is a notice that outlines the Navy's intent to contract on a sole source basis with BAE. However, sources may identify their capability to respond to these requirements. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government and that an offeror has the technical capability to fulfill the work without causing a significant delay to the program. Responses must be submitted by email to Ms. Jessie Rehwoldt at jessie.rehwoldt@navy.mil no later than 2:00 pm EST, 21 January 2017. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government and shall be limited to no more than two (2) pages. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. </span></p>

<p><br />Anticipated Issue Date 9 JAN 2017 - Anticipated Closing Date 9 FEB 2017 - 2:00 PM EDT</p>
<p><br />Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division intends to issue a Job Order (JO) under a sole source Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00164-16-G-JQ18. This JO is anticipated to procure spare parts i.e.: tuner and digital receiver for the Common Chassis. The BOA JO is intended to be issued to Sierra Nevada Corporation. Acquisitions under the BOA will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition was the lack of sufficient technical data, restrictive software rights, duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. As a result of this JO the overall contract ceiling for BOA N00164-16-G-JQ18 will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Request for proposal will not be made available through <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">http://www.fbo.gov</a>. The request for proposal will be provided to Sierra Nevada Corporation through electronic mail. The proposed noncompetitive contract action is anticipated to be awarded under FAR part 15, contracting by negotiations. The anticipated contract action award date is 1 Mar 2017. Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Sierra Nevada Corporation, 444 Salomon Circle, Sparks, NV 89434-9651 directly. <br /><br />The point of contact at NSWC Crane is Ms. Vonda Pollock, Code 0231 at telephone 812-854-3683, or e-mail: <a href="mailto:vonda.pollock@navy.mil">vonda.pollock@navy.mil</a>.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:

The NAVSUP Weapon System Support plans to award a five year Performance Based Logistics contract for H-53 components listed below with Sikorsky Aircraft (Cage Code 78266) in Stratford, Connecticut in December 2017.  Under the proposed contract, the contractor will stock, warehouse, repair, modify and/or replace, store and provide for shipment Ready-for-Issue (RFI) condition assets within negotiated supply response times.  The PBL contract will require an integrated product life cycle approach whereby the contractor assumes responsibility for many management and support functions related to the PBL such as engineering and logistics support.  Sikorsky will be required to meet established supply response times through Weapons Replaceable Unit (WRA)/Shop Repairable Unit (SRA) repair and replacement, reliability oversight, and inventory, configuration and obsolescence management.
  The proposed contract will also measure the achievement of Ready Basic Aircraft performance metric improvements.

The contractor will be required to partner with various organic depots such as FRC-E (Cherry Point) in accordance with Title 10 United States Code requirements and to renew and/or execute new Commercial Services Agreements and/or Public-Private Cooperative Agreements.

The maximum period of performance for this effort will not exceed 5 years.  Justification for Sole Source Acquisition: the statutory authority applicable to permit other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) and (iii) with only responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.
  Sikorsky, Cage Code 78286, is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the Navy H-53 components to be covered under this PBL contract.  Sikorsky is the only source with the engineering expertise and technical data necessary to perform essential PBL tasks such as repair, resolution of obsolescence issues, sustainment of reliability, and management of configuration of the Navys Critical Safety Item/Critical Application Item WRAs/SRAs covered by the contemplated procurement.  Further, only Sikorsky owns the necessary design, configuration, manufacturing, production, and process data required to implement the necessary reliability sustainment/improvements.  In addition, only Sikorsky has access to the original design data/OEM intellectual property.
  

Even though the requirement has been designated sole source, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  For any questions concerning this notice, contact the PCO, Megan Kelly at Megan.E.Kelly@navy.mil.

The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items will be solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
  

Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.  

Subcontracting Opportunities: All businesses interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Sikorsky Aircraft.

Lease versus Ownership: 
    TECHNOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Natural Obsolescence Hedge - Perhaps one of the strongest reasons for acquiring equipment through leasing, as opposed to purchasing, is that leasing helps lessees avoid the risk of ownership. A key risk of ownership is that of the equipment obsolescence. Much of today's equipment is based upon technology that is rapidly changing, thus making the equipment subject to obsolescence. The inherent risk of owning technologically-sensitive equipment is that the equipment may become economically useless for the company owning it much earlier than expected and long before the obligations to acquire the equipment have been satisfied. Leasing shifts the ownership risk away from the lessee.

Takeout, Rollovers, and Upgrades - These common lease options give the les-see flexibility during the lease term should the leased equipment become obsolete prior to the termination of the lease. A takeout occurs when a lessor replaces the obsolete equipment with updated equipment, whereby the lessee is "taken out" of the outmoded equipment and then leases the updated equipment. Some-times a lessee may only need an upgrade of its current equipment as opposed to complete replacement. Many lease contracts today are written with upgrade provisions that allow additional equipment to be added to the existing system. 

In summary: 
The reasons for the growing popularity of leasing have been briefly summarized above. The major benefit for the Gulf Coast VAMC facility to lease is to avoid the risks of technological obsolescence; the many options available for upgrades, the benefit of the straight GSA step lease the advantage of the flexible structuring options available that were utilized in the proposed lease. The benefits of leasing to a lessee are numerous and just one of the reasons mentioned above should prove beneficial and motivating to lease rather than to purchase. 
*Leasing shifts the responsibility, risk and hassle of equipment ownership and disposal from us.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey intends to make a non-competitive award to Mount Sopris Instrument Company Inc. located in Denver, Colorado for QL40-ABI-2G ACOUSTIC BOREHOLE IMAGER to be delivered to USGS, 7500 SW 36th street, Davie, FL 33314, within 30 days after receiving award.
There are no option periods.
The Fort Lauderdale office needs this greatly improved second-generation acoustic borehole imager due to its improved signal-to-noise ratio for better results in large diameter mudded borehole, faster logging speed to reduce drill crew down time for logging, and higher image resolution collecting data every 1 degree versus 1.25 degrees with the existing acoustic imager. Most importantly, the QL40-ABI-2G second-generation acoustic borehole imager is the only imager works with our existing Mount Sopris Matrix Logging Systems. This will improve our hydrologic investigations of Florida aquifers as the higher resolution will provide a better image of the borehole wall in mudded holes.
Mount Sopris Instrument Company Inc. is the sole manufacturer of the equipment.
In accordance with FAR 5.207, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency, however, THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
Email responses to hnair@usgs.gov or fax to 703-648-7899.  Emailed responses are preferred.
The NAICS code is 334519.  The size standard is 500 employees.
The anticipated award date of the contract is 01/15/2017.  The anticipated contract will be firm fixed-price.  A vendor must be registered at http://www.sam.gov to be awarded the contract.

JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3.5K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID:
537-17-1-969-0005  
1A. PROJECT/TASK No. 
None
1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

Apollo Anesthesia Workstation

This equipment provides low and minimal inhalation anesthesia to patients during surgical procedures. 

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

The Jesse Brown VA Medical Center currently owns Draeger Anesthesia Care Systems and requires replacement or equipment.  This equipment will be a direct replacement of the outdated equipment that is past service-life.  Purchasing a different system would require the existing OR monitoring network to be modified. Utilizing the identical models of anesthesia equipment would enhance patient safety through operator familiarity as well as maintain the established repair contract that only covers the Draeger Anesthesia System. This is the only equipment that can be customized to meet the facility needs and can be upgraded at any time vs. purchasing all new equipment to keep up with technology.  

4. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:

Market research was conducted on Vet Biz, GSA/FSS websites, NAC Catalog and Fed Biz Ops.  GSA/FSS and NAC Catalog revealed Draeger Medical as the manufacturer and only vendor that holds a FSS contract to supply the requirement.  Fed Biz Ops sources sought revealed two Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses that can supply the brand name equipment.  IAW 13.106-1 - Soliciting Competition this transaction shall be solicited as a brand name only procurement on Government Point of Entry Fed Biz Ops. 

5. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. Note: COs are required to make a determination of price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3.  See the Commercial Supply and Service SOP for Price Reasonableness templates.

<DESC>Overview
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, issues this sources-sought notice as a means of conducting market research to identify interested parties with the resources to manufacture, store, and deliver Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccines. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of future procurement. <em>This is not a solicitation</em>.&nbsp;The applicable NAICS code assigned to this procurement is 325414 with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>FMD is arguably the greatest infectious disease threat to the U.S. livestock industry; even a small outbreak would result in devastating economic and animal health consequences. To ensure the safety of its susceptible livestock, the United States is seeking to improve its FMD vaccine preparedness by enhancing its existing stockpile of FMD vaccine.</p>
<p>There are seven recognized serotypes or strains of FMD: A, O, C, Asia-1, SAT-1, SAT-2, and SAT-3. From these seven serotypes, there are derived multiple subtypes-referred to as topotypes-because they are designated by their geographical point of identification and sometimes year of detection. Regarding vaccination, there is limited cross-protection within a serotype and no practical cross-protection between the seven different serotypes (meaning a vaccine generated against an A serotype will not protect an animal from disease from an O serotype). This complicates vaccine planning because it is difficult for non-endemic countries to anticipate which topotypes from the seven serotypes to stock. This necessitates the development of large and robust vaccine banks.</p>
<p>The current FMD vaccine stockpile for the United States is managed by the North American Foot and Mouth Disease Vaccine Bank (NAFMDVB or Bank). The Bank is a trilateral partnership between the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and the Mexican Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries, and Food. The Chief Veterinary Officers of each country serve as the Bank's Commissioners, who oversee its executive administration. The countries work cooperatively to acquire and manage supplies of FMD vaccine, that are currently stored as a vaccine precursor referred to as vaccine antigen concentrate (VAC), from which the high-potency FMD vaccine is derived. The VAC is apportioned in accordance to the contribution level of each country; but at the time of an outbreak, the Commissioners can reallocate all or a portion of their country's vaccine share to the country(s) experiencing an outbreak within North America and at times, countries of other continents.</p>
<p>Historically, the United States has been aligned with a "stamping-out only" policy which included a "vaccinate to kill" option. Due to this policy, the Bank vaccine stocks had been predicated on a "vaccinate to kill" strategy as part of a greater eradication program. However given the considerable expansion of the livestock production sector since the inception of the policy, the United States determined that the country could not afford to pursue an exclusive "stamping-out only" strategy except in the most limited of outbreaks. In moderate to large-scale outbreaks, such severe actions would place an undue financial and manpower burden on State and Federal regulatory agencies in trying to contain the outbreak; depopulate animals and dispose of tons of carcasses; and could result in the collapse of the domestic animal commodities production sector. So in place of the "stamping-out only" policy, the United States has elected to pursue a "vaccinate to live" policy if the outbreak circumstances warrant this approach.</p>
<p>Requirement</p>
<p>To realign its strategy, the United States is seeking to increase its portion of FMD vaccine Bank holdings and acquire sufficient quantities of VAC or other long-term vaccine precursor storage form(s) to mount a "vaccinate to live" campaign in the United States. These holdings will initially be focused on inactivated products, but novel vaccine platforms or novel processes of generating inactivated vaccine will be considered, provided they meet the performance criteria detailed in this document. While this action would be a U.S.-only acquisition, it would be transacted within the context of the Bank whose other partners may elect to pursue a similar strategy in the future.</p>
<p>Commensurate with this goal, the United States is seeking information from FMD vaccine manufacturers who can meet the objectives and criteria in this document. These broadly include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Possess an extensive FMD virus master seed library to include both current and previously circulating topotypes; and/or, be able to generate a construct equivalent to a master seed (e.g., recombinant virus or genetically altered virus/vector); <br />&bull; Have sufficient resources to quickly generate a master seed (or equivalent construct) when a novel topotype is identified that has no or poor extant vaccine matching;<br />&bull; Manufacture products that have a reasonable expectation to be safe and effective in all target species (i.e., cattle, swine, sheep, and goats);<br />&bull; Supply and maintain high potency vaccine (&ge; 6 PD50 or the equivalent) in the form of VAC or other vaccine precursor storage form(s) in sufficient quantities necessary for a "vaccinate to live" campaign within the United States; and<br />&bull; Possess the capacity to meet U.S. FMD vaccine needs during a prolonged vaccination campaign after the VAC or other long-term storage form(s) is exhausted.</p>
<p>Vaccine Precursor</p>
<p>To meet the needs of a "vaccinate to live" campaign for susceptible U.S. livestock; the amount of vaccine precursor (e.g., VAC) or other long-term storage form(s) apportioned to the United States in the Bank will need to be significantly increased. Requirements are as follows:<br /><br />&bull; Build an inventory of emergency vaccine precursor that would encompass the top ten FMD topotypes posing the highest risk to North America as determined by the NAFMDVB and based on data from the OIE World Reference Laboratory for FMD, The Pirbright Institute; <br />&bull; The minimum amount of vaccine precursor required for such an effort would be approximately 25 million doses per high-risk topotype. As resources permit, this minimum amount should be increased for select high-risk topotypes; lower risk topotypes may be added to the Bank over time (but not necessarily in the same amounts as the high-risk topotypes); <br />&bull; It is important that manufacturers can acquire novel or emerging topotypes that are deemed as high-risk to North America, and be capable of developing a master seed virus or the equivalent in a timely manner so that the product derived from that topotype can be represented in the inventory. Such emerging topotypes would be in addition to the ten high-risk topotypes, and may encompass two to three additional topotypes added to the base high risk ten topotypes or to replace no longer relevant topotypes as needed;<br />&bull; Vaccine precursor would be maintained by the manufacturer for a period of not less than two years from the date of manufacture, and replaced on a predetermined rotational schedule while performing periodic quality assurance assessments to ensure sustained potency with results to be reported to the United States;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Vaccine precursors with prolonged shelf lives beyond two years would be given<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;favorable consideration in a future solicitation; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Manufacturers providing rebates for replacement precursor would be given <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; favorable consideration in a future solicitation; and<br />&bull; The United States seeks to identify vaccine manufacturers who can produce vaccine precursor in these volumes on a reasonable schedule and maintain the vaccine precursor until it is needed.</p>
<p>Finished Vaccine<br /><br />&bull; All finished FMD vaccines must be supplied in the form of high-potency vaccine (&ge; 6 PD50 or an equivalent validated measure of potency);<br />&bull; All eligible FMD vaccines must be either licensed (fully or conditionally) or permitted by the USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) for distribution and sale within the United States; or authorized by the Administrator to be used under the supervision and control of the Department as described in the 9 CFR 106.1 with the condition the manufacturer is actively engaged in the pursuit of obtaining a USDA CVB product license (full or conditional) or permit;<br />&bull; All FMD vaccines to be considered must have a reasonable expectation to be safe and effective in all target species (i.e., cattle, swine, sheep, and goats); <br />&bull; All FMD vaccines must be efficacious when employing a standard vaccination schedule; specifically a priming dose, plus booster (if necessary), with an anticipated duration of protective immunity of &ge; six months; products providing duration of immunity of &gt; six months or convey sufficient immunity for at least six months with only one vaccine dose would be given favorable consideration in a future solicitation;<br />&bull; Acceptable FMD vaccine formulations would include but not limited to inactivated vaccine products; vectored vaccine products; DNA/RNA vaccine products; or any other novel vaccine platform, providing that said platform(s) meets all purity, safety, efficacy, and potency requirements as established by the CVB;<br />&bull; Vectored or nonviable/nonreplicating delivery systems may not be considered if they cannot be used solely in a prolonged vaccination campaign. Specifically, if the vector induces immunity against itself such that successive boostering with that product results in diminishing immunity, then such products may not be viewed favorably unless they provide extraordinary immunity (e.g., long duration, very rapid onset) or act synergistically with other products to provide extraordinary immunity;<br />&bull; The cost-benefit of any product(s) must be equivalent or superior to high-potency (&ge; 6 PD50 or the equivalent) inactivated FMD vaccine, unless that product(s) conveys extraordinary immunity such as rapid onset or unusually long duration of immunity; or the ability to rapidly alter the master seed to match the circulating field virus;<br />&bull; Any eligible FMD vaccine products must be DIVA (differentiate infected from vaccinated animal) compatible using a diagnostic test that is, or can be, validated by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories. This DIVA test must be capable of being conducted using conventional laboratory instruments that would be available in a modern veterinary diagnostic laboratory;<br />&bull; FMD vaccines capable of multivalent antigen formulation and delivery using a single common adjuvant (if necessary) would receive favorable consideration; specifically, USDA seeks to purchase those product lines where multiple topotypes can be combined into a single vaccine formulation with a compatible adjuvant where necessary; and<br />&bull; Vaccines that may be given by multiple delivery systems (e.g., needle-free devices) or by multiple routes of administration (e.g., intramuscularly, subcutaneously, orally) would be given special consideration.</p>
<p>Pre-Outbreak Finished Vaccine Supplies</p>
<p>In the future, the United States may also stock an amount of finished vaccine derived from the high-risk topotypes for launching an immediate vaccination campaign. Therefore, the United States is seeking vaccine manufacturers who can produce and maintain a supply of finished high-potency vaccine with an extended shelf-life.</p>
<p>Requirements for Manufacturer</p>
<p>&bull; Eligible manufacturers should possess and maintain a comprehensive master seed virus collection (inactivated products) and demonstrate the capacity to efficiently isolate and produce a master seed virus; or develop and maintain a library of genomic constructs (vectored products);<br />&bull; All eligible manufacturers must be inspected by the CVB and have met the criteria for an Approved Manufacturing Facility;<br />&bull; Manufacturers who offer vaccines that exhibit epitopic dominance supported by experimental data (broad protection within serotype) will be given preference;<br />&bull; Favorable consideration would be given to those manufacturers who have the flexibility and manufacturing capacity to:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Dedicate manufacturing lines to United States vaccine production at the time of <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an outbreak;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Demonstrate sufficient surge capacity for the production of FMD vaccine&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commensurate with anticipated U.S.&nbsp;operational needs;<br />&bull; When responding to this request for information, manufacturers should indicate their current capacity and delivery schedule to supply the estimated amount of vaccine precursor and conventional finished vaccine listed here:<br /><br />*Precursor Estimate*<br />Number of Topotypes is 10<br />(For this calculation, use<br />the 10 most common topotypes<br />and with all serotypes<br />represented except SAT3.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Conventional Vaccine Estimate*<br /><br />Qty of Vaccine Precursor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doses/week (mono/equivalent)<br />1. 500 million (50m per type)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.5 million/week<br />2. 350 million (35m per type)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 million/week<br />3. 250 million (25m per type)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 500,000/week<br />4. 150 million (15m per type)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 250,000/week</p>
<p>&bull; Manufacturers may also provide projected production capacities and delivery schedules if capital investments are aimed at improving such capacity within the next three to five years;<br />&bull; Should the vaccine precursor (e.g., VAC) be exhausted, the United States needs to ensure that an ongoing supply of conventional high-potency FMD vaccine (not produced from vaccine precursor) is available to continue the vaccination campaign:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o This supply of vaccine may range from 0.5 to 1 million doses of vaccine per week<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for an extended period. Therefore, the United States is seeking vaccine <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manufacturers who possess the surge capacity for conventional high-potency FMD <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vaccine production to address the needs of an ongoing large-scale U.S. FMD <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outbreak;<br />&bull; Favorable consideration would be given to those manufacturers who facilitate the transition from traditional inactivated products to superior vaccine platforms as they become available and are validated;<br />&bull; Manufacturers must have the physical facilities (including cryogenic storage, if required, and monitoring capacity) sufficient to maintain the amount of vaccine precursor that is anticipated to be needed by the United States (approximately 250-500 million doses); and<br />&bull; The manufacturer would supply samples of Master Cell Stocks, Master Seed Virus, Challenge Virus, VAC samples, pilot vaccines (e.g., small serials of finished vaccine that are used to demonstrate efficacy and stability of the VAC) and antisera upon request for independent quality assurance assessment and further testing by USDA laboratories.</p>

<DESC>TNT and PBXN9 Supplementary Charges Market Research
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Rock Island, Rock Island, IL on behalf of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (PM CAS), is conducting market research to identify potential sources to produce, manufacture, assemble, inspect, test, package and ship TNT (NSN: 1320-00-824-0811) and PBXN-9 (NSN: 1320-01-583-1139) Supplementary Charges.</p>
<p>Item Description: The following item description describes both Supplementary Charges in sufficient detail to respond to this sources sought.<br /><br />The TNT and PBXN-9 Supplementary Charges are used in the explosive train of artillery projectiles as a booster between the fuze and main charge. These Supplemental Charges are critical components to the entire family of 105mm and 155mm ammunition that support training and operation requirements in theater. Without Supplemental Charges, TNT loaded projectiles would not detonate high order. Supplemental Charges are placed in the fuze well of all high explosive deep cavity rounds.</p>
<p>The TNT supplementary charges inserted in the 105mm M1 and 155mm M795 consist of approximately 0.33 lbs. of pressed TNT pellets in an aluminum body cup. The PBXN-9 supplementary charges consist of approximately 0.33 lbs. of a pressed PBXN-9 pellet and aid in the detonation of the insensitive explosive filler in an artillery round upon activation by a fuze. The PBXN-9 is placed in the fuze well of rounds filled with an insensitive munition (IM) explosive fill. The PBXN-9 supplementary charges consist of pressed PBXN-9 pellets in an aluminum body cup.</p>
<p>Requirements: The potential production requirement, subject to change, shall be satisfied with award of multiple Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with five (5) ordering periods to cover FY18-FY22 U.S. Army, Marine Corps (USMC), and Foreign Military Sale (FMS) requirements. The combined estimated maximum quantity for all contracts awarded for the TNT is 1,207,500 and the combined estimated maximum quantity for the PBXN-9 is 1,339,844 for all five ordering periods. This requirement will be restricted to the National Technology and Industrial Base (United States and Canada) under 10 USC 2304(C)(3).</p>
<p>The Technical Data Packages (TDPs) will be available six months prior to the release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) for informational purposes only, which is anticipated in 4QFY17.</p>

If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate that they can obtain such, necessary to fabricate, assemble and inspect the required quantities of Supplementary charges and obtain the necessary equipment, facilities and tooling required to fabricate and deliver at a high rate of production. This may include an indication of willingness to invest in setting up a required production line.</p>
<p>Interested contractors should submit the following information:</p>
<p>a. Name of Company, address and CAGE Code<br />b. Points of Contract, name, telephone number, and email address<br />c. Business size information <br />d. Location of the facility or proposed facility<br />e. Manufacturing experience directly related to the TNT and PBXN9 Supplementary Charge or similar items within the last 10 years.<br />f. Summary of their company's capabilities including parent organizations, name/address/point of contact identification, capabilities;<br />g. A description of facilities/equipment, manufacturing processes, inspection capability, personnel<br />h.

<CONTACT>Jerry D. Varnell, Contracting Officer, Phone 7036327500, Fax 7036328480, Email jerry.varnell@ic.fbi.gov
<DESC><strong><br />Request for Information (RFI): Noritsu Service and Maintenance Requirement</strong> <br /><br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issues this Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research for information and planning purposes to determine the existing market/industry capability to provide service and maintenance for Noritsu printers (see requirements section for models and quantities). The Government intends to award a maintenance and service contract under a separate solicitation, but with this notice, hopes to obtain capabilities, delivery, or other market information for planning purposes. All interested, capable, and responsible entities are encouraged to submit a response to this notice in accordance with the below instructions. <br /><br /><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong>
<p><br />The Laboratory Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has a requirement to service and maintain high-quality Noritsu printing equipment. Responses to this RFI will be used to formulate final requirements for repairing and maintaining Noritsu wet and dry printers and to identify qualified service contractors capable of meeting those requirements. The description below outlines preliminary requirements for servicing original equipment. The information gathered will be used to formulate final requirements, and will subsequently be posted in a solicitation for competitive bids.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGOUND</strong></p>
<p>The Latent Print Unit (LPU) and Forensic Imaging Unit (FIU) require the ability to print high quality images used in the manual comparison of forensic images (friction ridge detail that can include pores and ridge edges of latent prints) that are natural size. The LPU has determined that the current Noritsu printers provide the required imaging resolution to be able to manually compare friction ridges that are viewed in natural size and under four- to five-times magnification. LPU is responsible for developing and comparing friction ridge impressions developed from evidence collected from criminal activities and terrorist events. Due to the high standards required for examination and legal testimony needed in reporting the results of LPU analysis, the original specifications and quality of printing must be continually maintained.</p>
<p>The Noritsu printers are located in LPU/FIU space in the FBI Laboratory Building, Marine Corp Base (MCB), Quantico, Virginia, 22134. The normal working hours for use are from 6:00 am through 6:00 pm weekdays, however, availability for use 24/7, is needed.</p>

<DESC><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE: Indian Health Service</strong> - Implementing Purchased Referred Care Rates for Non-Hospital Medical Services<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION &amp; PURPOSE<br /><br /></span><strong>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice</strong>. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND<br /><br /></span>The Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for providing federal health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN).  IHS provides a comprehensive health service delivery system for approximately 1.9 million AI/AN who belong to 567 federally recognized tribes in 36 states.  The Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) Program plays a major role in the IHS provision of care.  Under the PRC program, primary and specialty health care services that are not available at IHS or tribal facilities are purchased from private health care providers.
<p>This request is made in accordance with final rule 42 CFR Part 136, RIN 0917-AA12, "Payment for Physician and Other Health Care Professional Services Purchased by Indian Health Programs and Medical Charges Associated with Non-Hospital-Based Care".  The final regulation was published in the Federal Register on March 21, 2016, with an effective date of May 20, 2016, and a final implementation date of March 21, 2017.  The rule amends the regulation at 42 CFR Part 136 subpart D, and adds a new subpart I "Payment for provider and supplier services purchased by Indian health programs" to apply the Medicare payment methodologies to all physician and other health professional services and non-hospital-based services purchased by an IHS or Tribal PRC program, or urban Indian organization (I/T/U) authorized to receive these services.  It allows these programs to negotiate or pay non-I/T/U providers based on the applicable Medicare fee schedule, prospective payment system, Medicare Rate, Medicare waiver or most favored customer rate.</p>
<p>The IHS contracts the services of a certified fiscal intermediary (FI) agent to provide a centralized medical and dental claims processing service, maintain reimbursement and reporting systems as well as calculate payment rates in accordance with MLR regulations, PRC rule and the IHS payment policy.</p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to identify a potential trainer(s) to provide education and support for Tribal PRC program staff on implementing most favored customer (MFC) rates and computing PRC Rates for non-hospital medical services based on the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Part B payment systems: "Data Entry and Calculations" under the Inpatient Physicians Payment System (IPPS), and PC Pricer pricing methodologies in estimating charges for purchase order obligations on behalf of the health care providers and suppliers within the PRC program.  Estimating charges for purchase orders ensures critical PRC budgets and spending plans reflect a close estimate of actual funds to maintain a consistent level of services throughout the year.</p>
<p>The PRC Rates rule allows the amount negotiated by a repricing agent; or the provider or supplier's MFC.  In the event that a Medicare rate does not exist for an authorized item or service, and no other payment methodology provided by the rule is applicable, the rule authorizes payment at 65% of authorized charges.  Paying at the Medicare rates allows the PRC program to purchase more health care for AI/AN patients.  The use of Medicare rates is necessary to coordinate patient benefits and process medical and dental claims, to ensure that the PRC program is the payor of last resort for services provided to patients and calculate Medicare rates in accordance with the PRC Rates regulations and the IHS payment policy.</p>
<p>These services are also made available to tribes that contract and compact their PRC programs under the Indian Self-Determination Education and Assistance Act (P.L. 93-638). This final rule establishes reimbursements that are consistent across Federal health care programs and aligns payment with inpatient services, and enables the I/T/U to expand beneficiary and access to medical care.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROJECT REQUIREMENT</span></strong></p>
<p>The trainer will be expected to understand the mission of the IHS and its health care delivery system as well as the purpose and function of the PRC Program and the new PRC Rates regulation.  The trainer must have a basic understanding of the IHS Financial Management System that interfaces claims through the IHS Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) and Purchased Referred Care/Management Information System (PRC/MIS) as well as tribal financial management systems.</p>
<p>The RPMS system is a decentralized integrated solution for management of both clinical and administrative information in the IHS healthcare facilities.  RPMS software applications have been, and continue to be, customized and enhanced based on input from users throughout the entire Indian Healthcare system.</p>
<p>Claims Processing System:  Must have knowledge of the CMS Part B payment systems, compute charges using "Data Entry and Calculation for IPPS" and commercial PC Pricers and be able to determine the reimbursement rates for all the different fee schedules, but not limited to the following:</p>
<p>- CMS Medicare Pricer <br />- Provider Carrier/Locality Code<br />- Medicare Fee Schedule (MFS) Pricer<br />- Anesthesia Base Units<br />- CMS Ambulance Fee Schedule<br />- End Stage Renal Dialysis (ESRD) Pricer<br />- Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) &amp; Wage Index File<br />- Physician's fee schedule<br />- Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) fee schedule<br />- Drug fee schedule<br />- Lab fee schedule<br />- Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS)<br />- Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS)<br />- Outpatient Code Editor (OCE)<br />- Hospital Outpatient PPS <br />- National Correct Coding Initiative Edits <br />- Outpatient PPS Pricer Code <br />- National Technical Information Service (NTIS) <br />- ICD-10 Coding Basics <br />- Transmittals</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this requirement is to procure one NMR Spectrometer. The Picospin 80 NMR will allow for high throughput analysis of chemical synthesis products by having the ability to directly inject samples without the need for preparing and transporting samples including unstable compounds that are readily degraded.<br /><br />
<p>The Picospin 80 is a compact size so we will have flexibility in placement of the instrument. A common problem in chemical synthesis is variable qualities of commercially available reagents.  This can be reduced significantly by having the ability to directly inject many reagents in the Picospin 80 Series II NMR for fast analysis at the benchtop immediately before proceeding with reaction set up.  The Picospin 80 Series II NMR spectrometer offers simplified workflows, a modern interface and automatic shimming plus custom methods; perfect for novice or experienced users alike. It enables students and technicians with limited NMR experience to use the power of NMR spectroscopy to identify chemical compounds or elucidate their structure. The instrument's fluid capillary system is contained within a replaceable cartridge and only requires 40 microliters of a liquid sample. Its temperature-controlled permanent magnet does not require cryogens, eliminating the need for consumables or custom laboratory facilities.</p>

<p><strong>1. Solicitation Number: HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-SBSS-17-144</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Title: 5050 Small Molecule for screening library</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Classification Code: 68 - Chemicals</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. NAICS Code: 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services </strong></p>
<p><strong>Description: <br /></strong>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>Background: <br /></strong>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.<br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which mission it is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.<br />Screening is often the starting point in our development and a wealth of knowledge is obtained from screening a diverse collection. It provides the starting point of all information for medicinal chemistry's structure-activity relationship (SAR) design to synthesize novel compounds that have more desirable properties. A diverse and novel screening collection provides the backbone of our operation and is imperative for translation sciences to obtain effective small molecules with on-target effects.<br />These small molecules have been designed around analysis of available chemical and biological information, identification of key pathways modules/targets, computational and "wet biology" assessment of target druggability and potential binding domains. The resulting information is analyzed by synthetic and medicinal chemistry teams in order to bring new chemical diversity and to design unique scaffolds that are likely to interact with the designated targets yielding focused compound libraries. Having such small molecules will make a huge impact in our screening against the variety of targets that NCATS works on and will also help tremendously in bioinformatics analysis which will allow a more thorough and effective SAR expansion by the medicinal chemist.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives: <br /></strong>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure 5,050 small molecules to be included in our screening libraries. Adding diversity to chemical libraries is imperative to our operation, as we screen a variety of targets against these in-house collections.</p>
<p><strong>Project requirements: <br /></strong>Vendor is responsible for providing the following:<br />1. The Contractor must be able to provide the NCATS DPI with 1 mg each of 1,400 and 2 x 1mg each of 3,650 small molecules<br />2. The Contractor must be able to provide small molecules that have been designed around analysis of available chemical and biological information, identification of key pathways modules/targets, computational and "wet biology" assessment of target druggability and potential binding domains.<br />3. Each small molecule must be guaranteed to have a purity of &gt;85% that is to be confirmed by HPLC/ELSD or HPLC/UV or NMR<br />4. The contractor must confirm identity of all compounds by MS and/or NMR. <br />5. PLEASE NOTE: Molecules shall be provided to the NCATS in barcoded vials that shall be provided to the successful Contractor by the NCATS at time of award.<br />6. In addition to the molecules themselves, the Contractor must be able to provide the following electronic information for each required molecule: chemical structure, compound name, molecular weight, simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) or equivalent chemical structure information, accurate weight of amount of compound shipped. This information shall be provided via email referencing individual compound vial barcodes.<br />7. The contractor must provide for shipping and handling to send small molecules in the provided vials to the NCATS.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Contract Type:</strong><br />A firm fixed price purchase order within the Simplified Acquisition threshold is anticipated.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance/Delivery Requirements:<br /></strong>This will be a one-time delivery within 4 weeks upon receipt of barcoded vials. NCATS is responsible for shipping barcoded vials to vendor within 2 weeks from anticipated award date of February 17, 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statement:</strong><br />Contractors that believe that they possess the ability to deliver on the required 5050 Small Molecules should submit documentation on their ability to meet each of the project requirements to the Contract Specialist. Interested organizations must demonstrate and document in any response submitted, to this market survey extensive experience with and the ability to perform all of the specialized requirements elsewhere described.</p>
<p>The information submitted must be in an outline format that addresses each of the elements of the project requirement and in the capability statement/information sought paragraphs stated herein. A cover page and an executive summary may be included but is not required.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE:
NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Philadelphia is interested in developing sources for a five year Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract.  Efforts under this contract will include stocking, warehouse, repair, modification and/or replacement, storage, and providing of Ready-for-Issue condition assets for those components included within this document.  The PBL contract will require an integrated product life cycle approach whereby the contractor will assume responsibility for the management and support functions related to the PBL such as engineering and logistics support.  The PBL contractor will be required to meet established supply response times through Weapons Replaceable Assembly (WRA)/Shop Repairable Assembly (SRA) repair and replacement, reliability oversight, and inventory, configuration, and obsolescence management.
The contractor will be required to partner with organic depots such as FRC-E (Cherry Point) in accordance with Title 10 United States Code and to renew and/or execute new Commercial Service Agreements and/or Public-Private Cooperative Arrangements.
As noted in the Synopsis of this requirement, currently, absent interest by/approval of additional sources, the Government intends to negotiate a contract for this effort with the only approved source, Sikorsky Aircraft in Stratford Connecticut, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
  Specifically, the Government intends to award a Performance Based Logistics contract in support of the attached NIINs in support of the H-53 aircraft.  It should be noted by potential interested sources the Government does not have the rights to, and thus cannot provide access to proprietary technical data/drawings that may be required for manufacture or repair of these components. It should also be noted that because the items on this procurement include Critical Safety Items (CSI) and Critical Application Items (CAI), interested sources must obtain Navy source approval in order to be eligible for award.     
While interested sources are invited to submit a source approval request, due to the Fleets need for the subject effort, the time required for approval of a new source is normally such that the contemplated award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
  Submission of a source approval request, however, may enable an interested firm to become an approved source for a future procurement; it is expected there will be an ongoing need for this type of effort while the H-53 aircraft remains in service. 
For information or questions regarding this notice, please contact Ms. Megan Kelly, by email at Megan.E.Kelly@navy.mil or phone (215) 697-2533.

<p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) John A. Volpe, National Transportation System Center (Volpe Center), is seeking information from motorcycle manufacturers and other stakeholders on their interest in collaborating with the US DOT to explore the potential establishment, by stakeholders, of a Motorcycle Safety Research Consortium (MSRC).</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the USDOT is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.<br /><br />2.0 Background</p>
<p>In 2012, 4,957 motorcyclists were killed in motor vehicle traffic crashes-an increase of 7 percent from the 4,630 motorcyclists killed in 2011. There were 93,000 motorcyclists injured during 2012, a 15-percent increase from 81,000 in 2011. This increase includes all types of crashes; however, 2,624 of all 2012 motorcycles crashes (52%) involved fatal crashes that were the result of collisions with another type of motor vehicle in transport. In two-vehicle crashes, 75 percent of the motorcycles involved in motor vehicle traffic crashes collided with the vehicles in front of them. Only 7 percent were struck in the rear. These two-vehicle crashes may be addressable using advanced crash-avoidance technology.<br /><br />If established, the MSRC would draw on the success of a similar government-industry collaboration for automobile manufacturers (the Crash Avoidance Metrics Partnership), but would reflect the unique nature of the motorcycle industry, its customers, and its advocates.<br /><br />The initial vision for the MSRC is to support pre-competitive technical research and collaborative policy investigations on how various crash-avoidance technologies could be applied to motorcycles. Some of the activities we hope to undertake collaboratively with the members of the consortium include:</p>
<p>&bull; Reviewing and revising National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) draft research plan on motorcycle safety communications<br />&bull; Defining motorcycle pre-crash scenarios that can be addressed by technologies <br />&bull; Developing initial motorcycle crash avoidance and mitigation safety applications based on light vehicle safety applications, but taking into account motorcycle operational dynamics <br />&bull; Creating a motorcycle device development, installation, and testing plan<br />&bull; Developing performance requirements and validation test procedures<br />&bull; Testing and evaluating the operation of motorcycle crash avoidance and mitigation safety applications<br />&bull; Projecting potential safety benefits of motorcycle crash avoidance and mitigation safety applications<br />&bull; Identifying simulator and testing needs in relation to supporting motorcycle driver/passenger alert interface research<br />&bull; Conducting an initial study on various motorcycle operational practices, and laws that may be impacted or impact crash avoidance effectiveness<br />&bull; Discussing potential ways of organizing a motorcycle safety research consortium, and determining which approaches would be most beneficial to all parties</p>
<p>This RFI is only for activities related to exploring the establishment of a Motorcycle Safety Research Consortium. The USDOT believes the basic tenets to establishing this collaborative relationship include:</p>
<p>&bull; An organizational structure or structures that can support industry and other groups collectively working with the USDOT to conduct research on both pre-competitive technical and collective cross-cutting policy issues.<br />&bull; The working nature of this relationship must be beneficial to all parties involved.<br />&bull; Whatever is established must support/facilitate active participation of all parties that want to participate.<br />&bull; All primary parties that want to participate will be expected to share at some level the cost of conducting the collaborative research.<br />&bull; The organizational structure or structures need to be able to support entering into research contracts/agreements with the USDOT.</p>
<p>As part of the exploratory process, the USDOT plans to hold a series of stakeholder meetings to discuss ideas regarding the establishment of a motorcycle consortium for pre-competitive motorcycle crash-avoidance research.<br /><br />3.0 Submission Instructions</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.</p>
<p>Parties interested in participating in exploring the potential establishment of a motorcycle safety research consortium are requested to respond to this RFI with a letter providing contact information, including phone number and email. The deadline for submitting letters of interest is January 23, 2017. Please respond to the following:<br />1. How is your organization related to the motorcycle industry (e.g., manufacturer, supplier, technology developer, technical consultant, advocacy group)?<br />2. Why is your organization potentially interested in participating in the Motorcycle Safety Research Consortium? Are there aspects of the proposed research that are of particular interest to your organization?<br />3. Are there aspects of the proposed research with which your organization already has experience?<br />4. Are there additional research topics, not listed in this RFI, that your organization feels are important?<br />5. In addition to motorcycle manufacturers and related industry stakeholders, what other stakeholders should potentially be included in the Motorcycle Safety Research Consortium?<br />6. In your view, what are the key factors for ensuring a successful Motorcycle Safety Research Consortium?</p>
<p>Response to this RFI should include the following: 1) Response to the six questions clearly listed by number. 2) Summary of your company's capabilities to perform the tasks/activities envisioned by the MSRC. 3) Listing of past work experience including, Company Name, POC, and phone number.<br /><br />Capability summary shall be limited to a total of 5 pages.<br /><br />Please submit letters of interest to Carl Chin, Contract Specialist at: carl.chin@dot.gov.<br /><br />4.0 Information Availability</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This announcement seeks information from industry, which will be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS NOTICE. This is for Market Research only. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this notice. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, requests capability statements from all qualified businesses concerning the potential project described below. Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.
<p>Description/Scope of Work<br />The solicitation will be for a Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery contract and it will be advertised as a Full and Open Competition Request for Proposal (RFP) in the $15M - $18M range (total ceiling). The expected total ordering of all task orders is in the $5M - $7M range. The work includes industrial cleaning of Clearwells, solids handling and disposal services at multiple locations in Washington, DC, NW. Specific work items include power washing the interior of concrete water storage tanks, collection, dewatering, and disposal of lime sediments, chemical application for disinfection and dechlorination of water, and the furnishing and operation of pumps and temporary generators.</p>
<p>The Washington Aqueduct provides potable water to approximately one million people in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia. As part of the water treatment and supply system, the Washington Aqueduct maintains seven (07) underground storage tanks at its Water Treatment Plants and at various pressure zones within the city. The tanks are important components of the water supply system. The intent is to clean 2-3 of these tanks per year, though due to unforeseen circumstances we may clean more or less than that number, and may clean any tank at any time. The scheduling of service outages to accommodate the cleaning may be on short notice, and the duration of such outages constrained. Hence, an experienced contractor with resources and expertise to handle the following project constraints is needed:<br /><br />i. The capacity of the reservoirs to be cleaned, are between 15 million gallons and 30 million gallons, with anticipated settled solids volumes of 100-1000 in-place cubic yards. The average out of service duration for<br />completion of the cleaning work is 8 weeks.<br /><br />ii. The reservoirs are underground concrete structure with limited access, and some are equipped with baffling walls. The Contractor is responsible for all lighting, ventilation, and confined space entry procedures.<br /><br />iii. The reservoir may or may not have gravity drains, and should be presumed to contain some volume of residual water due to sloping and contours of the floor and leakage through isolation gates. The Contractor shall be responsible for pumping to remove any remaining water to allow for the cleaning.<br /><br />iv. The reservoirs are used to store treated and potable water so all materials used therein shall be NSF 61 approved. No equipment that uses hydraulic oil or other contaminant can be used in the reservoir. <br /><br />v. The reservoirs are subsurface structures some of which are located in residential neighborhoods where there is limited space for storage and staging outside of the reservoir. Access openings into these reservoirs limited and the live load that can be placed on each reservoir roof slab is limited.<br /><br />NAICS Code: 221310<br />Product Service Code: S114<br /><br />Interested qualified firms should submit a concise narrative and specific project examples of similar size and scope that demonstrate their experience.<br /><br />Email responses are preferred.<br /><br />Comments will be shared with the Government and the project design team, but otherwise will be held in strict confidence.<br /><br />Responses must include the Offerors' name, POC phone number, SAM information and email address.<br /><br />Contracting Office Address:<br />USACE District, Baltimore, 10 South Howard Street, Baltimore, MD 21203<br />Place of Performance:<br />Washington Aqueduct, 5900 MacArthur Boulevard, NW, Washington, DC 20016<br />Point of Contact(s):<br />Ian Weiss<br />Ian.Weiss@usace.army.mil<br />(410) 258-1540&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers New York District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 million) construction project:
<p><br />Eisenhower Barracks Renovation/Modernization</p>
<p>Project Description:</p>
<p>The New York District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (District) is preparing plans and specifications for the repair of a 235,040 SF, multi-story cadet barracks building at West Point, NY with a current capacity of 673 Cadets with 320 rooms. The scope of the work entails the repair of the entire Eisenhower Barracks (Building 45C). Building repairs will include repairs to architectural features, mechanical/electrical/plumbing systems, and hazardous building material abatement.</p>
<p>Architectural repairs will address failing condition of walls, floors, ceilings and stairwells. Building exterior and envelope repairs will include repairs to water infiltration systems, structural roof systems, insulation and waterproofing, windows, rooftop equipment screening, and exterior masonry and limestone.</p>
<p>Mechanical/Electrical/Plumbing (MEP) repairs will include fire suppression and water supply systems, fire alarm and mass notification system, fire detection/protection/monitoring/controls, heating and ventilation systems, plumbing systems, electrical systems, telecommunication and cabling systems, closed circuit television (CCTV), alarm and card access systems, public address systems, time clock systems, cable television systems, and distributed antenna systems (DAS).</p>
<p>Hazardous building materials (HAZMAT) including asbestos, lead, radon, and mold are presumed to exist. Repairs will include the abatement of all HAZMAT that is known. It is anticipated that additional unknown HAZMAT will be discovered during repair and will also be abated.</p>
<p>This facility will accommodate 612 Cadets and 16 Tactical Offers and Tactical NCOs, for a total of 306 cadet rooms and 8 TAC/TAC NCOs after the repairs are complete.<br /><br />Repairs will comply with EPAct 2005, EISA 2007, Executive Orders (EO) 13423 and 13514, and other current policies and directives on energy and water conservation. This project will achieve GBCI level certification at the LEED-NC/MR silver level and will follow the guidance detailed in the Sustainable Design and Development Policy.</p>
<p>The anticipated Magnitude of Construction is between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Approximately 600 calendar days after Notice to Proceed. Notice to Proceed is anticipated to occur between October and November 2017.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>a. The project will require multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.</p>
<p>b. There is a shortage of skilled labor in the region.</p>
<p>c. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.</p>
<p>d. PLA's have been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in this geographic area.</p>
<p>e. A PLA will promote the agency's long term program interests, such as training of skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs.<br /><br />Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:</p>
<p>1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Have comparable projects been undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on similar projects? If so, please provide supporting documentation. For each project, please indicate if a PLA was used and, if available, the initial and final cost, number of trades on the project, if the project was completed on time, and if there were any challenges such as labor shortages, labor related delays, safety issues, etc.</p>
<p>2. Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area over $25M, within 50 miles of West Point, NY which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Are existing apprentice programs providing sufficient numbers of skilled workers for future requirements? If so please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>3. Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit from a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? How would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>4. Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement. Are there any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA?</p>
<p>5. Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>6. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve? What market share does union labor in construction trades have in the geographic area? Which existing Collective Bargaining Agreements will expire during construction of this project?</p>
<p>7. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>8. What is the estimated relative cost impact of using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>9. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p>10. Should a PLA be executed on the above described Pershing Barracks project? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the Pershing Barracks project?</p>
<p>11. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>12. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via e-mail to Orlando Nieves, Contract Specialist at Orlando.Nieves@usace.army.mil AND NYDCONTRACTING@USACE.ARMY.MIL no later than close of business on 23 January 2017.</p>
<p>This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.</p>

<SUBJECT>FY17 Maintenance Dredging of Newark Bay, NJ
<SOLNBR>W912DS-17-S-0010
<RESPDATE>020617
<CONTACT>Alex Heinzel, Phone 9177908087, Email alexander.t.heinzel@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The New York District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) proposes to perform maintenance dredging of portions of the Newark Bay, New Jersey, and New York &amp; New Jersey Harbor - Newark Bay, Federal Navigation Projects.  The dredged material would be processed and subsequently transported to and placed at a contractor furnished, State permitted upland placement site(s). The proposed maintenance dredging would remove approximately 280,000 cubic yards (CY) of selected critical shoals from the Main and / or Port Newark Channels of Newark Bay.  Dredging in these channels would be required to a depth of -38 feet and / or -40 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) plus 1 foot allowable overdepth. In addition, approximately 250,000 CY of selected shoals from the Main and / or Port Elizabeth Channels of Newark Bay would be required.  Dredging in these channels would be required to a depth of -50 feet MLLW plus 1 foot allowable overdepth.  A total of approximately 530,000 CY of dredged material (the majority of which is expected to be the basic work, and the remaining quantity would be an option(s)) would be required to be removed. The dredged material is expected to consist primarily of silt and clay.<br /><br />Due to restrictions found in the water quality certificate, the proposed work can only be performed by utilizing a mechanical dredge with a closed clamshell environmental bucket. Additionally, multiple barges and tug boats will be needed to perform the work during the dredging, dewatering and unloading operations. The dredged material would be required to meet all federal, state, and approved local criteria required by the government agencies having jurisdiction where the placement site is located. All necessary permits required for the dredged material placement will be provided by the contractor to the government.<br /><br />The apparent low bidder shall, within 35 calendar days from the date the apparent low bidder is notified of being such, provide copies of all required permits and approvals for transfer, transportation, dewatering and / or other processing, and final placement of dredged material, and shall submit evidence of such permits and approvals to the government.<br /><br />Once the contract is awarded, the contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt by him of the notice to proceed, and maintain an integrated production rate of at least 2,250 cubic yards per calendar day for the dredging, transfer, transportation, dewatering and / or other processing, and final placement of the material.  The presence of dredging equipment in the channel will impact ship traffic, and it is necessary to maintain this production rate while minimizing the duration of this impact.<br /><br />The proposed work is anticipated to take place between July 2017 and February 2018.  The work is estimated to cost between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.<br /><br />The following is a confidential survey questionnaire designed to apprise USACE of prospective dredging contractors' project execution capabilities. Please provide your response to the following questions. All questions are in regard to the Newark Bay maintenance dredging project.<br /><br />General<br /><br />1)	Have you ever worked on dredging jobs similar in nature to this project? If so, please describe the project and for whom the work was performed. Identify a point of contact and phone number, if possible.<br /><br />2)	What percentage of work (volume of material dredged, transported, dewatered processed, and ultimately placed) can you perform with your own equipment or equipment owned by another small dredging contractor?<br /><br />3)	Have you performed dredging within the waters of the Port of New York and New Jersey?<br /><br />4)	Would you be willing to bid on the project previously described? If the answer is No, please explain why not?<br /><br />5)	Would you be bidding on this project as a sole contractor, prime contractor with subcontractor(s) or as a joint venture?<br /><br />6)	Is there a dollar limit on the size contract that you would bid?<br /><br />7)	What is the largest dredging contract, in dollars, on which you were the prime contractor?<br /><br />8)	What is your bonding capacity per contract? What is your total bonding capacity?<br /><br />Equipment<br /><br />9)	What type of dredge equipment do you own and / or operate that is suitable for the work described?  Do you own a closed environmental clamshell bucket?  Please list each piece of equipment capable of performing each type of work described, i.e. dredging, transfer, transportation, dewatering and/or other processing, and final placement of the material.  For each dredge that you list, please specify its bucket size(s), and any other salient characteristics.<br /><br />10)	Identify which dredge(s), including support equipment (tug, scows, etc), you would employ on this project. Also, for each dredge, identify the digging depth.<br /><br />11)	How many material scows do you have available for use? Please list the name of the scow, its type, and the capacity.<br /><br />12)	Do you have experience with the placement of dredged material at upland placement sites?<br /><br />13)	Please list any history with the dredging of non-HARS material. Also list the processing and placement sites used to place the material.

<DESC>Notice Information:<br />This is a Sources Sought/Request for Information only. The submission of this information is for planning purposes only. This is not a Solicitation Announcement, nor is it a Request for Proposal. This request does not obligate the government to make a contract award. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District, is conducting preliminary research to determine the market capabilities of potential contractors to provide for the replacement of the existing failing HVAC systems for the Non-Commissioned Officers Academy (NCOA) Barracks HVAC Repair, Ft. Gordon, GA. This market research will facilitate a determination of the acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government will determine the acquisition type based on the market research and information available from other sources. The market survey is being conducted to determine if there are a reasonable number of large or small business firms interested in performing this work (including socio economic businesses). Small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses are encouraged to respond. Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate decisions. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 236220 Commercial &amp; Institutional Building Construction with a size standard of $36.5M. The FSC Code is Z2FZ - Repair or Alteration of Other Residential Buildings. The duration of project will be approximately 450 days. There will be no optional items of work for this project. The magnitude of construction is between $5M and $10M.
<p><br />Project Description:<br />Project will repair failing HVAC systems, mold and mildew damage, fire protection, flooring, lighting and mechanical systems to bring facility into code compliance. Work will include replacement of failed HVAC systems to correct ventilation, moisture control, and temperature control. Mechanical controls will be fully compatible and controlled by the installation's centrally managed utilities management control system. Provide base wide compatible fire alarm and mass notification systems to meet codes. Project repairs will comply with EPAct 2005, EISA 2007, Executive Order 13423 and 13514, and other current policies and directives on energy and water conservation. The building is a three-story, permanent construction AST Training Barracks built in 1988 and is approximately 37,000 square feet. Each floor has a central hallway with one person rooms that provide a single person living space and two rooms sharing a common latrine. This project is required to correct failed and failing systems in building 24404, specifically HVAC failure with attendant mold, mildew and other moisture damage. Repair to the metal standing seam roof has been the only repair of significance over the life of the building. Otherwise, only basic repairs have been performed since original construction.</p>
<p>This project will provide for the replacement of the existing failing HVAC systems and repairs to and replacement of other systems and finishes including:</p>
<p>(a) Replacement of existing dual temperature piping system with new four (4) pipe chilled water and hot water distribution system.<br />(b) Replacement of HVAC system electrical components.<br />(c) Replacement of HVAC controls.<br />(d) Repair of building envelope and building interior as needed.<br />(e) Replacement of all windows to meet Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection.<br />(f) New wall and flooring finishes.<br />(g) Replacement of all plumbing fixtures.<br />(h) Replacement of light fixtures with LED technology.<br />(i) Upgrade existing fire alarm and mass notification system to meet current UFC requirements.<br />(j) Removal of hazardous materials including Lead Based Paint and Asbestos Containing Material.</p>
<p>The project will repair the following facility systems: (1) Mechanical and Plumbing systems: The existing HVAC systems&nbsp;cannot control humidity. Mold and mildew is developing within the building, rooms and hallways. The hallways were not conditioned, and serviced only by limited return air from the adjacent rooms. This system will be repaired to provide a system that conditions the air and controls humidity levels, serving rooms and hallways to insure balanced conditions. Original piping is cast iron with heavy scale inside the pipes, reducing water flow. Original potable water supply will be repaired as needed to insure sanitary and efficient supply. (2) Architectural: Years of moisture have caused rust and other deterioration to metal interior door frames and wooden doors at each room, requiring repair or replacement of frames and doors, based on level of damage. Damaged and stained ceiling tiles, and grid will be repaired as conditions warrant.<br />Electrical: Existing electrical wiring is inadequate for modern power requirements and requires repair/alterations to prevent power losses and repair potential hazards from moisture deterioration.</p>
<p>Lighting fixtures are inefficient and ballasts are failing due to moisture above the ceiling areas. Lighting will be repaired to provide efficiency and proper illumination as required. If asbestos, lead based paint, bio-hazard or other hazardous materials are found, they will be handled, stored and disposed of in accordance with current Final Governing Standards and laws and regulations. The facility will meet the Standards of "Substantial Life-Safety" upon completion of this project. All required anti-terrorism force protection measures are included</p>
<p>There will be no reimbursement costs associated with providing information in response to this request<br />nor any requests for follow-up information.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Lab7 located in Austin, TX, for the purchase of integration of data output from the DasBox bioreactor instrument into the existing LIMS system created by Lab7.  The system must record metadata about each run, sample, and output, while creating pointers to the data within LIMS so it can be easily found by customers of the Core Facility at the US Meat Animal Research Center in Clay Center, NE. The ESP laboratory information system (LIMS) was designed and customized for USMARC by Lab7, and this new process-based LIMS is only available from them.  The requested modification is to enhance the system to capture data from a new instrument that is a research-focused bioreactor for analyzing bacterial growth and other related parameters, from a recently-procured new DNA sequencing system, to assist in monitoring the data and providing ready access for researchers to the data they requested.  No other vendor has the necessary base code for the ESP to make these enhancements.  The modified LIMS will assist in monitoring the data and provide ready access for researchers to the data they requested.  No other vendor has the necessary base code for the ESP to make these enhancements.  Lab7 is the only vendor authorized to modify the existing system data to incorporate the DasBox because of the proprietary setup.<br /><br />This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive quotations or proposals. No solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide these products are encouraged to identify themselves and provide a substantive statement with descriptive literature and any other supporting information to the Contracting Officer within 10 days of publication of this notice. All information received within 10 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government to determine if the more than one firm can meet the Government's requirements and is capable of performing the intended task(s). All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to the attention of Donita Furman, fax 402-762-4148, or by email to donita.furman@ars.usda.gov. Questions concerning this acquisition must be directed to Donita Furman at 402-7962-4145 or at the above contact information.<br />

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

<p>Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented in FAR Part 6.302-1, the<br />Government needs to modify the MA IDIQ contracts to increase the ceiling to<br />meet all United States Forces Korea (USFK) construction requirements<br />effectively and efficiently, preventing a duplication of effort not<br />expected to be recovered through full and open competition and also prevent unacceptable delays in fulfilling requirements. The initial ceiling was<br />set based on the projected requirements of various requiring activities<br />throughout USFK. However, unforeseen and unanticipated requirements<br />resulted in a quicker exhaustion of the initial ceiling.</p>
<p>The Government intends to solicit for the follow-on contracts around mid-<br />February 2017.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please contact Contracting Officer, Ms. Unhui Ko at unhui.ko.civ@mail.mil , or Contract Specialist Ms. Anna Lee at <a href="mailto:anna.w.lee.civ@mail.mil">anna.w.lee.civ@mail.mil</a>.</p>

This proposed procurement will be a sole source action under North American Industry Classification System(NAICS) code 221112 Electric power generation, fossil fuel (e.g., coal, oil, gas) and the size standard is 750 employees. This proposed action is for the operation and maintenance of two power generators located on Fort Bliss, TX. The awarded contract will have an anticipated period of performance from 03 February 2017 to 01 November 2021 and possibly 6 month extension. The proposed source is Rio Grande Electric Coop. The two generators are owned by RIO Grande Electric and are directly connected to the RGEC Fort Bliss Sub-Station Busses. Since these two utility scale generators are directly connected to RGEC's Distribution Grid, the output must be controlled by RGEC to ensure the safety and integrity of its Distribution Grid and to ensure that the power produced from them does not reverse flow into the El Paso Electric Transmission Grid. Doing so is in direct violation to rules established by the Public Utility Commission of Texas.

<SOLNBR>RFQ-0003208
<RESPDATE>011317
<CONTACT>Kemper Nichole Wood, Email kemper.wood@ic.fbi.gov
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time, sole-source, fixed price contract with Mystaire, Inc., 15113 Dobbyn Creek Road, Creedmoor, NC, 27522-7023 for the purpose of procuring a Super Glue Fuming (SGF) Chamber.
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation uses super glue fumes to develop latent prints. This is accomplished by heating super glue to high temperatures causing the glue to go from a liquid to a vapor state. The vapor adheres to the fingerprint residue left by an individual who has handled an item. This processing method is the most common print development method used by the FBI. A large capacity cyanoacrylate chamber ducted unit with dual hot plates is needed to outfit the new Intake Center located in Huntsville, AL. This chamber is required to process evidence that cannot be brought directly in the Laboratory and will be taken to the Intake Center where it will undergo forensic exploitation to include latent print examination. The large capacity chamber is necessary to ensure that the largest variety of evidence can be accommodated in the facility.</p>
<p>The FBI currently owns large capacity cyanoacrylate chambers ducted units with dual hot plates built and manufactured by Mystaire, Inc. Mystaire builds the large capacity cyanoacrylate chambers in accordance with the custom specifications provided by the FBI which meets the necessary requirements for the FBI to fulfill its mission.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements for the Large Capacity Cyanoacrylate Chamber: <br />&bull; Built in Place<br />&bull; Ducted<br />&bull; Bottom of chamber to be the floor of the building<br />&bull; Threshold to allow for carts to be rolled into the chambers <br />&bull; Purge to be open when the chamber is not in use<br />&bull; Internal dimensions 70"W x 76"H x 46"D<br />&bull; Dual hot plates capable of reaching a temperature of no less than 300&deg;C</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that Mystaire Inc. is the sole provider and manufacturer of the large capacity cyanoacrylate chambers that meet the FBI specifications and owns that patent for this product.</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 339113 Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing.</p>
<p>The FBI intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to the attention of: Kemper Wood, email address: Kemper.Wood@ic.fbi.gov by Friday January, 13 (3:00 pm Eastern). Emailed responses will only be considered. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.</p>

<p><br />The Government is issuing this RFI/Sources Sought Notice announcement as part of market research for a Cyclic Stick Assembly. Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division (NSWCCD) intends to award a sole source contract to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC), 6900 Main Street, Stratford, CT 06614. This effort will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is the lack of Intellectual Property and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source.<br /><br />The Government is seeking potential sources to mitigate the sole-source basis cited above. Companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide components that meet the Government's specifications and qualification requirements for Cyclic Stick Assemblies are invited to submit information pertaining to their capability to fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p>Responses should include availability, budgetary cost estimate, and lead time of the solution, as well as, whether a demonstration unit can be provided to expedite the Government decision-making process.</p>

<p>Responses to the Market Survey shall include the following:</p>
<p>Submitter's Name<br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size<br />Point of Contact (POC)<br />POC Telephone<br />Announcement Number: N00164-17-S-NB38</p>

<p>At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts. This RFI/sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Information shall be submitted to NSWC Crane Contracting POC Mr. David Stephens, via email at <a href="mailto:david.r.stephens@navy.mil">david.r.stephens@navy.mil</a>&nbsp;no later than the date and time noted above.

<p>The United States Air Force (USAF) Test Pilot School (TPS) is a school of applied engineering, at which students learn to apply a multitude of engineering concepts throughout all aspects of flight test.

<DESC>The purpose of this requirement is to procure assurance plans for the equipment used for bioanalytical and proteomic assays. There are many bioanalytical and proteomic assays that are dependent on the proper functioning of the instruments.
<p><br />The LCI group requires the use of these instruments to do bioanalytical and proteomic assays of human plasma samples in the lab - to maintain and prevent breakdowns. If it breaks down and is out of warranty, the cost of repairs would be very high and would require a significant downtime for repairs, which would hamper the research as the assays typically run on these instruments only.</p>

  Sufficient information to determine the date of completion of the project must be included in the project description or the project will not be considered.  If the project submitted was a design-bid-build (full design), then the design must be complete.  If the project was design-build, the design-build construction contract must be complete.  If more than the maximum number of projects is submitted, the Government will not evaluate projects beyond the maximum number specified in the submission requirements and projects will be evaluated in the order in which they are presented within the SF 330.  

All projects provided in the SF 330 must be completed by the office/branch/regional office/individual team member actually proposed to manage and perform work under this contract.
  Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from consideration in the evaluation.  To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF 330 Part I, Section F, block 25, Firm Name Include a contract number or project identification number in block 21.

  If a project was performed by a joint venture, and not all joint venture partners are on the team proposed for this contract, the firm/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner offering/teaming on this contract.  Likewise, if the firm/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the firm/team member proposed for this contract and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole.  If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

NOTE: If the firm is a joint venture, projects performed by the joint venture should be submitted; however, if there are no projects performed by the joint venture, projects must be submitted for each joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of eight projects.
  Firms failing to provide projects from all joint venture partners will be considered to have not met the requirements of the criterion. 

Projects shall be submitted on the SF 330 at Part I, Section F and shall be completed projects.  Projects not completed will be excluded from evaluation consideration.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.  Do not submit an IDIQ contract as an example project.  Instead, list relevant task orders or stand-alone contract awards that fit within the definition above.  The Government will not evaluate information provided for an IDIQ contract.  Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated.
  Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers may result in a firm being considered less qualified.

If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 3 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 3 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the technical evaluation process stops at this point. Contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer, an award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.</p>
<p>If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue (in order by price) until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.</p>
<p>4) USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.</p>
<p>(e) Each Factor will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>Factor 1. Technical Acceptability</p>
<p>Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Rating - Description<br />Acceptable - The quoted product meets all technical criterion stated in the Statement of Work.<br />Unacceptable - The quoted product does not meet all technical criterion stated in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Factor 2. Past Performance</p>
<p>Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Rating - Description<br />Acceptable - Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the quoter's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable - Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that<br />the quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort</p>
<p>Note: In the case of a quoter without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>Note: Quoters are not required or requested to submit past performance references. The Government will use public and Government-restricted sources (e.g. PPIRS) to evaluate past performance.</p>
<p><br />Factor 3. Price</p>
<p>Price will not be rated. Price analysis will be conducted to determine reasonableness.</p>
<p>(x) Quoters are required to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items with its quote. Quoters shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if they have completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) Web site accessed through http://www.acquisition.gov . If the Quoter has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically, it shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (q) of this provision.<br />(xii) The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.

(For further information, the Contracting Officer is a federal government employee who is specifically authorized and appointed in writing under specified agency procedures and granted the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate contracts and make related determinations and findings.) In the event, the Contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in costs incurred as a result thereof. <br /><br />The following Primary Contracting Officer is assigned to this contract. Alternate Contracting Officers may be assigned:</p>
<p>TSA Contracting Officer:<br />NAME: Kevin Newton<br />PHONE NUMBER: 202.631.3110<br />EMAIL: kevin.newton@tsa.dhs.gov</p>

<p>The facsimile number listed above shall be used by contractors for ORIGINAL invoice submission only. If facsimile submission is utilized, contractors shall not submit hard copies of invoices via the U.S. mail. It is the responsibility of the contractor to verify that invoices are received, regardless of the method of submission used.

<p>(f) Supplemental Invoice Documentation: Contractors shall submit all supplemental invoice documentation (e.g. copies of subcontractor invoices, travel vouchers, etc.) necessary to approve an invoice along with the original invoice. The Contractor invoice must contain the information stated in the Prompt Payment Clause in order to be received and processed by FinCen.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-93 effective 01 January 2017.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,250 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopters, Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Messier Dowety (Cage Code F0189) and Airbus Helicopters, Inc. (Cage Code 3GSZ1). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>
<p>See attached documents titled: <br />&#61607; "Requirements - HSCG38-17-Q-200068" and<br />&#61607; "Terms and Conditions - HSCG38-17-Q-200068".</p>

<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS SOLICITATION

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The government anticipates a single (all or none), firm fixed price award.  A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier s quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri">(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 
  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.
  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.

(1)	 A contractor may obtain a DUNS number?

Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing. <BR> <BR>(f)  The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. <BR> <BR>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest.

<p>General. This acquisition is being procured in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers statute (also known as the Brooks Act) as implemented per the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Sub Part 36.6, Sub Part 236.6 of the Defense Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS) and Sub Part 5136.6 of the Army Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS); the USACE Acquisition Instructions (UAI); and Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 Architect-Engineer Contracting in USACE. These IDCs are intended to be solicited, evaluated and awarded applying the requirements and procedures identified in the 40 United States Code (U.S.C) Chapter 11, Public Law 92-582, Selection of Architects and Engineers, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Sub-Part 36.6, 10 U.S. Code 2855, Law Applicable to Contracts for Architectural and Engineering Services and Construction Design, Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7, Architect Engineer Contracting in USACE, DFARS 219.502-1(2), and DFARS 219.502-2(a)(iii).</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one A-E synopsis will be issued for this requirement. In accordance with FAR 19.502-3, the Contracting Officer plans to set-aside a minimum of three IDCs for small businesses. A target of six A-E IDCs, with a shared capacity of $100M, is contemplated for award; however, the Government reserves the right to award more or no contract at all. This strategy is intended to satisfy the requirements of DFARS 219.502-1(2) and DFARS 219.502-2(a)(iii). The resultant contracts will have a 24-month base ordering period and three 12- month optional ordering periods.</p>
<p>The evaluation board will conduct initial evaluations of qualifications for two separate groups: large businesses and small businesses.<br />All firms will be evaluated against the same primary and secondary selection criteria; however, the Small Business Firms will be ranked separately from the Large Business Firms. All members of the selection board must personally evaluate the SF 330's of all of the highly qualified firms. The firms that demonstrate higher aggregate qualifications relevant to the primary selection criteria are considered to be the most highly qualified firms within each group. Sufficient firms must be recommended to ensure that at least two most highly qualified firms within each group remain "in reserve" when negotiations commence on the final contracts. If two or more firms are technically equal, the secondary criteria will be used as "tie-breakers" and the final ranking of firms will be decided after interviews are conducted. After the initial evaluation of qualifications has taken place to determine the most highly qualified firms for each group, a Request for Price Proposal (RFPP) will be issued to the highest rated firms in each group. Negotiations, as necessary, will take place and if negotiations are not successful with any of the highest rated firms, negotiations will be conducted with the next most highly qualified firm(s), and so on.<br />Task orders will be awarded detailing technical requirements, deliverables, and schedules. The A-E contractor(s) shall, upon task order award, perform services to meet the requirements of the order as well as comply with all applicable Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA), Federal, State and Local laws, regulations, agreements, Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) and Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) and policies.</p>
<p>IAW the Service Contract Labor Standards (previously known as the Service Contract Act of 1965) as defined in the FAR 37.101, this will be a service acquisition. A-E acquisitions however are not commercial services in nature and thus will not be procured using FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541310, Architectural Services.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.236-23, Responsibility of the Architect-Engineer Firm, the A-E Firm shall be responsible for the professional quality, technical accuracy, and the coordination of all designs, drawings, specifications, and other services furnished by the Firm under the contract. The Firm shall, without additional compensation, correct or revise any errors or deficiencies in its design, drawings, specifications, and other services. In accordance with DFARS clause 252.236-7009, Option for Supervision and Inspection Services, the Firm may perform any part or all of the supervision and inspection services for the construction contracts resulting from the A-E services, however, the A-E firm will not be responsible for the direct performance of the construction itself. In accordance with FAR 36.209, the A-E Firm and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for DoD construction/design-build contracts that relate to any A-E TOs awarded under this contract. Potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCIs) are also government by FAR Sub Part 9.5.</p>

AMENDMENT # 1 - SFO # VA101-15-R-0022
Charlotte Hall, MD
January 06, 2017


PART I BASIC SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS

SECTION 1.5 OFFER DUE This section has been deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

Offers are due by February 15, 2017, 4:00 PM Eastern Time (ET), and must remain open until award.  VA currently anticipates award on or before Winter 2018.  Offers must remain open, and pricing must remain valid 60 calendar days from the date of award.

A preproposal conference has been scheduled for Wednesday, January 18, 2017 at 1:00 PM ET at the Washington DC VAMC, 50 Irving ST NW, Washington DC 20422 in Conference Room 1B-105 in the Executive Suite. Interested parties will be responsible to submit initial questions to be addressed at the preproposal conference by January 9, 2017. 

Attendance at the preproposal conference is encouraged, but not required to submit an offer in response to the solicitation. 

After, the preproposal conference interested parties may submit any remaining questions in writing via email to the Contracting Officer, and copy ISI Professional Services at the contact information provided in paragraph 1.7 below. The final due time and date for questions submissions is 4:00PM Eastern on January 23, 2017.


PART 9 CONCEPTUAL PLANS   This section has been amended to include the following file:

Filename:  Charlotte Hall RVT.zip

Below please find a link to the Revit files for the Charlotte Hall, MD procurement:
https://isiwdc.sharepoint.com/extsharing/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?folderid=182e66351e885447aa4976fbb1dc51d10&authkey=AYNoSr0IU3776uZOBDmexHA&expiration=2017-03-07T14:59:56.000Z


Questions and Answers:

The pre-proposal conference date (Jan 10), questions due date (Jan 16), offer due date (Feb 1) appears to be really short. As many inside and outside of government are out for the holidays, use or lose vacation time, etc., business production is highly impeded until after the MLK holiday (Jan 16) and the inauguration (Jan 20). Can the pre-proposal conference date, questions due date be postponed by two weeks and theoffer due date be extended to March 1, 2017?

Answer: See Amendment #1

Is the anticipated award date Winter (12/21) of 2017 or 2018?

Answer: The anticipated award date is Winter 2018.

Has the NAICS Code changed again, and the small business size reduced?
The Sources Sought Notice from the October 20, 2016 posting stated that  This modified Sources Sought Notice changes the NAICS code from  The NAICS Code is 531190 Lessors of Other Real Estate Property, and the small business size standard is $38.5 million.  To  The NAICS Code is 531120   Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings (except Miniwarehouses), and the size standard is $38.5 million.   Additionally, the response date has changed to October 26, 2016. Firms, who already submitted capabilities statements including reports from SAM.gov showing size status under NAICS 531190 and NAICS 531120, do not have to resubmit. All interested parties, including Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Veteran Owned Small Businesses, all other Small Businesses, and other than small businesses, who are capable of meeting the requirements are encouraged to submit capabilities statements for market research purposes.;
 
The SFO states that the  NAICS Code is 531120 and the size standard is $38.5 million . However, the SFO 3518 states  (1) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 531190. (2) The small business size standard is $20.5 Million in annual average gross revenue of the concern for the last 3 fiscal years .

Answer: Per SFO Sections 2.4.4 and 10.4, for the purposes of this solicitation and resultant contract (lease), North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes is 531120 - Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings (except Miniwarehouses). The small business size standard is $38.5 million. Under this classification, a concern is considered a small business if its average annual receipts for its preceding three (3) fiscal years do not exceed the size standard reflected. Prime and Joint Ventures submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation must meet the small business size standard.

This also appears to be a Small Business set aside.  However, the  rule of two  suggests that this should be a SDVOSB/VOSB set aside.  Could you please clarify this?

Answer: This is a Small Business Set-Aside procurement.  

I would like to postpone the pre-proposal conference. If that cannot happen, is there a call-in number?

Answer: There is not a call-in number for pre-proposal conference. Information exchanged as a result of the conference will be made available to the public as soon as practical.

Please confirm the time and place for the pre-bid conference.

Answer: See Amendment #1

Are the CAD or Revit files available for Charlotte Hall?

Answer: See Amendment #1

Is the preproposal still on for the 10th? If so, when/where?

Answer: See Amendment #1

<p>NAICS CODE: 541712</p>
<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) TITLE: Controllable Contested Environment (CCE)</p>
<p>BAA ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>BAA NUMBER: BAA RIK-2015-0003</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800 &amp; 12.910</p>
<p><strong>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory - Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is soliciting white papers under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for research, design, development, concept testing, evaluation and experimentation with Command, Control, Communications, Computers &amp; Intelligence (C4I)-related information and communications technologies/techniques supporting the implementation and use of a controllable contested environment (CCE). In particular, this effort seeks to assess advanced communication, networking and RF technologies and concepts.<br />AFRL's Stockbridge facility is a 300 acre site that hosts a Controllable Contested Environment (CCE). This environment can be used to create a "real-world RF contested environment" where RF transmissions and receptions can be controlled and measured. Stockbridge also hosts Small Unmanned Aerial System (SUAS) flight operations from two 600 foot runways. This capability enables small payload packages to be flown in support of CCE and related experimentation. Additionally the site hosts microwave and optical line-of sight communication links with reach-back to AFRL/RI in Rome, NY and AFRL/RI's Newport Test Site located in Newport, NY.</p>
<p>The characteristics of today's electromagnetic environment, communications and networks may limit our combat effectiveness, especially in contested, degraded, operationally limited (CDO), and anti-access area denial (A2/AD) environments. The Stockbridge Controllable Contested Environment may be used to emulate the battlefield environment in cyberspace by hosting a very diverse set of tactical analog and digital communication systems, wired and wireless sensor and C2 networks. The CCE will have the flexibility and adaptability to create this complex RF and Cyber environment. Together the CCE and the SUAS enable the testing of emerging C4I capabilities on mobile platforms in near real-world environments.<br /><br />This BAA seeks white papers that propose new capabilities that will support the warfighter in an anti-access area denial (A2/AD) and contested spectrum environment. These technologies should focus on information technologies including communications, networking and RF technologies. Enhancement of capabilities of the Stockbridge Controllable Contested Environment (CCE) will be considered of secondary benefit. Potential efforts in this area may include technologies and techniques to control, monitor, configure and analyze the RF and spectrum environment. They may also include assessment, instrumentation and configuration and control of experimental systems. As new warfighter challenges emerge, new tools will be required to improve the usability, adaptability, and functionality of the CCE and SUAS environments.</p>
<p>Areas of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
<p><strong>Research and Development</strong> <br /><br />The battlefield in cyberspace today hosts a very diverse set of tactical analog and digital communications systems, wired and wireless sensor and Command and Control (C2) networks that are costly to maintain and lack the flexibility and adaptability to respond and adjust to changes in the environment. Radio and network cognitive capabilities are needed to autonomously anticipate and understand changes within the environment and be able to reconfigure and operate in the presence of interference or a threat by leveraging cross layer adaptability. The goal is enhanced warfighter mission assurance delivering the right information, at the right time, to the right place. Technology areas include, but are not limited to: Dynamic spectrum adaptation, RF environment adaptation and assessment, cognitive RF and networking techniques, Waveform development experimentation and assessment, communications and networking technologies for disadvantaged, deployed and small UAS environs, spectrum sharing techniques and assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Integration</strong></p>
<p>The Controllable Contested Environment and Small UAS experimentation capabilities provide an environment for integrating multiple technologies and concepts together in an experimental environment. This capability can facilitate experimentation with and assessment of new C4I capabilities that support the warfighter in an A2/AD environment. Whether the capability augments the existing CCE/SUAS or a warfighter capability, tools must facilitate an open architecture and support plug and play features to enable flexible test and experimentation set-up, execution and tear down.</p>
<p><strong>Demonstration, Experimentation and Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>The CCE/SUAS capability provides a venue for demonstrating and evaluating emerging C4I capabilities. Demonstration and experimentation must define and develop the scenarios, tools and methodology that will support showcasing and assessing the merits of the capability in a realistic environment (A2/AD, congested, contested, etc). This may require modifying scenarios and the environment as necessary, as well as the instrumentation and data collection tolls and methodologies required. Provide tools to capture and analyze the specified Measures of Performance and Measures of Effectiveness for the defined scenario. Advanced techniques for Data Management and Data Security are also of interest.</p>
<p>Successful Offerors will be provided access to the Stockbridge CCE and SUAS areas on a non-interference basis, during normal duty hours. Access may include access to AFRL-Rome Research Site (RRS) Building 3 if required. Access will include space for experiments at Stockbridge in Buildings 1477 &amp; 1480, as well as space in the CCE shelters distributed throughout the site. All space and personnel access requirements will be coordinated on a per effort basis, but in general space in a shelter would be one person, one computer plus 24 vertical inches of 19 inch rack-mount space. Space in building 1477 would be approximately 150-200 sq. ft., including bench and rack space, plus seating for up to 4 persons (for experiments only, no office space is available).</p>
<p><strong>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. FUNDING: Total funding for this BAA is approximately $9.9M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows:</p>

<p><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in <strong>descending order of importance</strong>, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Openness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any)</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.<br />&nbsp;<br />3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>4. FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS: The Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000) over the period of performance. An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants and per FAR 9.104-6 FAPIIS.</p>
<p><strong>VI. STEP TWO INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.<br />For additional information, a copy of the AFRL "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry," Mar 2015, and Proposal Preparation Instructions, Dec 2014, may be accessed at: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.</p>
<p>This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation.

<p>3. DATA RIGHTS:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. SBIR RIGHTS. The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. NON-SBIR RIGHTS. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.<br /><br />4. REPORTING: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Contract Applicable: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. FAPIIS Applicable: As required by 2 CFR 200 Appendix XII of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, non-federal entities (NFEs) are required to disclose in FAPIIS any information about criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings, and/or affirm that there is no new information to provide. This applies to NFEs that receive federal awards (currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts) greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of an award/project.</p>

<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) TITLE: Distributed Operations (DistrO)</p>
<p>BAA ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>BAA NUMBER: BAA-AFRL-RIK-2016-0003</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800</p>
<p><strong>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory/Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is soliciting white papers under this Broad Area Announcement (BAA) for research, design, development, test, evaluation, and experimentation of innovative and enabling capabilities that allow operators at forward nodes the ability to conduct state-driven assessment of Air Force operations and distributed adaptive planning, and to perform these capabilities during periods of reduced communications with operational level nodes in accordance with distributed operations concepts.</p>
<p>The Air Force is seeking capabilities in the form of software components that autonomously assess the progress of their operations, identify deviations from expected activities and outcomes, and recommend adjustments (re-plan) to enable continuous operations at forward nodes in anti-access and area-denial (A2/AD) environments.</p>
<p>The DistrO Program will meet the distributed operations goal by filling technology gaps for dynamic planning, execution, and assessment; and tailor those capabilities for use at the operational level and at the tactical level within a distributed architecture to provide a resilient "push forward" and "push outward" capability to implement the distributed operations concept. For the purpose of this research, offerors may consider elements of the Theater Air Control System (TACS) and Theater Air Ground System (TAGS) as nominal candidates representing operational environments for target technologies.</p>
<p>By developing these capabilities and achieving this goal, AFRL expects an order of magnitude improvement in the duration of maintaining continuity of air, space, and cyber operations at a forward node subject to contested communications; however, the focus of this effort is on the air domain with a desire not to preclude an approach that integrates all three domains. Additionally, efforts under this program are expected to provide the USAF and mission partners with a capability to conduct combat planning with its associated targeting and assessment forward in theater.</p>
<p>The DistrO Program has been organized into two projects, (1) Planning and Assessment Technology Development and (2) Distributed Integration and Experimentation, each with defined focus areas for the FY16 acquisition cycle.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The compartmentalization of the focus areas reflects project funding and thrusts. Offerors are invited to submit white papers for one or more of the focus areas/projects.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Project 1: Planning and Assessment Technology Development:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this project is to advance the state of the art in C2 technologies in order to tightly couple traditionally distinct planning and assessment activities in light-weight software services that can be employed to enable forward entities during times of isolation from the centralized Air Operations Center (AOC). Target software solutions should be compatible with smaller-footprint environments such as those found in the TACS/TAGS.</p>
<p>Research and development must be conducted to assist operators with the planning of Air Force operations, assessment of progress while identifying deviations from expected activities and outcomes, and recommending adjustments (re-plan). Assessment mechanisms will explicitly expose the immediate and projected problems from plan divergence. Adaptive planning mechanisms will be capable of both plan repair (for the current tasking cycle), and plan creation of future tasking cycles. Both the assessment and planning capabilities will operate as distributed replicated services across a federation of representative environments.</p>
<p>The following describes the Project 1, FY 16 Focus Area:</p>
<p><strong>Coupled State-Driven Assessment and Distributed Adaptive Planning:</strong> The Coupled State-Driven Assessment and Distributed Adaptive Planning focus area objective is to research and demonstrate a fundamentally coupled planning and assessment methodology in an environment representing the operational challenges described above. The goal is to providing C2 capabilities at forward entities during times of isolation from the AOC. Current operations utilize centralized planning and assessment activities at the AOC, and distribute orders in the form of the Air Tasking Order (ATO) directing forward entities to perform missions aligned with the Commander's intent. In order to perform C2 activities forward in theater, research and development must be conducted to advance planning and assessment activities which allow these entities to act with the best information available, while meeting the intent of the Commander. This will require reasoning over the various attributes comprising the context of the situation, to include intent, assessments, existing plan, etc. Assuming that communications with higher echelons will be lost, research must be done to identify and document the right artifacts which must be pushed forward prior to loss of communications, to include Commander's Intent, Air Operations Directive, and Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List, to name a few.</p>
<p>The near-term goal of this focus-area is to support the continued operations of forward entities (such as TACS/TAGS) for days beyond the current capability. The spirit of the longer-term research goal involves enabling continued operations through a "Living Plan" capability, where missions are planned far beyond the current time horizon, with plan branches, sequels, and adaptations are continually happening on a rolling basis, based on new world state information and assessments of on-going and future operations.</p>
<p>Providing an assessment of how a campaign is unfolding is extremely difficult, even if all co-located AOC operators have perfect and unambiguous situation awareness. It is even more difficult to conduct accurate and timely assessments at forward nodes within contested environments and uncertain world state. Meeting this challenge requires prepositioning commander's guidance at lower echelons and interfacing with local data sources and those in the cloud which may be accessible to conduct assessments, techniques to improve context formulation, trigger change notifications when plans deviate and recommend re-plan options.</p>
<p>Technologies are required to support the move from the current centralized, military planning paradigm to a distributed planning environment. Enabling continued operations through a "Living Plan" capability at forward nodes is paramount to success in anticipated anti-access/area-denial A2/AD environment. The complexities of this challenge lie in Disrupted, Disconnected, Intermittent and Limited (DDIL) bandwidth connectivity of distributed planning nodes. Distributed planning, assessment, and plan adaptation tasks need to be flexible to support traditional top-down planning paradigms, while enabling the complex synchronization of Air Force activities in a distributed, asynchronous manner during periods of DDIL connectivity. To address this focus area, the development of automated adaptive planning and assessment algorithms, as software services, are required to be capable of recommending new and revised missions based on assessments and world state information.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Project 2: Distributed Integration and Experimentation</strong></p>
<p>The two objectives of this project are to 1) integrate software components produced in Project 1 into a robust information cloud and 2) conduct tests/experiments to assess system-level efficacy of these combined technologies and determine amount of improvement.</p>
<p>The following describes the Project 2 FY 16 Focus Area:</p>
<p><strong>Integration, Demonstration, Test and Evaluation</strong>: As part of any research and development, the software shall be integrated, tested and evaluated to ensure the software satisfies measure of performance parameters. Offerors are encouraged to utilize concise metrics for measuring performance of proposed technical solutions. Metrics should be identified, tracked, and available for analysis during integrated evaluation and testing events. This research will develop and implement an overarching test and evaluation methodology that assesses both quantitative and qualitative metrics. This will also be comprised of developing sample end-user scenarios with varying degrees of simulated communication degradation and data that are mission-focused and relevant to the research and development emphasis of this BAA.</p>
<p>Also see the Supplemental Information Attachment.</p>
<p><strong>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. GOVERNMENT APPROVED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM: An offeror must have a government approved accounting system prior to award of a cost-reimbursement contract per limitations set forth in FAR 16.301-3(a) to ensure the system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The acceptability of an accounting system is determined based upon an audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). IMPORTANT: If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1</p>
<p><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in equal importance and will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted, are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Openness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology, and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>4. FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS: The Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000) over the period of performance. An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants and per FAR 9.104-6 FAPIIS.</p>
<p><strong>VI. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP TWO</span> INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>For additional information, a copy of the AFRL "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry," Mar 2015, and Proposal Preparation Instructions, Dec 2014, may be accessed at: https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Top Secret/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Top Secret/SCI information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.</p>
<p>This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation.

You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your white paper/proposal.</p>
<p>3. DATA RIGHTS:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. SBIR RIGHTS. The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. NON-SBIR RIGHTS. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Contract Applicable: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. FAPIIS Applicable: As required by 2 CFR 200 Appendix XII of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, non-federal entities (NFEs) are required to disclose in FAPIIS any information about criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings, and/or affirm that there is no new information to provide. This applies to NFEs that receive federal awards (currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts) greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of an award/project.</p>
<p>5. NOTICE: The following provisions* apply:<br /><br />(a) FAR 52.209-07, Information Regarding Responsibility Matters<br />(b) FAR 52.209-11, Representation by Corporations Regarding Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction under any Federal Law <br />(c) DFARS 252.203-7996, Prohibition on Contracting with Entities that Requirement Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements-Representation <br />(d) DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls <br />(e) DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk<br />* Please note that the current versions or deviations of the related clauses will be included in any resulting contract.</p>

It will be used to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified small businesses (e.g.: 8(a), small disadvantaged businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB), HUBZone small businesses, women-owned small businesses, and small business) to provide the services described herein. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) will use the information received to determine if the work described herein will be set-aside for small business. Based upon the results of the evaluation of the respondents' capabilities, CMS may set the work aside for a specific type of small business (i.e. HUBZone, WOSB, SDB, SDVOSB, or 8(a) small business), or determine that the work should be competed on an unrestricted basis.</p>
<p>Background<br />The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is the agency of the Federal Government that administers the Medicare and M&not;edicaid programs. CMS also supports the Affordable Care Act with the CMS Marketplace and supporting systems. It should be noted that the CMS Marketplace has become one of the most visible programs, both politically and technologically, in the Nation.</p>
<p>CMS is responsible for the payment of almost $1 trillion each year for medical services rendered to over 100 million program beneficiaries and recipients. CMS currently has approximately 4,500 employees at its central site in Baltimore, and in ten (10) regional offices in major cities throughout the country. CMS contracts with approximately thirty (30) companies to process claims for reimbursement for medical services rendered under the Medicare program, and works with all 50 states in the management of the Medicaid program. Several companies administer both Part A and Part B of the Medicare program. As a result, there are currently twenty-three (23) fiscal intermediaries and seventeen (17) carriers processing Medicare fee-for-service claims.</p>
<p>In the administration of these programs, CMS utilizes many assets including buildings, facilities, communications equipment, computer systems, employees, contractors, public trust, and information. A loss of any one of these assets could affect the quality of support provided by CMS to its various customers. In particular, CMS needs systems of cost effective computer security controls to protect CMS' critical information technology assets. CMS collects information that falls into the categories of privacy data, personal health data, proprietary data, procurement data, inter-agency data, and privileged system information. Access to these types of information is controlled by the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Computer Security Act of 1987, as amended, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Public Law 104-191, as amended and the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, as well as various rules, regulations, policies, and guidelines promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). As a result, CMS has a legal and practical responsibility to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of this information.<br />The CMS Information System (IS) Security Assessment and Authorization (SAA) Program is a critical component of the entire CMS Integrated IT Investment &amp; System Life Cycle, "Framework", which has been most recently updated to the CMS Expedited Life Cycle (XLC). All CMS systems must undergo a Security Controls Assessment (SCA) each year as part of effort towards obtaining or maintaining its current security accreditation and authorization to operation (ATO).</p>
<p>CMS has introduced many new technical initiatives in the last two (2) years including several new Cloud Services, Agile development, DevOps software deployment models, CI/CD processes, ongoing authorization, and build-in security processes. CMS is also building in a new CDM program per HHS directives. The Contractor will utilize these CMS initiatives to improve CMS' ability to automate as many security controls as possible and continue to move toward the Ongoing Authorization model.</p>
<p>CMS will focus security efforts on the most critical security controls (as defined by CMS).</p>
<p>The Security Controls Assessment (SCA) is conducted as part of the Security Assessment and Authorization (SAA) process for a new system before it is placed into an operational state, when a significant change has been made to an existing system, or at least every three years. CMS is moving away from this point-in-time testing model and pushing towards the ongoing authorization and build-in security in models where automated and frequent control testing is going to become the norm. Currently, the Security Controls Assessment (SCA) still plays a vital role with assisting and validating that appropriate management, operational, and technical security controls have been implemented for the information system and that CMS systems and data are protected.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of Security Controls Assessment (SCA) is to provide continuous security controls assessment and ongoing authorization (OA) support for the CMS Enterprise Information Security Group (ISPG). This will be achieved while maintaining compliance with the defined CMS IS policies, standards, procedures and guidelines as stated on the CMS Website: http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/index.html.</p>
<p>SCA Scope of Services and Required Capabilities<br />The Contractor shall perform SCAs of cyber-services, applications, databases, platforms, and infrastructures of all CMS FISMA systems. CMS systems are located throughout the continental United States in disparate data centers which are often built using a combination solution such as of bare-metal rack oriented servers, virtualized server technologies, Cloud Service Provider technologies (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), as well as various Identification and Authentication mechanisms such as SAML, OpenID, Oauth, and CSP IDaaS solutions.</p>
<p>Each CMS system may be composed of various heterogeneous technologies ranging from modern to legacy, which may include but is not limited to: all types of Cloud Service Provider technologies (MS Azure, AWS, Salesforce, etc.), microservice (API) based systems, various development frameworks and components such as .Net, Java, JMS, SOAP, REST, XML, JSON, JWT, supporting middleware, Unix, various flavors of Linux servers (RHEL, Solaris, Debian, CentOs, etc.), Windows servers (all versions), VMWare, database systems (MS SQL, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Hadoop, etc.), Mainframe technologies such as M204, DB2, RACF, CICS, COBOL, Host On Demand, TSO, z/OS, LDAP, RACF, Visual Basic, web systems such as IIS, WebSphere, MQ Messaging, Informatica, COGNOS, Citrix, and other products and technologies. Many applications are custom developed and will require a source code review and manual testing during the security assessment.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be able to perform SCAs and have experience in testing all of the technologies listed above (or similar technologies) and more, as well as capabilities in the following areas:</p>
<p>1. SCA CADENCE<br />CMS currently tracks approximately 230 systems in its system inventory. CMS maintains a rigorous pace of system security control evaluation throughout the fiscal year. The Center for Internet Security (CIS) has created a methodology of risk identification and prioritization of the top 20 high risk security areas for government and industry. Each system within CMS will have the CIS Top 20 Critical Security Controls (CSCs) - as well as some select CMS security and privacy controls - tested once per year by the Contractor. The Contractor will plan on a one (1) week "onsite" testing window for the vast majority of CMS systems and applications.</p>
<p>However, CMS has also approximately 40 data centers for which ALL of the CMS/NIST 800-53 rev 4 security controls will need to be tested (not just the CIS CSCs). It is reasonable to assume that these larger environments and larger control sets will take two (2) weeks for the Contractor to complete the respective security assessment.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide staff resources appropriately such that they are able to complete a total of 4 to 5 security assessments per week, allowing appropriate lead time when testing a larger data center. CMS estimates that the work defined in this SOW will require approximately 12 -15 fulltime staff to properly execute.</p>
<p>2. SCA CONTROL SET<br />A typical security assessment shall consist of testing systems for effective implementation of the CIS Top 20 Critical Security Controls (CSCs), as well as some additional CMS security and privacy controls. Appendix A contains a list of the CIS Top 20 CSCs for reference. This sample list of tests is not all-inclusive, and, all tests listed may not be required for all assessments. The Contractor will work with the Business Owner, ISSO, and ISPG to determine which types of tests are required for each system and its respective assessment.<br /><br />3. CDM INTEGRATION<br />The CMS Continuous Monitoring and Enterprise Vulnerability Management Programs use the nCircle IP360 system to scan for vulnerabilities at about 80% of CMS systems and applications. The system collects and reports on vulnerability information on operating systems, databases, and applications. When applicable, the Contractor shall be able to request nCircle IP360 reports for analysis in determining vulnerabilities during infrastructure SCAs and as directed by the GTL. <br />4. APPLICATION TIER TESTING<br />As part of the SCA, CMS requires that the Contractor place a strong emphasis on Application and Database security. This may include penetration testing with tools such as OWASP ZAP or Burp. An analysis of the application build process must also be performed and a source code analysis may be needed to supplement the security assessment.</p>
<p>The type and degree of analysis performed will depend largely on the type of application being assessed. Legacy applications built using COBOL will require little or no source code review. However, new web services, APIs, and other custom applications may require static application security testing (SAST) and/or dynamic application security testing (DAST).</p>
<p>5. TEST DATA TRANSFER AND STORAGE<br />The Contractor shall use the CMS internal system of record for security documentation, namely CFACTS, to store and share artifacts generated as a result of each assessment.</p>
<p>CMS has implemented the CMS FISMA Control Tracking System (CFACTS), Trusted Integration's Agent software, as the tool that tracks security deficiencies, Plan of Action &amp; Milestones (POA&amp;M), and Corrective Action Plans (CAPs). All security controls tested and findings discovered during an SCA must be presented in a CFACTS Management Worksheet at the end of the assessment and as part of the Final SCA Package.</p>

<DESC>NRM Automated Testing Tool Solutions
<p>For</p>
<p>United States Forest Service, Natural Resource Manager (NRM)</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This is not a solicitation. This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quote (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP), nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.</p>
<p>1. PURPOSE:<br />The US Forest Service (FS) Natural Resource Manager (NRM) is conducting market analysis with this RFI to obtain feedback, further refine and identify the "best-fit" automated testing tool/software. The primary focus is identified below.</p>
<p>The information collected in this RFI will be evaluated and assist the FS in the appropriate acquisition approach/strategy going forward.</p>
<p>Responding to this RFI does not automatically include the responder on any bidders list, if such a list is developed. Depending on the quantity and quality of the responses received, the criteria may serve to generate the initial pool of potential contractors to be invited to respond to a resulting solicitation.</p>
<p>2. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND:<br />NRM supports 14000+ Forest Service users with 65 + custom applications. These applications are used for upward reporting to Congress and senior management, and for information gathering and analysis. Currently, the business knowledge for functional testing is not harvested and reused. The testing team performs manual regression and sanity testing for monthly releases of 65 NRM applications Furthermore, during each round of testing for a release, test cases are executed manually and only documented only if a bug is discovered or an error occurs. Also sometimes the code fix for a bug or issue may break functionality that had pass prior testing or prior releases. <br />Due to the environments being set-up or changed, system upgrades, patching, and cloning, NRM is looking for the most suitable, most effective alternatives and solutions for obtaining and fulfilling the needs associated with automated testing software. In addition, redesign/modernization efforts have added significant volume of testing, since these efforts are implementing entire applications vs maintenance. With a limited testing resources, having an automation tool can assist in completing the repetitive, time consuming tasks and deadlines.</p>

<p>Please provide the following general information:<br />Automated Testing Tool Solution(s)</p>
<p>For</p>
<p>United States Forest Service, Natural Resource Manager (NRM)</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This is not a solicitation. This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quote (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP), nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.</p>
<p>1. PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The US Forest Service (FS) Natural Resource Manager (NRM) is conducting market analysis with this RFI to obtain feedback, and further refine and identify "best-fit" automated testing tool/software solution (s). On area of emphasis is to test modernized and redesigned applications, and if possible also the legacy applications. Additional information is identified below.</p>
<p>The information collected in this RFI will be evaluated and assist the FS in the appropriate acquisition approach/strategy going forward.</p>
<p>Responding to this RFI does not automatically include the responder on any bidders list, if such a list is developed. Depending on the quantity and quality of the responses received, the criteria may serve to generate the initial pool of potential contractors to be invited to respond to a resulting future solicitation.</p>
<p>2. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>NRM supports 14000+ Forest Service users with 65 + custom applications. These applications are used for upward reporting to Congress and senior management, and for information gathering and analysis. Currently, the business knowledge for functional testing is not harvested and reused. The testing team performs manual regression and sanity testing for monthly releases of these 65 + NRM applications Furthermore, during each round of testing for a release, test cases are executed manually and only documented if a bug is discovered or an error occurs. Additionally at times the code fix for a bug or issue may break functionality that had pass prior testing or prior releases. <br />Due to the environments being set-up or changed, system upgrades, patching, and cloning, NRM is seeking the most suitable, most effective alternatives and solutions for obtaining and fulfilling the needs associated with automated testing software. <br />As well, redesign/modernization efforts have added a significant volume of testing, since these efforts are implementing entire applications vs. maintenance. With limited testing resources, having an automation tool will assist in completing the repetitive, time consuming tasks and deadlines. The software should have some type of feature to allow non-programmers (the testing team) to generate test cases without having to write scripts.</p>

<DESC><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE: Indian Health Service</strong> - Implementing Purchased Referred Care Rates for Non-Hospital Medical Services<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">INTRODUCTION &amp; PURPOSE<br /><br /></span><strong>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice</strong>. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND<br /><br /></span>The Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for providing federal health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). IHS provides a comprehensive health service delivery system for approximately 1.9 million AI/AN who belong to 567 federally recognized tribes in 36 states. The Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) Program plays a major role in the IHS provision of care. Under the PRC program, primary and specialty health care services that are not available at IHS or tribal facilities are purchased from private health care providers.
<p>This request is made in accordance with final rule 42 CFR Part 136, RIN 0917-AA12, "Payment for Physician and Other Health Care Professional Services Purchased by Indian Health Programs and Medical Charges Associated with Non-Hospital-Based Care". The final regulation was published in the Federal Register on March 21, 2016, with an effective date of May 20, 2016, and a final implementation date of March 21, 2017. The rule amends the regulation at 42 CFR Part 136 subpart D, and adds a new subpart I "Payment for provider and supplier services purchased by Indian health programs" to apply the Medicare payment methodologies to all physician and other health professional services and non-hospital-based services purchased by an IHS or Tribal PRC program, or urban Indian organization (I/T/U) authorized to receive these services. It allows these programs to negotiate or pay non-I/T/U providers based on the applicable Medicare fee schedule, prospective payment system, Medicare Rate, Medicare waiver or most favored customer rate.</p>
<p>The IHS contracts the services of a certified fiscal intermediary (FI) agent to provide a centralized medical and dental claims processing service, maintain reimbursement and reporting systems as well as calculate payment rates in accordance with MLR regulations, PRC rule and the IHS payment policy.</p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to identify a potential trainer(s) to provide education and support for Tribal PRC program staff on implementing most favored customer (MFC) rates and computing PRC Rates for non-hospital medical services based on the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Part B payment systems: "Data Entry and Calculations" under the Inpatient Physicians Payment System (IPPS), and PC Pricer pricing methodologies in estimating charges for purchase order obligations on behalf of the health care providers and suppliers within the PRC program. Estimating charges for purchase orders ensures critical PRC budgets and spending plans reflect a close estimate of actual funds to maintain a consistent level of services throughout the year.</p>
<p>The PRC Rates rule allows the amount negotiated by a repricing agent; or the provider or supplier's MFC. In the event that a Medicare rate does not exist for an authorized item or service, and no other payment methodology provided by the rule is applicable, the rule authorizes payment at 65% of authorized charges. Paying at the Medicare rates allows the PRC program to purchase more health care for AI/AN patients. The use of Medicare rates is necessary to coordinate patient benefits and process medical and dental claims, to ensure that the PRC program is the payor of last resort for services provided to patients and calculate Medicare rates in accordance with the PRC Rates regulations and the IHS payment policy.</p>
<p>These services are also made available to tribes that contract and compact their PRC programs under the Indian Self-Determination Education and Assistance Act (P.L. 93-638). This final rule establishes reimbursements that are consistent across Federal health care programs and aligns payment with inpatient services, and enables the I/T/U to expand beneficiary and access to medical care.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROJECT REQUIREMENT</span></strong></p>
<p>The trainer will be expected to understand the mission of the IHS and its health care delivery system as well as the purpose and function of the PRC Program and the new PRC Rates regulation. The trainer must have a basic understanding of the IHS Financial Management System that interfaces claims through the IHS Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) and Purchased Referred Care/Management Information System (PRC/MIS) as well as tribal financial management systems.</p>
<p>The RPMS system is a decentralized integrated solution for management of both clinical and administrative information in the IHS healthcare facilities. RPMS software applications have been, and continue to be, customized and enhanced based on input from users throughout the entire Indian Healthcare system.</p>
<p>Claims Processing System: Must have knowledge of the CMS Part B payment systems, compute charges using "Data Entry and Calculation for IPPS" and commercial PC Pricers and be able to determine the reimbursement rates for all the different fee schedules, but not limited to the following:</p>
<p>- CMS Medicare Pricer <br />- Provider Carrier/Locality Code<br />- Medicare Fee Schedule (MFS) Pricer<br />- Anesthesia Base Units<br />- CMS Ambulance Fee Schedule<br />- End Stage Renal Dialysis (ESRD) Pricer<br />- Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) &amp; Wage Index File<br />- Physician's fee schedule<br />- Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) fee schedule<br />- Drug fee schedule<br />- Lab fee schedule<br />- Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS)<br />- Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS)<br />- Outpatient Code Editor (OCE)<br />- Hospital Outpatient PPS <br />- National Correct Coding Initiative Edits <br />- Outpatient PPS Pricer Code <br />- National Technical Information Service (NTIS) <br />- ICD-10 Coding Basics <br />- Transmittals</p>

 ______________________________________________________________________<br />Inititial Posting<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />HM157517R0001<br />National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency<br />Construction Site Security Services<br />1.0 Description<br />1.1 The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in support of Construction of the New St. Louis Facility is seeking information on how an interested contractor could provide construction site security services.<br />1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, NGA is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<br />2.0 Background<br />N2W Requirement: The N2W facility is required to replace mission critical facilities in St. Louis that have exceeded their service life. The project will accommodate new technologies and processes that will generate beneficial synergies through integration, collaboration, and geospatial data immersion. The &lsquo;purpose-built' facility will provide an open flexible work environment that is scalable, reconfigurable, and adaptive to changing mission requirements and the associated changes in workflow and data sharing methodologies. The project will provide NGA's workforce with safe, secure, and efficient facilities that will meet the agency's long-term requirements and vision for Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) and will be consistent with the Director National Intelligence (DNI) facilities strategic plan. Given the scale of the construction project and the need for NGA to move from existing facilities minimizing dual operating costs, the N2W will require the builder to provide transition phase services from immediately after beneficial occupancy date (BOD) for up to 24 months later when the facility will be ready for full operational capability (FOC).<br />2.1 Delivery Period: Estimated to be five years, only during the construction phase of this project.<br />2.2 Considerations:<br />2.2.1. Official start date for this project is currently TBD<br />2.2.2. The site is located in an urban environment.<br />2.2.3. Design of the future building, floors and shape, is TBD.<br />2.2.4. Estimated square forage of the building is 800,000<br />2.2.5. The site property comprises 99 acres. <br />2.3 Security Requirements: <br />2.3.1. The completed N2W shall result in a secure facility constructed in accordance with Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 705. Some key design personnel on the design-build team shall be required to have various levels of active security clearances.<br />2.3.2. All Offerors and subcontractors shall be required to comply with DFARS 252.225-7050, Disclosure of ownership or control by the government of a country that is a state sponsor of terrorism, DFARS 252.209-7002, Disclosure of Ownership or Control by a Foreign Government and DFARS 252.209-7004, Subcontracting with firms that are owned or controlled by the government of a country that is a state sponsor of terrorism.<br />2.3.3. Construction Surveillance Technicians (CSTs) shall have a Top Secret Clearance (TS) to begin. CST's shall also have the ability to achieve TS-Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) clearance to accommodate phases of this construction project.<br />2.3.4. Personnel required for duties other than CST, shall be properly accredited and cleared with the proper security clearance up to TS-SCI when required according to the phased construction. The level of security clearance will depend on the progress of the building construction along with accreditation and approval of classification spaces. The proper clearance level will ensure contractors are able to enter spaces required to do their job as the progression of the building is enclosed and classified. <br />2.3.5. Security of the construction site, inspecting vehicles of all types entering the construction site, inspecting construction materials entering the site as well as monitoring the point of manufacture (ie: concrete plant) and personnel entering the site shall carry a high importance. <br />3.0 Requested Information<br />3.1 Performance Work Statement Feedback and Recommendations: Respondents are requested to review the attached PWS and provide recommendations on content and approach to include methods of performance, delivery, workload estimating and deliverables.<br />3.2 Capabilities on Required Services: Respondents are requested to submit a detailed description of their capabilities to provide all or a portion of the services outlined in the PWS. This shall include relevant experience, in house capabilities and small business subcontracting opportunities and partnerships.<br />3.3 Personnel Recruitment, Retention, and Timing: Respondents are requested to submit a capabilities statement that shows how trained and cleared personnel will be provided to meet all security requirements throughout the five year construction process, to include lead time for onsite personnel. This shall include the ability to staff Construction Surveillance Technicians (CSTs) as required and to staff and bring cleared, trained personnel onsite. Describe the methodology to staff TS CSTs in the St. Louis, MO area.<br />3.4 Additional requested information<br />4.0 Responses<br />4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.<br />4.2 White papers in Microsoft Word or PDF format are due no later than December 20, 2016.

A small business concern for the purposes of this procurement is generally defined as a business, including its affiliates, averaging no more than $20.5 M million dollars in annual receipts. Annual receipts of a concern that has been in business for 3 or more complete fiscal years means the annual average gross revenue of the concern taken for the last 3 fiscal years. Annual receipts of a concern that has been in business for less than 3 complete fiscal years means its total receipts for the period it has been in business, divided by the number of weeks including fractions of a week that it has been in business, and multiplied by 52. Respondents are cautioned, however, that this is a general description only. Additional standards and conditions apply. Please refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 19 for additional detailed information on Small Business Size Standards.

<p>THIS IS A FOLLOW-ON REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>IT SECURITY PROVISIONS AND 508 COMPLIANCE LANGUAGE IS ALREADY OBTAINED FROM PREVIOUS CONTRACT.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procurement:</span></p>
<p>1. UDP LIMS 24/7 with Modules Support Subscription (including: Live Support via phone, email, online services, version updates, cover upgrades, production licenses, user Test License owned by UDP, hardware purchased and supported by RuRo), Quantity: One (1).<br />2.

Quantity: One (1).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. To that end NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health.</p>
<p>NHGRI Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objective:</span></p>
<p>The UDP program makes use of a diverse set of diagnostic and research techniques both to attempt to find a diagnosis and to generate research projects to advance medical knowledge. RuRo, Inc. has developed the enterprise-grade LIMS 24/7 web platform called UDPics that encompasses project, task and asset management; user role configurability; user-tailored report; extensive audit functionality and information security that is required by the UDP laboratory. UDPics is designed to be the meeting place of laboratory software tools, laboratory hardware, and staff users, allowing previously impossible levels of secure data access, communication and process efficiency.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Justification:</span></p>
<p>The multi-user nature of NIH's UDP Translational Laboratory, along with its dynamic process structures, engenders a deep set of requirements for any candidate data and project management system. The enterprise-grade LIMS 24/7 platform is a web-based system that encompasses project, task and asset management; user role configurability; user-tailored reporting; extensive audit functionality and information security. LIMS 24/7 is designed to be the meeting place of laboratory software tools, laboratory hardware, and staff users, allowing previously impossible levels of secure data access, communication and process efficiency. In order to further develop a system that completely encompasses the scope of the Undiagnosed Diseases Program, RuRo, Inc. shall full premium support of UDPics that consists of further system upgrades and revisions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance:</span></p>
<p>12-Months; Upon Receipt of Award.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Place of Performance:</span></p>

SPECIFICATIONS OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 
This Sources Sought is issued solely for market research information to identify potential sources that are interested in, and capable of, performing the work described in this Sources Sought. No contract will be awarded from this announcement, and no reimbursement will
be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice. The Naval
Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Southwest is performing this market research to aid in the development of its acquisition approach.

NAVFAC Southwest is seeking to identify companies with the capacity, experience and interest in competing for a fixed priced, performance-based contract for Electrical Safety, Operation and Maintenance Professional Services Contract for a performance period of one (1) year.
 The NAICS code for this procurement is 611430 Professional and Management Development Training.

In order to meet the ever changing needs of our current and future workforce, NAVFAC is searching the marketplace for companies that are capable of providing professional and advisory services including training on electrical safety training and conduct filed compliance inspections of standard electrical safety procedures, referred to as Electrical Safe Acts For Employees (ESAFEs). The NAVFAC ESAFE Program was developed to comply with 29 CFR 1910 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),  the 2015 edition of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 70E Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace, and Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-560-01 Electrical Safety, Operations and Maintenance Guidelines.
  In addition, there are special training requirements under this contract, since a portion of the work will be dealing with Navy ships, which involves specifically connecting Navy Ships to shore power. Therefore, the trainer(s) shall understand these unique requirements. The ESAFE program components do not stand alone and are designed to be implemented as a whole.  The Program objective is to provide the necessary personnel protective equipment (PPE), safety equipment, and procedures to ensure personnel operate electrical equipment in a safe manner. The purpose of this contract is only for training the procedures and verifying compliance.

All government personnel at various installations within Navy Region Southwest are required to comply with the ESAFEs being trained.
  The ESAFE Program outlines the steps to be taken to ensure all installations are operating under the same standards for common systems with the most up-to-date and accurate information.  The goals of the ESAFE training and inspection effort are to ensure NAVFAC Southwest (SW) Public Works Business Line (PWBL) Personnel have proper written guidance and training to support a safe working environment around electrical equipment.

The proposed contract will provide for professional and advisory services to include training of utility electricians, engineers and other personnel to implement safe procedures and perform proper operation and maintenance of electrical utility equipment.

The National Cemetery Administration is soliciting offers under solicitation number VA786-17-R-0153.
This acquisition is 100% set aside for Veteran-Owned Small Businesses. The NAICS Code is 236220   Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  Business Size Standard is $36.5 million.  Project Description: Following the plans and specifications provided, rehabilitate the historic lodge at Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery. The lodge was originally constructed in 1905 as the cemetery office and caretaker s living quarters. Over time, the function of the lodge shifted to office space for the Memorial Program Services (MPS) staff. Generations of unsympathetic alterations have compromised the historic integrity of both the interior and exterior. This rehabilitation project seeks to reverse those alterations and restore the interior to reflect the 1905 design, with 21st century technology.  Mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems will be upgraded. The construction of a small rear addition will provide an accessible entrance, meeting space, and accessible restroom facilities. The introduction of a limited use/limited application (LULA) accessible lift will allow vertical circulation to all three levels in the lodge. Site improvements will provide elements to increase the accessibility into the historic structure.

The contractor shall furnish materials, tools, equipment and personnel necessary to accomplish the scope of work in the specifications and drawings. Work will be required from highly skilled carpenters, painters, plumbers, electricians, historic brick and stone masons, iron workers and laborers. Solicitation documents outline the full scope of work, and will require contractor to understand in great detail the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. The contractor s performance will be monitored by daily performance logs submitted to the COR, and by the COR visiting the site at significant milestones dictated by the construction schedule.  The contractor shall complete all work within 300 calendar days after issuance of Notice to Proceed.  Time stated includes final cleanup of the premises.  Construction Estimated Price Range: Between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  Location:  Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery, Historic Lodge Rehabilitation, Fort Leavenworth, KS 66027.

<DESC>Limited-sources justification (LSJ) award of a Task Order to HP Enterprise Services, LLC (HP ES), under GSA-BPA ID02120007, awarded under GSA FSS, contract No. GS-35F-0323J, on behalf of the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) for the procurement of Middleware Support for ActivClient Middleware licenses. The order will be placed on a Firm-Fixe Price basis.
<p>DMDC requested that GSA's Assisted Acquisition Services (AAS) Division procure and award an order for Middleware Support Services for ActivClient Middleware. The support will be provided to the U.S. Army, for its 800,000 seat licenses of ActivClient Middleware, from the day after award for a period of one year providing support from December 22, 2016 through December 21, 2017 per attached LSJ details.</p>
<p>In summary, Middleware products are uniquely constructed and the data rights to the construction are owned by the manufacturer. Only the manufacturer of a particular middleware product is in a position to render support services for its particular product. In the case of this acquisition, the Government has already fielded 800,000 seat licenses of ActivClient, which have been in use successfully for many years, for which only support services provided by ActivIdentity will suffice.</p>
