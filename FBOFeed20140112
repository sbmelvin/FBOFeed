<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
