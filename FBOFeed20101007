<DESC><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><br />The Library of Congress intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) on behalf of the National Defense University Library System to procure a new integrated library system to meet shared cataloging and resource needs. The NDU Library System consists of two academic libraries, the National Defense University Library at Ft Leslie J. McNair in Washington DC and the Ike Skelton Library at JFSC in Norfolk, VA. The project will replace the current Horizon software with a commercial off the shelf (COTS) product that will provide access through the web to library holdings, military resources, commercial resources and Internet resources both in the library at each campus and remotely for NDU students, staff, and faculty. The NDU Library manages the library system currently consisting of SirsiDynix Horizon 7.4.x, and Horizon Information Portal 3.0.8. The Horizon ILS supporting two libraries contains 310,000 bibliographic records, 509,000 items records and 6,000 borrowers. On average, 33,000 items are checked out monthly. In addition, the system houses the 171,000 MARC records of the Staff College Automated Military Periodical Index (SCAMPI) database which contains the indexed records from a variety of military and naval periodicals and other resources. The NDU Library currently uses the Ex Libris SFX OpenURL resolver and Metalib federated search, but will be switching to Serials Solutions 360 Services including Link and Search and the Summon Webscale Discovery tool. All responses to this synopsis shall be in writing. No telephone calls will be accepted. For information about the Library of Congress FEDLINK program, please visit www.loc.gov/flicc. The RFP will be posted on or about August 9, 2010</span></p>

<DESC>The National Science Foundation has a requirement for an electronic subscription to the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) via the Web of Knowledge platform. NSF proposed to procure this service directly from Thomson Reuters (Scientific) Inc on a single source basis for fiscal year 2011. The order will include 4 one-year option period to continue the service. <br /><br />The SSCI and SCIE databases provide bibliographic information for journal articles in the entire range of the sciences and social sciences. These databases of the latest peer reviewed literature are delivered via an integrated, versatile research platform, Web of Knowledge. The tool provides database service that combines evaluated content with the tools to use, manage, and analyze peer-reviewed scientific literature directly from scientists' desktops. It is used to find possible panelists for grant evaluations and provides unique features for obtaining author addresses and analyzing data for conflicts of interest. <br /><br />Additionally, the databases provide fully-searchable citation information for the sciences and social sciences. This allows program officers to examine the impact of previous research so that they can better evaluate the importance of research areas and also the prominence of possible panelists and principle investigators. <br /><br />These databases are only available from the producer, Thomson Scientific, Inc., and this firm is the only provider of these products and no comparable product is available. All responsible sources may respond to this announcement. See note 22 (except substitute 5 days for 45 days).

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for:Qty:1 Dual Channel Pulse Height Analyzer.Qty:1 Quad 1-kV Bias SupplyNASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items listed below:Specifications for a Dual Channel Pulse Height Analyzer:A dual channel pulse-height analyzer (PHA) is needed for testing solid-state detectors.Some of these tests will be performed as stand-alone tests using data accumulationand data display/analysis software provided by the vendor.  This software will need,at a minimum, to be able to locate histogram peaks and determine the total number ofcountsin any user-selected region of interest. In addition, there will be other tests whichwill be controlled by LabVIEW (TM) software which the user will generate.  This means that thevendor will need to also supply software drivers compatible with LabVIEW so that the collection of pulse-height data can be controlled by the user-supplied software.Each of the two PHAs will have to provide 8000 battery backed-up PHA channels. Each PHA will need to have integral non-linearity better than +- 0.025 % and differential non-linearity better than +- 1%, each over the top 99% of the dynamic range.  Inaddition, gain stability needs to be better than 100 ppm/degree C.  Coincidence/anti-coincidence logic between the two PHAs is desirable.  The input pulses will be standard bipolaror unipolar shaped pulses with characteristic shaping times of ~ 1-2 microseconds.Typical signals will correspond to 0.1 to 10 MeV. The dual channel PHA should be in a NIM module.Specifications for a Quad 1-kV Bias Supply:A bias supply with 4 separate output voltages is needed to support testing of solid-statedetectors.  This should be a NIM-based unit with the possibility to control each separatevoltage using LabVIEW. This could be either by direct commands to the power supply unitor by supplying 4 separate external control voltages in the approximate range from 0 - 10volts.	In the latter case the user would need to provide external LabVIEW-controlled DACs.Each of the 4 output voltages would need to be selectable in the range 10 - 1000 Volts and with ripple less than 2 mV peak to peak over a frequency range from 10 Hz to 100 MHz.The bias supply must be able to be shut down in the event of a loss of vacuum (detected externally). Front-mounted controls should allow maual control of the 4separate power supplies and should include an LED display for displaying the output voltagesand currents. Automatic shutdown should occur if the detector current exceeds ~ 20microamps.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.This document should not be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will theGovernment pay for the information solicited.    Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 5:00 p.m. EasternStandard Time on 10/14/10. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely forthe purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitivebasis.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) on behalf of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) to negotiate/award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Zhennan Lai, 2 Boat House Court, Gaithersburg, MD 20878 for the purchase of professional consulting services.

The reference number NHLBI-PB-(DE)-2011-004-CRS. 

This procurement of professional services is to perform, prepare, and analyze samples from Sjogrens patients using microarray technologies.

Primary Sjogrens Syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by exocrine gland dysfunction primarily involving the salivary and lacrimal gland. The histologic hallmark of Sjogrens Syndrome is a periductal inflammatory infiltrate. The conventional explanation of salivary gland dysfunction assumes a causal relationship between this chronic inflammatory process and the decreased saliva production is limited. Moreover, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive treatments have little effect on saliva production. Although various physiologic abnormalities related to inflammatory mediators have been described, none of these satisfactorily explains the SG dysfunction. On the other hand, no study has addressed whether patients with Sjogrens Syndrome have any intrinsic abnormalities in the salivary gland that may predispose them to SG dysfunction.

In this study, NIDCR plans to identify any salivary gland abnormalities that may predispose to Salivary Gland dysfunction in Sjogrens Syndrome patients. To explore if the striking female predominance of SS can be explained by intrinsic differences in salivary glands, we will compare the gene expression profiles of healthy men and woman as well as mouse models of the disease. This approach may identify abnormalities that are either intrinsic to the salivary gland (male to female and normal to SS comparison) or are important in the chronic inflammatory process (normal looking cells vs. cells from infiltrate). 

The sole source determination is based on the fact that Dr. Zhennan Lai has the background, knowledge, and experience needed for this research project. Dr. Lais extensive background in microarray technology to develop new (DNA/Protein) micro-tip (array) technique (manual and automation) for use in the diagnosis detection of mutation/SNP site on genetic neurological disorders, such as N370S type-1 Gaucher disease (GD) and also in monitoring patient response to treatment. Dr Lai received his Ph.D. in Pharmaceutical Science from the University of Uppsala in Sweden in 1994 and has eight years experience in the field of molecular biology performing genetic analysis using the latest microarray technology. He has worked in the industry as a Research Scientist for PDD Biotech, Inc. to develop novel technology that follows changes in genes expression. He is named as an inventor on patent application No. 60/738,974 regarding the use of genetic biomarkers for neurometabolic disorders, which is applicable to NIDCRs needs on this research project in Sjogrens Syndrome. Dr. Lais background and experience meet the needs of NIDCRs current research project as a contractor.

This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. This is a small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $7.0M.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-(DE)-2011-004-CRS may be submitted by mail to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6150B, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Caitlin Savina, by fax transmission to (301)480-3345 or by email to savinacr@nhlbi.nih.gov

A 600-vehicle, multi-story parking garage is included as a Bid Option.
 The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining all permits.

The proposed layout for the site is configured to avoid impacting nearby wetlands and embankments.  New facilities and pavement areas shall be configured in conformance with standoffs under current AT/FP criteria.  Development in this area avoids placing the facilities within the limits of a nearby landfill, closed in the 1950s.  The site for this project lies north of a proposed new four lane base entrance highway, extending east-west across the Wallace Creek area.  This roadway is currently under design, and will be built under separate contract(s).  The main access road serving the site, Wallace Creek Road, is currently under design and construction, also by separate contract.

This requirement is for basic/applied R&D efforts for hydrogen storage and fuel cell system design concepts for operational demonstration.  This endeavor will culminate one or more cost-type contract awards.  The primary performance objective of this effort is to replace the current batteries in the battery powered fleet of Class II forklifts (stock selectors) operated at Defense Distribution Center Warner Robins, Georgia (DDWG) (30 total) with fuel cell powered units.  The overarching objective of this program is to identify, design and complete a 12 month operational demonstration to validate fuel cell power units operationally and to significantly increase the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRL's) associated with fuel cell power system designs for DOD forklift applications.  TRL and MRL definitions may be found at: http://akss.dau.mil/dag/GuideBook/IG_c10.5.2.asp and https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=18231 respectively. 
The secondary objective of this effort is to expand and improve the hydrogen infrastructure technologies used to support a fleet of stock selectors and other hydrogen powered equipment operated at DDWG.  The current infrastructure that is being installed at DDWG is based on natural gas reforming at a centralized location at Robins AFB and then subsequently delivering, via mobile refueler, to six locations around the base where hydrogen powered equipment refill operations occur.  Operations conducted utilizing this support infrastructure are limited by refill times when the mobile refueler is present at each of the refill locations.  Proposals are requested to identify alternate solutions that will expand the existing hydrogen refill operational capabilities at select hydrogen refill locations.
The third objective is to compile operational data to further support our ongoing development of the business case surrounding the use of hydrogen fuel cell powered material handling equipment in DOD warehousing operations. 
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration database and have a Defense Contract Audit Agency approved accounting system.  The Government intends to award to the responsible contractor(s) who offer the best value to the Government as described in the evaluation criteria listed in section M of the RFP.  The solicitation will be available on or about 15 JAN 2010 at the following address: http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm.  It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor the Crane web site, FedBizOpps and/or NECO for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation.  For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.  "No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed".  Interested sources must download from the www site listed. Offer must be submitted in the format specified in the solicitation. Questions should be directed to Ms. Lorna Tribby at telephone 812-854-6021 or email lorna.tribby@navy.mil (preferred method).

<CONTACT>Kala Shankar, Sr. Contract Specialist, Phone 301-492-3638, Fax 301-492-3437, Email kala.shankar@nrc.gov - Jeffrey R. Mitchell, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 492-3639, Fax (301) 492-3437, Email jeffrey.mitchell@nrc.gov
<DESC>The importance of seismically-induced (or dynamic) pressure on walls was recognized by Okabe (1924) and Mononobe (1929) following the great Kanto earthquake of 1923. This insight led to the development of the Mononobe-Okabe (M-O) method for determining seismically-&not;induced lateral earth pressures on walls. Although decades have passed since the M-O method was developed, and a number of other relationships and methods have been developed, seismically-induced lateral earth pressures are still very poorly understood and very few predictive tools exist. This is because the difficulties of obtaining actual field data, coupled with the complexity and cost of the necessarily large scale laboratory studies, have resulted in a problematic lack of data. As a result, the M-O method is still the most widely used tool for predicting seismically-induced lateral earth pressure with finite element modeling used for advanced analyses. Unfortunately, lack of accuracy and precision remain significant issues. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is interested in investigating new approaches to the determination of dynamic lateral earth pressures during seismic events. <br /><br />In an effort to address this need, several years ago the NRC undertook a project in which Brookhaven National Laboratory used the computational tools SASSI and LS DYNA to attempt to replicate seismic wall pressure that had been recorded in a series of experiments undertaken by the Nuclear Power Engineering Corporation (NUPEC ) through support by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan. The BNL analyses and results are reported in NUREG/CR-6957. The NUPEC Seismic Field Test Program is described in NUREG/CR-6822. Unfortunately, while the analyses were able to replicate the acceleration of the structures to a large degree, the predicted lateral pressures showed a poor fit to the recorded data. This work again showed the challenges the engineering community faces in predicting dynamic lateral earth pressures with the level of accuracy desired by the structural engineering community. <br /><br />Accurate prediction of seismically-induced earth pressures and the associated structural response are of interest for NRC staff because several advanced reactor designs propose to fully or partially embed reactor structures as one of their major design features. <br /><br />NRC research has the principal goals of providing technical bases and technical tools to aid NRC staff in making regulatory decisions and developing and disseminating regulatory guidance that is used by both the NRC staff and the nuclear industry to make safety decisions by the agency. Research outcomes should be consistent with and support these goals.
<p>The objectives of this contract are to assess existing analytical tools and develop recommendations on their appropriate use for calculating soil pressures and structural response of partially to fully embedded nuclear power plants under seismic loading conditions. <br /><br />It is anticipated that this requirement will result in one (1) contract award. It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract. <br />The period of performance of the resultant contract will be forty eight (48) months from date of award. <br /><br />The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about October 22, 2010, and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

 EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2010 - VERIFICATION OF STATUS OF APPARENTLY SUCCESSFUL OFFEROR

(a)  The apparently successful offeror, unless currently listed as verified in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) at:  www.vetbiz.gov database, shall submit to Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) within five business days of receipt of written notice of its status as the apparently successful offeror, a verification application in accordance with 38 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 74 with such reasonably adequate documentary material, as necessary, establishing as follows:

(1)  The owner or owners of 51 percent or more of the offeror is/are service-disabled Veteran(s), Veteran(s), or an eligible surviving spouse thereof, as applicable, for the instant acquisition.  In this regard, the apparently successful offeror shall submit a VA Form 0877 to CVE via VA's VIP at:  www.vetbiz.gov, internet site.  This confidential and secure electronic application will enable CVE to inform the CO of the service-disabled Veteran or Veteran status of the owner(s) of the offeror without the CO having to receive and secure confidential individually identifiable information or personal health care information on this topic.

(2)  Eligible parties own 51 percent or more of the concern (see 38 CFR 74.3).  Adequate documentation can include copies of official stock certificates, articles of incorporation, partnership agreement, operating agreement, or other similar documentation which reasonably demonstrates the percentage of ownership by eligible parties; and

(3)  Eligible parties control the concern (See 38 CFR 74.4).  Control includes both the strategic policy setting exercised, for example, by boards of directors, and the day to day management and administration of business operations.  Adequate documentation should include articles of incorporation, corporate by laws, partnership agreement, operating agreement, resumes, disclosure of any other current employment, or other relevant documentation, as applicable, which demonstrates control of the strategic and day to day management of the offeror by eligible parties, as applicable.

(b)  CVE will examine the business documents to determine if they establish appropriate ownership and control of the business from which an offer has been received.  Within 21 business days, CVE shall determine whether the firm can or cannot be verified as a SDVOSB or VOSB, as appropriate, and issue its decision thereon to the vendor in accordance with 38 CFR 74.11(e) and to the CO.  The CO will use CVE's decision in making the source selection decision.

(c)  If a competing vendor raises a status protest prior to CVE's completion of its verification examination, the CO may rely on the status protest decision when issued.

(d)  This deviation will expire December 31, 2011.  Thereafter, in accordance with VAAR 804.102, COs shall only make awards to SDVOSBs or VOSBs which are listed as verified at:  www.vetbiz.gov.

In addition, current annual Representations and Certifications must be filed online at https://orca.bpn.gov.  

SDVOSB firms that meet the requirements listed in this announcement are invited to submit two (2) copies of SF 330 Part I and Part II to the Contracting Officer, Attn:  Christine Hernandez, VA Medical Center, Boiler House Road & 6th Street, Building 101B, Room 10, Perry Point, MD  21902, and reference the announcement number and project title listed NLT 2:00 PM (EST), November 4, 2010.

<DESC>Overview:
<p>This Sources Sought Synopsis is a Request for Information to assist the Hill AFB, Utah Range Threat System Program Office (RTSPO) in Market Research of Industry to determine the feasibility of a Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) Increment 1 (Block 0, Kit 1) Follow-on production effort based on a full and open competitive acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>The RTSPO plans to award a 5-year Firm Fixed Price contract to produce a minimum of seven (7) to a maximum of fifteen (15) Threat Emitter Units (TEUs) and three (3) mobile Command and Control Units referred to as mobile (C2Us) and two (2) fixed Command and Control Units referred to as (C2Us).</p>
<p>The original baseline JTE Increment 1 (Block 0, Kit 1) system was designed and 16 of these units were produced and delivered under a delivery order F09603-01-D-0209-QP05 to MTC Technologies, Inc. - Cage Code 9J721. The delivery period of this contract has expired without fulfilling the government's requirement for JTE systems resulting in this requirement for a JTE Follow-on production effort.</p>
<p>The Joint Threat Emitter (JTE) Program was initiated to improve realistic Electronic Warfare Training and to replace many of the aging threat emitters that are already in the present inventory. The JTE must be reliable, mobile, affordable, re-programmable, modular, remotely operated, easily maintained, and operated with minimum amount of manpower. To reduce the costs of re-design, re-testing and to limit the logistics/sustainment trail, these units must follow the original production baseline produced under the contract stated above in form, fit and function as closely as possible. The JTE Follow-on program objectives as described in the JTE Capability Production Document (CPD) dated 18 May 2006, draft JTE Follow-on System Performance Specification dated 8 Oct 2010 and draft JTE Statement of Objectives, dated 4 Oct 2010 are: (1) produce and test a replacement system that meets the requirements of the JTE CPD, JTE System Performance Specification and available production documents and drawings; (2) re-qualify the updated design, (3) Establish a new production baseline, (4) install and integrate the systems into Primary Training Ranges (PTR), Electronic Scoring Sites (ESS) and Large Force Exercise Ranges (LFER), (5) Interim Contractor Support (ICS) for a limited period (Government's long-term sustainment strategy is organic), (6) Limited field training and support and (7) Complete re-procurement data package. <br /><br />The program office needs to determine the scope of a Follow-on program based on available data package for the number of JTE units identified in the first paragraph to include (1) design, (2) development, (3) test, (4) integration, (5) production, (6) range integration, (7) familiarization training, (8) ICS and (9) re-procurement data package. If another pricing arrangement other than Firm Fixed Price or a combination of pricing arrangements is recommended, the contractor must identify specific tasks with supporting rationale that would not be considered Firm Fixed Price. The responses must clearly identify (with supporting rationale) how they have the ability to meet the Follow-on program requirements without a complete JTE Block 0, Kit 1 technical/software package from the Government. At a minimum, the technical data and software necessary for compatibility with the JTE Increment 1 that cannot be released due to limited and/or restricted rights includes:</p>
<p>- Threat Emitter Unit Signal Generator (CEESIM) software<br />- Range Data Integration Processor components of the Command &amp; Control subsystem software<br />- Mission Situation Awareness Terminal components of the Command &amp; Control subsystem software<br />- Transmitter controller software<br /><br />Request contractor responses to include the following:<br />- Identify if the company is a small-business and/or meets any other unique classification (e.g. 8(A)).<br />- Prior experience in similar industry and/or similar systems<br />- Identify limitations with Government provided technical data package<br />- Describe ability to produce with no quantity limitations <br />- Rationale if another pricing arrangement is recommended<br />- Recommended incentives<br />- Schedule for key activities (PDR, CDR, tests, production unit delivery, etc). Assume production unit delivery based on number of units identified above over a 5 year period.<br />- The maturity of any technologies proposed<br />- Risk reduction efforts used for proposed development, prototype, test and production effort<br />- Lead time for 1st production unit delivery after contract award (1 TEU and 1 mobile C2U)<br />- Program cost estimate (ROM)<br />- Cost of each production unit (TEU, mobile C2U and fixed C2U) from one (1) produced per year, up to eight (8) produced each year with quantity savings, if any.<br />- Clearly identify Development and Production costs (to ensure right color of money is programmed).<br />- Recommended allocation of funds (time-phased over 5 years) with 2nd Qtr 2012 estimated start date.<br />- Technical data rights. Identify any data, hardware or software that would have less than Government purpose rights and a ROM for providing rights on more than what the Government would automatically be entitled to.</p>
<p>Email responses in contractor format with no page limit to the point of contacts listed below. Responses should not require special software programs such as CAD, ICAD, etc to view. Recommend submitting in Microsoft Word, PPT and Excel file format.</p>
<p>Upon request, the program office will release a DVD containing specific JTE Follow-on Program Acquisition and Technical Documentation to include: the Capabilities Production Document (CPD), System Performance Specification (SPS), Statement of Objectives (SOO), Contract Data Requirements List (CDRLs), partial Technical Data Package (drawings, system interface documentation, etc.) previously developed under contract delivery order stated above.

<DESC>This RFI is for market research and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is NOT a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or an announcement of a solicitation. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any potential offeror's ability to submit an offer if a solicitation is released. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The purpose of this document is to identify potential sources, conduct market research, and establish an estimated cost for this potential requirement. Any requests for a solicitation package will be disregarded. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of preparing submissions in response to this RFI and the Government's use of such information. Submittals will not be returned to the sender.<BR><BR>Background <BR>The Rock Island Contracting Center, Army Contracting Command seeks sources that can provide Installation and Maintenance of a Mass Notification System (MNS) in support of Area Support Group (ASG) Kuwait. The purpose of the effort is to provide all the equipment as described below to include; design, installation, and testing of the MNS at seven U.S. Military camps located throughout Kuwait.<BR><BR>Specific Tasks include:<BR>The MNS will provide complete outside coverage at all camps.  Selected Command and Control, Primary Gathering Facilities and billeting areas will also have internal MNS speakers located inside the facility. The primary and alternate base stations will control all MNS components for that camp.  All speaker towers and internal building speakers will be wireless operated.  All Speaker Towers (SPTs) shall run off of solar powered batteries.  All messages, songs, tones shall be audible from a pre-determined distance of up to 300 meters. The MNS must be able to allow user to broadcast a voice message and any alert tones to include four (4) distinct alert tones for:  Ground Attack, NBC Attack, Scud Attack and All Clear.  Primary and Alternate Base Stations will transmit one of four distinct tones and a public test announcement that is clearly audible from the SPT units out to distance coverage of 300 meters (voice and tone).  The SPTs and all control stations perform proper and successful self tests and diagnostics.  All operators of system are fully capable of operating, troubleshooting and maintaining the Mass Notification System (operator/user/administrator level) at the seven camps. All transceivers shall relay signals and extend the systems coverage area maintaining communication continuity. Each wireless transceiver shall have the capability to be programmed to receive up to nine other transceivers and shall be either automatically (in micro-seconds), or manually be directed to reroute signals in the event of a node failure.  This feature shall provide increased reliability and survivability.  In the event that the primary transceiver fails, the signal shall be automatically rerouted through a secondary transceiver.  Other communications equipment operating in or out on this band, in the immediate area, shall not interfere with the MNS.  The MNS shall not interfere with communications (or other) equipment in the area.  The MNS shall not be susceptible to intentional jamming or spoofing by adversaries.

<DESC>A staff ride for the Commanding General, USAREUR/7A, is a senior leader training event of great complexity and will be conducted to high standards in technical, historical, administrative, and support areas.  This staff ride program exists as a critical vehicle by which the CG, USAREUR/7A can train and mentor his senior military and civilian leaders using U.S. Army battles of the First and Second World Wars as a training vehicle.  In addition, the CG, USAREUR/7A utilizes this periodic senior leader training event as a means by which he and the USAREUR/7A senior leaders can engage with fellow senior leaders from other American armed services and from foreign armies whose nations are very important in both the U.S. national and U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) engagement strategies.  These staff rides will not focus on tactical operations but on the important strategic and operational issues (most notably joint and combined operations) which can be examined during the campaigns and battles reviewed on the staff ride.

<DESC>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; National Geospatial Intelligence Agency<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>1. Introduction<br />In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.215-3 Request For Information, The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for the Human Development Management (HDM), is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) as part of market research, to forge a partnership with industry to provide a comprehensive approach to improve the end-to-end processes involved with managing people resources in the organization. <br />This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on part of NGA to acquire any product or services. Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary and any cost associated with submission shall not be reimbursed by the Government. The information requested will be used by NGA to facilitate decision making.</p>
<p>2. Background<br />The NGA Human Development (HD) Directorate was formed in January 2004 with the merger of NGA's Human Resources (HR) and Training and Doctrine (TD) Directorates. This allowed HD to align and integrate its efforts to meet the NGA's Director's Goal to attract, develop and retain a world-class Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) workforce. HD Senior Leadership recognizes the need to align and integrate various services that the new directorate provided. This, would, in turn, allow improved service delivery by introducing more coordinated and efficient business practices, offering more consistent service levels, standardizing processes across the directorate and integrating "people" data. Service integration will also result in resource savings across the board, and assist HD in managing contract services. Currently, HD service functions are provided by the Human Capital Management Contract (HCM).<br />NGA is looking to improve process improvements already in place and working towards integration and optimization through Technology Insertion and Business Process Reengineering for each of the major functional areas: Human Development Management Program Support, Strategic Workforce Planning, Emergency Family Assistance Center (EFAC), Recruitment Services, Personnel Data, Benefits and Retirement Services and Office of Diversity Management and Equal Employment Opportunity. <br />Note: the contractor personnel performing this work at NGA sites must have TS/SCI security clearances and their company must have a TS/SCI facility clearance as per Defense Security Services (DSS) at time of contract award<br />Based on the information received from this RFI, NGA will build a Request for Proposal. At this time NGA is envisioning a single award firm fixed price contract.</p>
<p>3. Responding to this RFI<br />NGA requests that you provide the following information:<br />a. A response no longer than 5 double-sided pages exclusive of existing marketing materials. Only electronic submissions will be accepted. A submission may not be larger than 3MB; if any responsive document is larger than 3 MB, you may send it in more than one submission. Response must contain only UNCLASSIFIED information and be MARKED "UNCLASSIFIED" at least on the first page of the response. No Classified information may be included anywhere in the response. In addition to the response to the RFI (which is a maximum of 5 double-sided pages), you also should provide a 1-2 page response to this acquisition strategy detailing what you see as the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. This information will be used by the government program manager to refine the approach for the final request for proposal.<br />b. Business type (i.e. Woman Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned etc.) and if you will be proposing as prime or subcontractor.<br />c. NAICS code and other suggested NAICS codes<br />d. Proposal interest (would you bid on this requirement?)<br />e. Information that demonstrates you having sufficient staff available to meet these requirements.<br />f. Vendors who provide these services should respond even if they do not provide all the services. If they are unable to provide a particular listed service area, they should describe their niche area.<br />g. Include information that you're aware of FAR Clause 52.219-14, Limitations of Subcontracting.</p>
<p>4. Questions and Comments<br />Respondents may submit questions or comments concerning this RFI, to the World Wide Web site of the Acquisition Research Center (ARC) at https://arc.westfields.net . New users of the ARC must first register (using the "Create New Account" button on the Web page) and obtain a user identifier and password to use for login at the site. Once registered and logged in at the ARC, a user can click and select the "Human Development Management Support" ARC webpage under "Current Efforts".<br />Respondents may submit questions concerning the RFI using the blank website question/answer feature. The Government will entertain questions on a case-by-case basis. Respondents should be advised that all questions submitted to the ARC will be posted for all respondents to view, although the identity of the requesting organization will be withheld.</p>
<p>Questions and comments regarding this RFI will be accepted via only the ARC Web site. Respondents should not directly contact any NGA personnel noted in this RFI. All questions must be submitted by 22 October 2010, 12:00 noon EST. Submissions are due no later than 29 October 29, 2010, 2:00 p.m., EST. Submissions should be sent to Kebra Henderson at kebra.l.henderson@nga.mil and Cassandra Michael at cassandara.l.michael@nga.mil , Lora Mackin at lora.l.mackin@nga.mil</p>

<DESC><strong>Solicitation Number: N61340-11-R-xxxx<br /></strong>Agency: Department of the Navy<br />Office: Naval Air Systems Command<br />Location: Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division<br /><strong>MH-60S Avionics Maintenance Trainers and Weapon Load Trainers/Mission Configuration Trainers Upgrades</strong>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>: The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, FL, is seeking information for potential sources to overhaul, redesign, upgrade, fabricate, integrate, install, deliver and test two (02) MH-60S Avionics Maintenance Trainers (AMT) and upgrade, install and test two (02) Weapon Load Trainers/Mission Configuration trainers (WLT/MCT) and their associated technical documentation, located at NAS North Island, San Diego, CA and NAS Norfolk, VA. The effort is to baseline each trainer's configuration to the latest MH60S System Configuration (AOP 86.x), and to potentially upgrade the devices to subsequent AOPs. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTIFICATION to determine the availability and technical capability of potential offerors to provide the required deliverables.<br /><br />The contractor shall upgrade the two AMTs using the available data and documentation from the similar MH-60R design previously built and delivered, with the objective to maintain software and hardware commonality and life cycle supportability. The Contractor shall upgrade the functionality of the existing AMTs by developing, modifying, and integrating the applicable software modules and hardware design for the MH-60R AMT Device No PNAMT3 to an MH-60S aircraft configuration. This upgrade effort shall produce a training system that will provide realistic, full spectrum maintenance training that provides the operations, functions and equipment necessary to train avionics maintenance personnel to perform organizational level maintenance on the MH60S aircraft. <br /><br />The contractor shall upgrade two WLT/MCT's using available data and documentation to incorporate Organic Airborne Mine Counter Measures (OAMCM) aircraft mission configuration training capability to include the Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS), the Organic Airborne Surface and Influence Sweep (OASIS) and the Airborne Mine Laser Detection Set (ALMDS). Additionally, the WLT/MCT is equipped with the Carriage Stream Tow and Recovery System (CSTRS) that requires upgrading in accordance with Engineering Change Proposal ECP-I-20080002, ECP-I-2010000 and ECP H60-060. Potential exists to add MH-60S Fixed Forward Firing Weapon (MK197 Gun), new Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM), Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) and Hellfire R capabilities to the WLT/MCT. <br /><br />Potential sources should also be aware that there is a potential for a future upgrade from the MH-60S AOP 86.x baseline to an AOP 90 series, and 100 series baseline, plus other additional Joint Weapon Program ECPs.<br />All training events and qualification exercises performed on the training system shall come as close as possible to yielding the same experience as the identical events performed on the aircraft including remove and install (R&amp;I) tasks. Specific trainer enhancements and detailed tasks are identified in the attached document.<br /><br /><strong>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</strong>: The majority of the effort can be completed at the contractor's facility, however future AOP updates will need to be done at the trainer locations. The contractor may be given the option to perform the entire effort at the AMT and WLT/MCT locations. <br /><br /><strong>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</strong>: The AMT and WLT/MCT currently fulfills the Navy training needs by providing a realistic, full spectrum maintenance trainer for electrical, avionics, and armament task areas. All training events and qualification exercises performed on the AMT and the WLT/MCT simulate the actual experience as the identical events performed on the aircraft. The AMT and the WLT/MCT provide training required for personnel unfamiliar with the MH-60S and refresher training for those preparing to deploy.<br /><br /><strong>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES</strong>: Interested parties should provide documentation on their <strong>Capabilities, Experience, and Schedule</strong> that demonstrates ability to fulfill the detailed trainer enhancements and tasks identified in the attached Technical Requirements document. <strong>CAPABILITIES</strong>: Interested parties should provide a brief company introduction and details on the company/organization, including any potential teaming approach and expected percentage of subcontracting required. Discuss your physical capacity for taking on this additional effort, taking into account current workload, and what plans you have if the physical capacity needs to be increased as a result of this proposed effort. Include information on program management, systems engineering, logistic management, requirements management, risks, facilities and personnel, software development plans and processes. Please include your understanding of NAVAIR System Engineering Technical Review (SETR), Testing and Evaluation (T&amp;E) and Information Assurance (IA) processes. Discuss your logistics efforts developing technical documentation, Initial Support System (ISI), Tools and Test Equipment (T&amp;TE), Engineering Data for Provisioning (EDFP), IUID 2-D Data Matrix tags, onsite maintenance and interim contract support. Additionally companies should discuss their understanding of the NAVAIR Risk Management Process and list any ground rules and/or assumptions that your company recommends for this effort i.e. type of contract, estimated period of performance, availability of GFE/GFI, etc. Though this is anticipated to be a Firm Fixed Priced Contract, companies should provide information on company implemented Earned Value Management Systems (EVMS), discussing program management reporting capabilities and feedback regarding availability of EVMS reporting on this contract effort. <strong>EXPERIENCE</strong>: Companies should provide details of their experience in the last 5 years doing similar work and any relevant experience on aircraft maintenance trainer simulation developments. Please provide the contract number, dollar value, period of performance and brief scope of work, <strong>SCHEDULE</strong>: The Government anticipates the AMT 2 and WLT/MCT 2 to be Ready For Training (RFT) between 18-24 months after contract award. The Government further anticipates that AMT 1 and WLT/MCT 1 will be RFT within 12 months of the AMT 2 and WLT/MCT 2 RFT date. The current trainers are used extensively and Government has only one AMT and one WLT on each coast, therefore the Government wants to limit downtime during the upgrade. Companies should describe how they intend to meet the Government's schedule, and provide options and solutions to meet the proposed schedule while limiting trainer downtime.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</strong>: The AMT trainers are not classified, therefore the contractor is not anticipated to have a security classification level to work on the devices; however Information Assurance (IA) requirements must be met. The Government currently has unlimited data rights for the MH-60R AMT baseline, and limited data rights on the MH-60S AMT. Under this effort, the Government will achieve the unlimited data rights under DFARS clause 252.227-7013, Rights in technical data - Noncommercial items, for all devices. <br /><br /><strong>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>

<DESC>Solicitation #: N00024-11-R-4200

PURPOSE:

The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA 05T and the PMS 320 Electric Ships Office) is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) from all potential sources who may be interested in the development and manufacture of variable speed drive (VSD) systems for induction and synchronous machines.  The Navy is interested in understanding what parts of MIL-PRF-32168, Performance Specification for Variable Speed Drive System for Induction and Synchronous Machines dated July 27, 2004, are cost-drivers and to determine if it would be beneficial to modify the standard to enable the VSDs to be more affordable.

No formal Request for Proposal (RFP) or other types of solicitation will be issued.
  Follow-up questions may be asked of responders for clarification, but this will not indicate a selection or preference.  Reponses to this notice will be used for market research by the NAVSEA and the Electric Ships Office (ESO) to determine industry capabilities, cost drivers, and recommendations for the purpose of updating MIL-PRF-32168 of July 27, 2004.

Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.
  All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or other solicitation, if any is issued.

DESCRIPTION:

MIL-PRF-32168, Performance Specification for Variable Speed Drive System for Induction and Synchronous Machines was issued on July 27, 2004.  Additionally, MIL-DTL-17060G(SH) was issued 8 January 2009 with additional guidance on motors to be utilized with VSD systems.  Since the issue of MIL-PRF-32168, industry has only offered a limited number of products meeting this specification and the Navy has procured only a limited number of products to this specification.  Affordability and the technical challenges in meeting this performance specification are considered to be the significant barriers to a wider adoption of VSDs.
  Past studies have shown that VSDs can provide significant fuel savings for naval ships; hence the Navy is very interested in a better understanding of the barriers to their adoption.  MIL-PRF-32168 is available online at https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/.

RESPONSES:

This RFI is soliciting information that can be used to revise MIL-PRF-32168 to enable more vendors to produce conforming products at a lower cost.  Specifically, NAVSEA and the ESO are looking for information on the following:

a.  Specific requirements in MIL-PRF-32168 that are technically challenging or require significant modification of commercially available VSDs.

b.  Specific requirements in MIL-PRF-32168 that drive acquisition cost.

c.
  Specific requirements in MIL-PRF-32168 that negatively impact reliability or total ownership cost.

d.  Recommendations for changes to MIL-PRF-32168.  Indicate which text (if any) should be deleted and what text (if any, and where) should be added.  NOTE: MIL-DTL-17060G(SH) was issued 8 January 2009 with additional guidance on motors to be utilized with VSD systems, and information contained therein may be of use.   

NAVSEA requests your responses be submitted by December 31, 2010.  Submissions will be accepted after this date, but feedback may not be as timely or contribute to NAVSEAs strategic planning.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned. The ESO and NAVSEA prefer that the letters be nonproprietary.
  Information provided shall be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider.  However, recommendations provided for proposed changes to MIL-PRF-32168 must be non-proprietary for the Government to incorporate them into a future revision of MIL-PRF-32168.  Classified material will not be accepted.  NAVSEA may request further information regarding the capabilities of respondents to meet the requirements and may request a presentation and/or a site visit as deemed necessary.

Information should be e-mailed to Dr. Norbert Doerry at norbert.doerry@navy.mil or mailed to Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Dr.
 Norbert Doerry, NAVSEA 05T, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue SE, Washington Navy Yard, D.C. 20376 and labeled with the solicitation number and Variable Speed Drive Product Market Questionnaire.  Questions can be submitted electronically to norbert.doerry@navy.mil or by phone at (202) 781-2520.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334220- Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing. (Small Business size standard is 750 employees)
<p><br />DESCRIPTION:<br />The Global Positioning System (GPS) Wing (GPSW) at the Los Angeles Air Force Base (LAAFB) Space and Missile System Center (SMC) intends to host Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) Technical Interchange Meetings (TIMs) and Specification Working Groups (SWGs) in development of the Technical Requirements Document.</p>
<p>Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM) sessions will be held from 25-29 October 2010. TIM sessions will be held 25 Oct 2010 (Monday) from 1200 to 1600 PST and held all other days from 0800 to 1600 at SAIC, 300 N. Sepulveda Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245-4485. SWG sessions will subsequently be held 16-18 November 2010.</p>
<p>SWG sessions will be held from 0800 to 1600 each day at the SAIC facility. All meetings will be conducted in Conference Room 2060 with provision for teleconference and Data Exchange support.</p>
<p>The goal of MGUE is to develop, integrate, and produce M-code capable; GPS receivers for the designated lead service platforms specified in the draft MGUE Capability Development Document dated 15 December 2009. These platforms encompass Air (e.g. F-15E, Precision Guided Munitions), Ground (Raven, Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV)) and Maritime (Arleigh-Burke Class Destroyer (DDG)) domains, as well as a new military handheld unit with modernized GPS capability and improved human-machine interface features.</p>
<p>Under the emerging MGUE acquisition strategy, the GPSW is considering awarding contracts for the development and certification of production ready GPS receiver form factor cards for the Raven, EFV, F-15E, and DDG platforms that leverage existing technologies to the maximum extent to reduce development risks and to establish options for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase. Upon successful certification and operational tests/assessments, the GPSW intends to exercise options for Low-Rate Initial Production for these form factors. Finally, the GPSW intends to pursue an Offeror specified production ready Common GPS Module that can be integrated into handheld receivers. To ensure functionality, demonstrations will be conducted that show case the compatibility and the enhanced capabilities of a CGM integrated handheld.</p>
<p>The GPSW is particularly interested in feedback from prospective prime contractors to ensure the most appropriate document relevance and feasibility. Preliminary Industry discussion will be initially facilitated by two MGUE TIM meetings. Each TIM will focus upon a collaborative review of TRD/PP aviation and maritime requirements.</p>
<p>MGUE TIM #1 will provide an overview of the most current Aviation Maritime Technical Requirements Document (TRD) and companion Protection Profile (PP) "draft" documents.</p>
<p>MGUE TIM #2 will provide an overview of the most current Ground Embedded TRD and companion PP "draft" documents.</p>
<p>Subsequently, two Specification Working Group (SWG) meetings will address both platform stakeholder and industry TIM session comments.</p>
<p>MGUE SWG #1 will provide an in depth discussion of the Aviation Maritime TRD/PP requirements as they have evolved from the previous TIM #1.</p>
<p>MGUE SWG #2 will provide an in depth discussion of the Ground Embedded TRD/PP requirements as they have evolved from the previous TIM #2.</p>
<p>MGUE SWG #3 will provide a forum to address additional Industry comments and concerns. Provision will be made to accommodate one-on-one sessions with Industry to address potentially proprietary concerns.</p>
<p>The GPSW intends to publicize all recommended changes that could affect revisions to the Request for Proposal (RFP). If your contractor team would like to participate in these TIMs and/or SWGs, please make an appointment as instructed below.

The accreditation services are in the fields of biological, chemical, and calibration standards for their National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, IA and Orient Point, NY.
<p>The accreditation body will assess, audit, and accredit the National Veterinary Services Laboratories Quality Management System as well as the veterinary diagnostic testing program, the proficiency test production and provider program, the reference material program and the National Center for Animal Health Calibration Laboratory.</p>
<p>The scope of this effort is to complete an audit and assessment to expand and continue the ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation in each of the four diagnostic laboratories of the NVSL and the National Center for Animal Health Calibration Laboratory to determine that the facilities are performing scope analyses and support activities in accordance with the most current version of International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) Standard 17025, and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Quality Standard and Guidelines for Veterinary Laboratories: Infectious Diseases and the laboratory quality system, policies and procedures. The NVSL will further expand accreditation to include:</p>
<p>&bull; ISO/IEC 17043, "Conformity assessment - General requirements for Proficiency Testing" - This standard specifies general requirements for the competence of providers of proficiency testing schemes and for the development and operation of proficiency testing schemes.</p>
<p>&bull; ISO Guide 34:2000, "General Requirements for the Competence of Reference Material Producers" - This guide specifies general requirement in accordance with which a reference material producer has to demonstrate that it operates, if it is to be recognized as competent to carry out the production of reference materials.</p>
<p>The USDA, APHIS intends to award a firm fixed price contract with an estimated value of $300,000.00. The contract will include a base year with the option to extend the contract for an additional four (4) years.</p>
<p><br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Therefore, this sole source award is being made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other company will satisfy agency requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. All proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Any inquires to this sole source acquisition must be submitted in writing to the attention of Corinne Nygren at USDA, APHIS Contracting, Butler Square, 5th Floor, 100 North Sixth Street, Minneapolis, MN 55403, fax 612-336-3550 or by email to Corinne.Nygren@aphis.usda.gov.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the US Army  Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (ARIEM), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: NTT Systems, Inc., North York, Ontario, Canada M5M 2S1.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <BR><BR>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <BR><BR>RESPONSES WILL BE USED FOR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ONLY.<BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>The Military Nutrition Division conducted a study to determine if the dietary amino acid tyrosine can be used in special rations designed for use during high stress military operations. A series of studies will determine if supplemenlation with tyrosine will mitigate cognitive deficits and adverse effects on mood, such as fatigue, produced by severe military psychological stress. Statistical and data analysis are required for a large data set collected during the administration of the first phase of USARIEM Protocol H06"05. The data collected consists of behavioral tests and physiological measures such as heart rate, respiration and skin temperature.<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>Complex statistical analysis of the nature requested requires extensive familiarly of software previously provided by NTT Systems to USARIEM for assessment and data reduction and preliminary analysis of a variety of behavioral/cognitive parameters including cognitive performance and mood state.

<DESC>Community AnnouncementSolicitation for NASA Science Team Members for ESAs Euclid MissionThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate(SMD) intends to release a solicitation for NASA-selected members of the Science Team forESAs Euclid mission for dark energy research.	This solicitation will be released as anamendment to the Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences 2010 (ROSES-2010)NASA Research Announcement (NRA).OVERVIEW OF THE EUCLID OPPORTUNITY It is anticipated that the Euclid solicitation will invite proposals for NASA PrincipalInvestigator (PI)-led science investigations using ESAs Euclid mission.  The selected PIwill serve on the Euclid Science Team and have full data rights to the Euclid flightdata.  The development of flight hardware and ground-system software will not besolicited in the solicitation.	Participation in this solicitation will be open to allcategories of organizations (domestic and non-U.S., but excluding organizations from ESAmember states), including educational, industrial, and not-for-profit organizations,Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), University AffiliatedResearch Centers (UARCs), NASA Centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and otherGovernment agencies.  Principal Investigators are responsible for and allowed to assembleinvestigation teams from any and all of these organizations.As of the release of this announcement, NASA and ESA are continuing to discuss thepotential for a strategic collaboration on the Euclid mission.	NASA participation willdepend upon the outcome of decisions informed by an assessment of the proposed ESA-NASAEuclid collaboration.  NASA reserves the right to defer selection decisions, to make noselections, or to terminate selected investigations.THE EUCLID MISSION The Euclid Consortium has determined the science and observational requirements andinstrumentation capabilities for Euclid, which will include the Baryon AcousticOscillation and Weak Lensing techniques for measuring the properties of dark energy andother cosmological parameters. The solicitation will describe a Euclid Reference Mission design that demonstrates theexistence of a configuration that meets the science goals, as well as Euclidsprogrammatic constraints, to which proposers must strictly adhere in the proposal ofscience investigations.  The Euclid Reference Mission will include a visible-light imagerand a near-infrared spectrograph / photometer.	It is anticipated that, subsequent toselection of the Euclid Science Team, the Euclid design may evolve slightly from theEuclid Reference Mission.DETAILS OF THE PLANNED SOLICITATION It is anticipated that the solicitation will solicit two types of proposals:(1) an investigation led by a Euclid Survey Scientist with expertise in at least one ofthe major methods for dark energy research; and(2) an investigation led by an Instrument Scientist for the Near-Infrared Spectrograph /Photometer with expertise in infrared photometry, especially infrared photometry fromspace.The PIs of the proposals selected under this solicitation will become members of theEuclid Science Team and will be expected to participate fully in all aspects of the workof the Euclid Science Team.In common with all other Euclid Consortium members, all members of the selected scienceinvestigation teams will have proprietary access to Euclid data for the execution oftheir proposed science investigation.It is anticipated that proposals for Euclid science investigations may offer or requestsupport for ground-based observations, with the requirement that such ground-basedobservations contribute to the specific Euclid science investigation proposed.	It isanticipated that proposals will be evaluated firstly on their use of Euclid data inconjunction with Stage III priors as defined by the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM)Figure of Merit Science Working Group (FoMSWG).  Proposers will be further allowed toinclude additional ground-based data (other than the Stage III priors defined by theFoMSWG) in order to improve the figure of merit of their proposal; these additionalground-based data may include anticipated data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope(LSST).It is anticipated that the solicitation will contain an aggregate science investigationfunding profile over the life cycle of the Euclid mission.  Approximately $20M of fundingto support Phase E prime science operations for each investigation is expected to ramp uproughly two years prior to launch as appropriate support personnel are assigned to theproject, and to continue until one year after the expected ~4-year prime science phase. Up to 10% of such funds may be used towards ground-based support observations.	Proposerswill be required to include in their proposals a work plan and budget profile, and thiswill be assessed as part of the evaluation.It is anticipated that Euclid data, including suitable calibration and processing tools,will be made available to the public one year following data acquisition.The following schedule describes the anticipated major milestones of NASAs Euclidsolicitation.  These dates are subject to change.  Solicitation Release as a ROSES-2010 Amendment:  Mid-Oct 2010Notice of Intent (NOI) to propose Due Date:  Release + 4 weeksProposal Due Date:  Release + 2 monthsSelections Announced (target):	Release + 4 months The issuance of this Community Announcement does not obligate NASA to issue the Euclidsolicitation and solicit proposals.  Any costs incurred by prospective investigators inpreparing submissions in response to this Community Announcement are incurred completelyat the submitter's own risk.  The Euclid solicitation may contain provisions that differfrom this announcement, in which case those in the solicitation will take precedence.Questions or comments about this Community Announcement on NASAs Euclid solicitation maybe addressed to the NASA Euclid Program Scientist:  Dr. Richard Griffiths, AstrophysicsDivision, Science Mission Directorate, National Aeronautics and Space Administration,Washington, DC 20546-0001; E-mail: Richard.E.Griffiths@nasa.gov; Phone: 202-358-1605. Comments should be provided to Dr. Griffiths within 1 week of this posting in order to beconsidered in the solicitation.  The character string "Euclid Solicitation" (withoutquotes) should be included in the subject line of all transmissions.

<p>The ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrument offers two major capabilities that the NIST Applied Genetics Group requires for our research in the forensic DNA and clinical healthcare communities. This instrument will be needed for both fragment analysis (human identification and clinical DNA processing) and DNA sequencing.</p>
<p>First, the instrument is the ONLY capillary electrophoresis instrument with six fluorescent dye detection. Currently, the state of art CE instruments can only detect five fluorescent dyes. As part of our multiplex STR research and development, we have developed and validated STR assays using multiplex STR assays. By adding a sixth dye, we can greatly increase the number of markers assayed. The second major need for this instrument is the integration of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. The 3500 instrument is the ONLY capillary instrument that uses this technology. All consumable reagents used on the 3500 CE instrument are labeled with an RFID tag - the capillary, the polymerase, the anode buffer and the cathode buffer.</p>
<p>Applied Biosystems is the only vendor that offers equipment and services off their GSA schedule that meets our technical requirements. Specifically, no other vendor can provide the AB 3500 Genetic Analyzer. The AB 3500 falls under under Category 66 with sin number 107. The AB 3500 requires open market items not on their GSA schedule, specifically:</p>
<p>1.SW, Genemapper ID-X full v1.2<br />2. 3500 Install kit<br />3.AB Assurance 3500 1pm<br />4. SW Sequencing Analysis (Initial License)</p>
<p><br />As a result of the GSA item ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer and its open market items, Applied Biosystems is uniquely qualified to meet the Government's needs. <br /><br />Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (EST) on October 21, 2010. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Christopher.ganey@nist gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>(ii) The public does not have access to information about the compensation of the executives through periodic reports filed under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(a), 78o(d)) or section 6104 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. (To determine if the public has access to the compensation information, see the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission total compensation filings at http://www.sec.gov/answers/execomp.htm.)</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer, by the end of the month following the month of a first-tier subcontract with a value of $25,000 or more, and annually thereafter, the Contractor shall report the names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated executives for each first-tier subcontractor for the subcontractor's preceding completed fiscal year at http://www.fsrs.gov, if--</p>
<p>(i) In the subcontractor's preceding fiscal year, the subcontractor received--</p>
<p>(A) 80 percent or more of its annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and</p>

(To determine if the public has access to the compensation information, see the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission total compensation filings at http://www.sec.gov/answers/execomp.htm.)</p>
<p>(d)(1) If the Contractor in the previous tax year had gross income, from all sources, under $300,000, the Contractor is exempt from the requirement to report subcontractor awards.</p>
<p>(2) If a subcontractor in the previous tax year had gross income from all sources under $300,000, the Contractor does not need to report awards to that subcontractor.</p>
<p>(e) Phase-in of reporting of subcontracts of $25,000 or more.</p>

<p><br />52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)</p>
<p>(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>
<p>(1) The solicitation number;</p>
<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>
<p>(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;</p>
<p>(5) Terms of any express warranty;</p>
<p>(6) Price and any discount terms;</p>
<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>
<p>(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);</p>
<p>(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;</p>
<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>
<p>(i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation. (1)(i) The GSA Index of Federal Specifications, Standards and Commercial Item Descriptions, FPMR Part 101-29, and copies of specifications, standards, and commercial item descriptions cited in this solicitation may be obtained for a fee by submitting a request to--GSA Federal Supply Service Specifications Section, Suite 8100, 470 East L'Enfant Plaza, SW, Washington, DC <br />20407, Telephone (202) 619-8925, Facsimile (202) 619-8978.</p>

<p>(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all offers exceeding $3,000, and offers of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority. <br />Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is "not dominant in its field of operation" when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity. <br />(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: <br />(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. <br />(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. <br />(3) For long-term contracts- <br />(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and <br />(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter. <br />(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/. <br />(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees. <br />(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. <br />(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. <br />(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed: <br />The Contractor represents that it o is, o is not a small business concern under NAICS Code __332911___________ assigned to contract number ______________. <br />[Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title].</p>

Clarification for CLINS 0002, 0004, 0006, 0008, and 0010: the vendor is allowed a one-time fee for compliance with Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR).  Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The contractor is required to completely complete all the information in the format using the following web address:  https://cmra.mil. Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 Sep of each government fiscal year. IMPORTANT!!! Information must be reported within 30 business days after the completion of each course and before the submission of any invoices, whichever timeframe is first. The following provisions apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotations are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued under Request for Quotation (RFQ) number W912LP-11-Q-0002.  All proposals shall reference the RFQ number and shall be submitted by 8:00 a.m. local time on 22 October 2010. The anticipated award date is 26 October 2010. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses for commercial items in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-46 dated 29 September 2010.  This acquisition is open for Full & Open Competition. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 611519 size standard of $7.0m. Contract line item numbers and quantities: CLIN 0001, Base Year (FY 11) Highway Drug Investigations for Patrol, 14 course iterations; CLIN 0002, CMR Reporting for Base Year (FY 11); CLIN 0003, Option Year #1 (FY 12) Highway Drug Investigations for Patrol, 14 course iterations; CLIN 0004, CMR Reporting for Option Year #1 (FY 12); CLIN 0005, Option Year #2 (FY 13) Highway Drug Investigations for Patrol, 14 course iterations; CLIN 0006, CMR Reporting for Option Year #2 (FY 13); CLIN 0007, Option Year #3 (FY 14) Highway Drug Investigations for Patrol, 14 course iterations; CLIN 0008, CMR Reporting for Option Year #3 (FY 14); CLIN 0009, Option Year #4 (FY 15) Highway Drug Investigations for Patrol, 14 course iterations; CLIN 0010, CMR Reporting for Option Year #4 (FY 15); Vendors shall review the Statement of Work for a detailed list of course requirements and items to be submitted as part of their proposal.  The prices provided for each of the SUB CLIN above shall include all labor, material, travel costs, supervision, and associated services to carry out the Midwest Counterdrug Training Centers (MCTC) mission requirements as defined in the Statement of Work.  Clarification for CLINS 0002, 0004, 0006, 0008, and 0010: the vendor is allowed a one-time fee for compliance with Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR); the vendor may apply a price to the CMR CLINs or may opt to complete the mandatory reporting at no cost to the Government. However, as a clear indicator of vendors intention, CLIN pricing must reflect a  zero  cost if vendor chooses to waive the CMR Reporting fee. Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will  drive  your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.   The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The contractor is required to completely complete all the information in the format using the following web address:  https://cmra.mil. Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 Sep of each government fiscal year. IMPORTANT!!! Information must be reported within 30 business days after the completion of each course and before the submission of any invoices, whichever timeframe is first. The following provisions apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items.  The Government will award a firm-fixed priced contract resulting from this solicitation, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be Best Value to the Government. Best Value is the most advantageous offer, price and other factors considered with the Governments stated importance of evaluation criteria. The Technical factors will include Course Content and Materials and Instructor Qualifications. Technical and Past Performance when combined, are significantly more important than Price. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions, therefore, Offerors initial proposal should contain the Offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.

Clarification for CLINS 0002, 0004, 0006, 0008, and 0010: the vendor is allowed a one-time fee for compliance with Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR); the vendor may apply a price to the CMR CLINs or may opt to complete the mandatory reporting at no cost to the Government. However, as a clear indicator of vendors intention, CLIN pricing must reflect a zero cost if vendor chooses to waive the CMR Reporting fee.   Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The contractor is required to completely complete all the information in the format using the following web address:  https://cmra.mil. Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 Sep of each government fiscal year. IMPORTANT!!! Information must be reported within 30 business days after the completion of each course and before the submission of any invoices, whichever timeframe is first. The following provisions apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision) <br /><br />52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items (JUN 2008)<br />52.212-2 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items. (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />Technical Capability<br />Delivery<br />Price<br />Technical capability and delivery are significantly more important than price. Award will be granted to the offeror that provides the Best Value to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (AUG 2009). <br />ALT I (APR 2002)<br />An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) through (i) of this provision.<br />52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items (JUN 2010)</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695. <br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 14 September 2010, 10:00 a.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 14 September 2010.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.50 per hour or $140.00 per week or $606.67 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Proposals must be received not later than 19 OCT 2010, 11:00 A.M. Local California time. Proposals received after the date and time specified will not be considered. Proposals may be submitted as an attachment to an e-mail addressed to: Brenda.l.lentz@uscg.mil .</p>

<p><br />OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No.DTRT57-10-Q-80125 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13.5 and Part 12. This solicitation document and incorporated clauses/provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-43 dated August 8, 2010 and FAC 2005-44 dated July 8, 2010. The NAICS Code is 33411 and the Small Business size standard is 1,000. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Contract on a competitive basis to a Certified Hubzone Small Business. Note: Vendors are required to provide a price for all CLINS 0001-0012. <br />Background
<p>The Volpe Center has supported the FAA Air Traffic Organization - Advanced Technology Development and Prototyping Group (AT0-P) organization for over ten years for development, prototyping and evaluation of air traffic management systems for the airport surface and terminal environments. ATO-P is currently preparing for the installation of a Surface Decision Support System (SDSS) at the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center in Atlantic City, NJ.</p>
<p>As part of the Volpe Center's continuing support for SDSS evaluation, ATO-P requires the procurement of hardware to build the required SDSS architecture.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to purchase commercial IT hardware equipment with the salient specifications as stated in CLINs 0001-0012 (listed below) whose quote offers the Government the lowest price.</p>
<p>Equipment Branding Compatibility <br />Each equipment category described in CLINs 0001 through 0008 must be compatible. Equipment family compatibility is important. Each equipment category can be of a different brand, but no mixing of brand will be accepted within each category itself.</p>
<p>The inter-mix of brands within the categories described in CLINs 0001 through 0008 can cause compatibility issues. This situation that can be averted if the equipment proposed for each category is within the same family brand. Also, there are advantages that can be drawn from within a single family of products. Different brands have features that are available only if interconnected with other devices of the same brand.</p>

<SUBJECT>A-10 Wing Replacement Program Initial Spares for Enhanced Wing Assembly
<SOLNBR>FA8202WRP_Initial_Spares
<RESPDATE>101510
<CONTACT>Nathan Toole, Phone 8017778414, Email nathan.toole@hill.af.mil - Sherry Eldridge, Contract Specialist, Phone 8017752396, Email sherry.eldridge@hill.af.mil
<DESC>This notification is for market research purposes only to identify potential contractors who have the skills, tooling, equipment, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill Air Force Base, Utah, and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished. This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid.
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>This effort is to manufacture Initial Spare Parts for the A-10 Enhanced Wing Assembly (EWA). Contractor will manufacture and supply spare parts to the Air Force supply chain so they will be available to support EWA unique requirements from initial fielding of the first wing until the Air Force and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) provisioning efforts can fulfill the spare requirements.</p>
<p>Based on FAR 6.302-1(a)(iii) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, it is the intent for this to be a sole source effort with The Boeing Company due to the duplication of costs and delay in schedule&nbsp;for the required tooling. <br /><br />QUALIFICATION STATEMENT:</p>
<p>The Air Force requires EWA unique parts to support initial flying operations and testing of the new wing prior to provisioning efforts being completed and implemented. Therefore, this acquisition will be a contract to assure the short-term supportability of the EWA. Requirements for producing EWA parts include the demonstrated capability to manufacture according to 3D modeling information including tight tolerances. This 3D data is still in development and will be provided with short lead times requiring maximum flexibility in producing parts. Contractors will be required to demonstrate verification that 3D data imported to be used for manufacturing exactly matches organic source data. Contractors are also required to submit a technical data package demonstrating their ability to produce or utilize, if they have available, extensive tooling that is unique to the EWA assembly to assure proper end products and mating points/surfaces, and the flexibility to change manufacturing processes should a design change necessitate it. This tooling is estimated to cost contractors an initial investment over $20M and will not be available as GFE during the execution timeframe of this contract. The technical data package must also verify the Contractor's capability to manufacture the parts and qualify first articles. Contractors would also need to demonstrate their ability to deliver parts on a compressed time frame should demand necessitate it. The Contractor will be required to verify capabilities to manage component inventories, develop manufacturing testing (or demonstrate it if in place), and manufacture and test aerospace ready-for-use subassemblies with existing quality processes suitable for military aerospace applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) supply contract with delivery orders to procure initial spares with an anticipated Firm-Fixed-Price arrangement. The base ordering period for this contract will be FY11-FY13 with two one year options to extend in FY14 and FY15.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLES REQUIRED:</p>
<p>&bull;Approximately 137 initial spare parts of varying quantities to establish the pipeline of EWA unique spare parts.</p>
<p>&bull;The effort to produce initial spares has an estimated value of $7.0M with an estimated delivery period from February 2011 to October 2015.</p>
<p>&bull;The Contractor shall establish, implement, and maintain an Initial Spares Program in accordance with the listing of parts</p>
<p>&bull;The Data Item Descriptions (DID) DD Form 1664, and Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRL) DD Form 1423-1.</p>
<p>&bull;When the prime contractor buys end articles or a portion thereof from a vendor/subcontractor, the prime contractor shall impose these specifications upon its vendors/subcontractors. The inclusion of the requirements on contractor's subcontracts/purchase orders to its vendor/subcontractors does not relieve the prime contractor of its obligation to insure timely delivery of the required deliverables.</p>

<DESC>The Library of Congress is issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) on behalf of the National Defense University Library System to procure a new integrated library system to meet shared cataloging and resource needs. The NDU Library System consists of two academic libraries, the National Defense University Library at Ft Leslie J. McNair in Washington DC and the Ike Skelton Library at JFSC in Norfolk, VA. The project will replace the current Horizon software with a commercial off the shelf (COTS) product that will provide access through the web to library holdings, military resources, commercial resources and Internet resources both in the library at each campus and remotely for NDU students, staff, and faculty. The NDU Library manages the library system currently consisting of SirsiDynix Horizon 7.4.x, and Horizon Information Portal 3.0.8. The Horizon ILS supporting two libraries contains 310,000 bibliographic records, 509,000 items records and 6,000 borrowers. On average, 33,000 items are checked out monthly. In addition, the system houses the 171,000 MARC records of the Staff College Automated Military Periodical Index (SCAMPI) database which contains the indexed records from a variety of military and naval periodicals and other resources. The NDU Library currently uses the Ex Libris SFX OpenURL resolver and Metalib federated search, but will be switching to Serials Solutions 360 Services including Link and Search and the Summon Webscale Discovery tool. All responses to this synopsis shall be in writing. No telephone calls will be accepted. For information about the Library of Congress FEDLINK program, please visit www.loc.gov/flicc.

<DESC>Amendment #2
1.	There are no constraints or restrictions regarding the physical locations of the facilities that will be used for providing flight services.  FAA seeks industry input regarding the optimal locations for providing flight services taking into consideration that the FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) and Alaskan Satellite Telecommunication Infrastructure (ASTI) must be utilized for telecommunications services.  These services will be provided as GFE.    
2.	Regarding the operational labor component to be used for MAPS, the FAA plans to continue using federal operational labor in Alaska and contract labor for CONUS operations.  
3.	In 2008, the FAA conducted a study of Flight Services in Alaska.  The objectives of the study were to provide a better understanding of how aviation supports Alaskan communities and the role Flight Services contributes in accommodating aviation users and Alaskan communities. The study results are attached for informational purposes.  No decisions have been made by the FAA as a result of this study.  The FAA plans to conduct an additional service delivery study later this year.  
4.	Requirements for active or passive acknowledgement have not been determined at this time.   This information will be available to industry in a future SIR for MAPS.  
5.	The FAA is aware of the need for Voice Switches in order to provide Flight Services and seeks industry input to determine innovative methodologies for acquiring these services.

Amendment No. 1 Paragraph entitled TIMING AND FORM OF RESPONSES, 5th line, change October 11, 2010 to read, October 25, 2010.
All inquiries concerning this announcement must be directed to Glenn Wilson, Contracting Officer, via email at glenn.a.wilson@faa.gov or at (202) 385-7730. 
This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) regarding the Meteorological and Aeronautical Planning System (MAPS) program.  The responses to this market survey will be used for information purposes only.  
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR OFFER. THIS IS NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR).  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
INTRODUCTIONThis RFI is an announcement regarding the Meteorological and Aeronautical Planning System (MAPS) Program. The purpose of this RFI is to post a summary table of the MAPS' Preliminary Shortfall Analysis Report and elicit specific information regarding potential solutions that will address the required MAPS enhancements.Flight Services are currently provided by four separate contract vehicles. Preflight assistance and Inflight Advisory services in Alaska are provided by government employees using a leased automation system called the Operational and Supportability Implementation System (OASIS).  Preflight and Inflight support for the Continental United States (CONUS), Hawaii and Puerto Rico are currently provided by contract labor using a vendor-owned automation system called Flight Services through the 21st Century (FS21).  Additionally, there are two internet pilot web portals which enable pilots to self-brief and file/amend flight plans.  These systems are known as Direct User Access Terminal Services (DUAT/S. The term DUAT-Replacement (DUAT-R) is used to refer to the current contracts. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that the best interest of the government and the aviation community would be served by integrating Alaska and CONUS requirements into a single platform to be deployed NAS-wide and the acquisition of this new platform will be best served by conducting a full and open competition.  
This RFI addresses the Flight Service automation requirements, along with the internet capabilities. The first contract delivery release would be deployed in the 2014-2015 timeframe.   
The FAA is especially interested in increased communications capabilities, internet and SWIM compliant systems with shared database technology based on industry experience with previously developed air traffic and flight service automation and voice systems. The FAA seeks to understand current and proposed industry capabilities to meet the requirements, the ability to meet the proposed deployment schedule including the acquisition strategy, and any suggestions that would further enhance safety and service delivery. The FAA also solicits recommendations or opinions as to the CONUS operational labor component and how best to structure the contract or contracts to meet the need for contract operational support in the CONUS. 
At this time, the FAA is not prepared to address service delivery locations.  This information will be provided in later Market Surveys or Screening Information Requests (SIRs).
Based upon the findings of this RFI, the FAA plans to release either a draft SIR for Industry comment or a formal SIR for Industry response or conduct an Industry Day. 
Proposed MAPS ENHANCEMENTS The impact of the service enhancements envisioned for MAPS will be a decrease in the number of general aviation (GA) aircraft accidents.  There is a direct correlation between a general aviation pilot not receiving a preflight weather briefing and/or en route updates and the occurrence of a weather-related aircraft accident.  In addition, this system will enhance post accident survivability by reducing search area and promoting a faster response by emergency services personnel. Currently both initial contact and subsequent contact depend on the pilot initiating the call to the FSS.  If the pilot does not call, important information pertinent to flight safety may not reach them.  This antiquated, customer contact-dependent "pull" model continues today.  As a result, pilots often do not receive safety-related information because they either do not or can not call Flight Service, or they call too late for the information to be of benefit. The MAPS solution is to augment the "pull" model by adding a "push" component, i.e., automatic update capability, to the system.  While pilots would continue to initiate services, automation would "push" critical updates to the pilot in time for them to make rational, safety-related decisions about their flight.  These automatic updates would be provided at no-cost to the pilot.  The system would only send advisory information pertinent to the route of flight, before or during its operation, and would eliminate redundant information.  This system would be built around an integrated global database network to provide NAS-consistent information, relative to current aircraft position, and accessible through Internet connectivity.  Direct contact with Flight Service Specialists will be provided when the system will not accept a specific flight plan or when the pilot requires clarification or technical assistance in preflight planning and filing.  Preflight support will remain available via phone, radio or by the new 'Internet text chat' function.  Flight planning issues will be resolved quickly because the same source information will be seen by both pilot and Specialist, i.e, an integrated, interactive pilot web portal.
As currently envisioned by the FAA, MAPS services will be net-centric, and therefore widely available and with more current data. Not all enhancements are addressed in this document but several significant capabilities should illustrate the anticipated safety benefits of the new system. For example, a pilot could receive a text and/or graphics-based weather brief in the cockpit while warming up their engine on the ramp rather than relying on an hours-old brief obtained before departure. Also many pilots are reluctant to file Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flight plans out of concern that they may forget to close a flight plan and trigger a SAR false alarm.  Since MAPS will include an automatic reminder to close fight plans in addition to other enhancements, it is anticipated that a substantial increase in the number of pilots who file flight plans, receive weather briefings and fly will benefit from the increased situational awareness afforded by MAPS.
The web-based flight planning system, including an identical interface for pilot and Specialist, will ensure a shared situational awareness of the flight and the conditions expected to be encountered for the planned route.  MAPS will also provide applicable airspace restrictions and traffic management information.  Pilots will be able to enter their personal level of risk tolerance for a specific flight, e.g., highest acceptable intensity of turbulence, lowest layer of cloud cover and/or lowest visibility desired, probability of encounter, etc. This decision support tool will enable general aviation pilots and Flight Service Specialists to more accurately determine the impact of weather hazards upon their flight. Shared situational awareness and the integration of weather into decision support tools are key capabilities in the NextGen Concept of Operations.
Frequently-used flight plans, pilot contact  information, pilot preferences and aircraft capabilities will be stored in the MAPS system and may be used to auto populate flight plans.  After specifying the route of flight, aviation weather and aeronautical information will be accessed and provided in a standardized format from the FAA's authoritative sources.  Pilots will also be able to self-brief and/or download meteorological information as part of the flight plan briefing function.  Graphical, textual, and grid formats will be available.  Once the preflight briefing is complete, the pilot can subscribe to receive automatic information updates that occur after flight plan filing or post briefing, including items such as destination airport and alternate airport closures, new advisories for icing, turbulence, thunderstorms, etc.Once the flight plan has been filed in the system, critical changes to current or forecast meteorological and aeronautical information, e.g., urgent PIREPs, a new Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET), destination and alternate airport changes to/from IFR, TFRs, etc., will be sent automatically to pilots who subscribe to this free service and the condition impacts their planned flight.  These weather deltas will be provided as alerts to the pilot in a format chosen by the end-user. PIREP entry will be simplified, standardized in form, and easily accessed through voice-to-text capability.
Likewise, any critical aeronautical advisory changes in the NAS impacting the route of flight will also be generated automatically and forwarded to the pilot.  These deltas would include new or updated NOTAMs, destination and alternate airport closure, and TFRs that are applicable to the route of flight. Voice-to-text and text-to-voice capability will be available to minimize head down time for the pilot and increase situational awareness.  
Limiting Inflight communications to critical changes in aeronautical and meteorological information will reduce frequency congestion and alleviate the potential repetition of information that a pilot has previously received.  The automation system will also alert the Specialist if an automatic update cannot be sent or if it is rejected as undeliverable. Details of the active or passive acknowledgement processes will be determined after market survey during final requirements development.  
Pilots will be alerted to deviations from the filed flight plan and prompted to either return to the filed route of flight or amend the plan remotely.  This will reduce the number of deviation alerts sent to the Specialist and greatly reduce search and rescue response times.
The system will create a repository of information on VFR flight operations and track the flight planning services provided to those flights.  This transaction tracking capability will also automate the current En Route Flight Advisory Service (EFAS), enhance situational awareness for the support of SAR, and alleviate the necessity of re-transmitting information that has already been received by the pilot.  The system will maintain an accessible log all transactions.
Pilots may request flight plan monitoring. The system would then perform conformance monitoring and generate an alert to the pilot and the Specialist when an aircraft is out of conformance with its flight plan, allowing the pilot to amend the flight plan or return to the original route of flight. The intent is not to develop a separate flight plan tracker, but rather to request Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) information on VFR flights relative to their intended route of flight, using existing interfaces with En Route and Terminal automation.  
When the Specialist has a Radio Contact, he/she will enter the aircraft's Call Sign into MAPS and the system will identify any missing information required for a given flight. MAPS will allow any Specialist to see all information relevant to the flight and the information already provided to the pilot in a distinct format.   A logical outgrowth of the flight plan monitoring capability would be to expedite SAR operations using ADS-B location information. Initiating a SAR operation based on improved location data from aircraft (that are equipped with ADS-B and monitored by MAPS automation) will enable SAR operations to target search areas quickly and efficiently and thus greatly increase the probability of detection.  The search area will be greatly reduced which in turn will allow the search to be concentrated over a smaller area increasing the chances of finding a downed aircraft and improve post-accident survival rates.

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>Question #1  What are the actual data source formats for these five listed "databases" (i.e. DB2, Oracle, other)?
Government Response: File information is available on each database website:1)	SSA Death Master File - http://www.ntis.gov/products/ssa-quarterly.aspx2)	GSA Excluded Parties List System - https://www.epls.gov/epls/search.do?status=current3)	Department of Treasury Debt Check Database -                http://www.fms.treas.gov/news/factsheets/debtcheck.html4)	HUD Credit Alert System  - http://www.nls.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/sys/caivrs/caivrs_faq.cfm5)	HHS List of Excluded Individuals/Entities - http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/exclusions/exclusions_list.asp
The NBC currently does not have detailed formats for the required sources.  It is expected that the vendor will possess and provide familiarity with these data bases.  

Question #2  Are connections to these five databases currently available to NBC?  
Government Response: Connectivity to these databases does not currently exist at the NBC.  The vendor is required to assist the NBC with connectivity requirements. It is important to note, the NBC has concerns with the types of connections and security used to interface with these sources.  All connectivity must utilize FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) 140-2 encryption. 

Question #3:  Why is CCR not listed as a database to check?
Government Response: Presidential memo does not list CCR, therefore, CCR is not currently part of the requirement.

Question #4:  Where does the "Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS)" - Location, agency and data source type - currently reside?
Government Response:  
General Info:  The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of 2009 (Public Law 110-417) was enacted on October 14, 2008. Section 872 of this Act required the development and maintenance of an information system that contains specific information on the integrity and performance of covered Federal agency contractors and grantees. The Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) was developed to address these requirements. FAPIIS is a distinct application that is accessed through the Past Performance Information System (PPIRS) and is available to federal acquisition professionals for their use in award and responsibility determinations. FAPIIS provides users access to integrity and performance information from the FAPIIS reporting module in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), proceedings information from the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and suspension/disbarment information from the Excluded Parties List system (EPLS).
Agency - DOD
Location:  Naval Sea Systems Command Detachment Portsmouth, PO Box 2058, Portsmouth, NH 03804-2058
NAVSEALOGCEN DET PORTSMOUTH is the FAPIIS Central Design Activity that develops, designs, and maintains the FAPIIS application.

Question #5:  What is the actual data source format for FFS (i.e. Database, DB2 (z/OS?, Linux, UNIX, Windows?), Oracle, other)?
Government Response:   CICS VSAM

Question #6:  What is the actual data source format for FBMS (i.e. Database, DB2 (z/OS?, Linux, UNIX, Windows?), Oracle, other)?
Government Response:   SAP Oracle

Question #7:  In the RFI, it references "Data volumes in excess of 10 million records per day are to be expected" - where does this data volume come from?
Government Response:  This estimated volume comes from the five data base systems being monitored by the software along with client specific data.  

Question #8:   When source data must be corrected as the result of an exception, which source data is being corrected? For example, does the DNP system correct its own local data or the source data at SSA/DHHS/GSA/Treasury/etc.?
Government Response:  The software will analyze the exceptions and those exceptions should be resolved in the DNP system software.

Question #9:  Please clarify 'best-practice library of analytics".  What is expected to be contained in the "best practice library of analytics"?
Government Response:  We are currently looking for a software tool that has pre-built rules that match the DNP system.

<DESC><strong>Solicitation Number: N61340-11-R-xxxx<br /></strong>Agency: Department of the Navy<br />Office: Naval Air Systems Command<br />Location: Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division<br /><strong>MH-60S Avionics Maintenance Trainers and Weapon Load Trainers/Mission Configuration Trainers Upgrades</strong>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>: The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, FL, is seeking information for potential sources to overhaul, redesign, upgrade, fabricate, integrate, install, deliver and test two (02) MH-60S Avionics Maintenance Trainers (AMT) and upgrade, install and test two (02) Weapon Load Trainers/Mission Configuration trainers (WLT/MCT) and their associated technical documentation, located at NAS North Island, San Diego, CA and NAS Norfolk, VA. The effort is to baseline each trainer's configuration to the latest MH60S System Configuration (AOP 86.x), and to potentially upgrade the devices to subsequent AOPs. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTIFICATION to determine the availability and technical capability of potential offerors to provide the required deliverables.<br /><br />The contractor shall upgrade the two AMTs using the available data and documentation from the similar MH-60R design previously built and delivered, with the objective to maintain software and hardware commonality and life cycle supportability. The Contractor shall upgrade the functionality of the existing AMTs by developing, modifying, and integrating the applicable software modules and hardware design for the MH-60R AMT Device No PNAMT3 to an MH-60S aircraft configuration. This upgrade effort shall produce a training system that will provide realistic, full spectrum maintenance training that provides the operations, functions and equipment necessary to train avionics maintenance personnel to perform organizational level maintenance on the MH60S aircraft. <br /><br />The contractor shall upgrade two WLT/MCT's using available data and documentation to incorporate Organic Airborne Mine Counter Measures (OAMCM) aircraft mission configuration training capability to include the Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS), the Organic Airborne Surface and Influence Sweep (OASIS) and the Airborne Mine Laser Detection Set (ALMDS). Additionally, the WLT/MCT is equipped with the Carriage Stream Tow and Recovery System (CSTRS) that requires upgrading in accordance with Engineering Change Proposal ECP-I-20080002, ECP-I-2010000 and ECP H60-060. Potential exists to add MH-60S Fixed Forward Firing Weapon (MK197 Gun), new Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM), Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) and Hellfire R capabilities to the WLT/MCT. <br /><br />Potential sources should also be aware that there is a potential for a future upgrade from the MH-60S AOP 86.x baseline to an AOP&nbsp;100 series, and 110 series baseline, plus other additional Joint Weapon Program ECPs.<br />All training events and qualification exercises performed on the training system shall come as close as possible to yielding the same experience as the identical events performed on the aircraft including remove and install (R&amp;I) tasks. Specific trainer enhancements and detailed tasks are identified in the attached document.<br /><br /><strong>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</strong>: The majority of the effort can be completed at the contractor's facility, however future AOP updates will need to be done at the trainer locations. The contractor may be given the option to perform the entire effort at the AMT and WLT/MCT locations. <br /><br /><strong>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</strong>: The AMT and WLT/MCT currently fulfills the Navy training needs by providing a realistic, full spectrum maintenance trainer for electrical, avionics, and armament task areas. All training events and qualification exercises performed on the AMT and the WLT/MCT simulate the actual experience as the identical events performed on the aircraft. The AMT and the WLT/MCT provide training required for personnel unfamiliar with the MH-60S and refresher training for those preparing to deploy.<br /><br /><strong>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES</strong>: Interested parties should provide documentation on their <strong>Capabilities, Experience, and Schedule</strong> that demonstrates ability to fulfill the detailed trainer enhancements and tasks identified in the attached Technical Requirements document. <strong>CAPABILITIES</strong>: Interested parties should provide a brief company introduction and details on the company/organization, including any potential teaming approach and expected percentage of subcontracting required. Discuss your physical capacity for taking on this additional effort, taking into account current workload, and what plans you have if the physical capacity needs to be increased as a result of this proposed effort. Include information on program management, systems engineering, logistic management, requirements management, risks, facilities and personnel, software development plans and processes. Please include your understanding of NAVAIR System Engineering Technical Review (SETR), Testing and Evaluation (T&amp;E) and Information Assurance (IA) processes. Discuss your logistics efforts developing technical documentation, Initial Support System (ISI), Tools and Test Equipment (T&amp;TE), Engineering Data for Provisioning (EDFP), IUID 2-D Data Matrix tags, onsite maintenance and interim contract support. Additionally companies should discuss their understanding of the NAVAIR Risk Management Process and list any ground rules and/or assumptions that your company recommends for this effort i.e. type of contract, estimated period of performance, availability of GFE/GFI, etc. Though this is anticipated to be a Firm Fixed Priced Contract, companies should provide information on company implemented Earned Value Management Systems (EVMS), discussing program management reporting capabilities and feedback regarding availability of EVMS reporting on this contract effort. <strong>EXPERIENCE</strong>: Companies should provide details of their experience in the last 5 years doing similar work and any relevant experience on aircraft maintenance trainer simulation developments. Please provide the contract number, dollar value, period of performance and brief scope of work, <strong>SCHEDULE</strong>: The Government anticipates the AMT 2 and WLT/MCT 2 to be Ready For Training (RFT) between 18-24 months after contract award. The Government further anticipates that AMT 1 and WLT/MCT 1 will be RFT within 12 months of the AMT 2 and WLT/MCT 2 RFT date. The current trainers are used extensively and Government has only one AMT and one WLT on each coast, therefore the Government wants to limit downtime during the upgrade. Companies should describe how they intend to meet the Government's schedule, and provide options and solutions to meet the proposed schedule while limiting trainer downtime.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</strong>: The AMT trainers are not classified, therefore the contractor is not anticipated to have a security classification level to work on the devices; however Information Assurance (IA) requirements must be met. The Government currently has unlimited data rights for the MH-60R AMT baseline, and limited data rights on the MH-60S AMT. Under this effort, the Government will achieve the unlimited data rights under DFARS clause 252.227-7013, Rights in technical data - Noncommercial items, for all devices. <br /><br /><strong>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>

<DESC>This Amendment is to correct language in this announcement.<BR><BR>Overview:<BR><BR>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is the Center of Acquisition Excellence for Army training simulations.  <BR><BR>The PEO STRI Project Manager for Constructive Simulation (PM ConSim) is seeking commercially available products or prototypes that can be used to train Army commanders and staffs in attack the network operations  actions and activities designed to reduce Improvised Explosive Device (IED) effects and interrupt the enemys chain of IED activities by identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities and enabling offensive operations. (see attached for further information). <BR><BR>CIED/AtN will be separate system, under separate contract but will be a tool in the Low Overhead Simulation Stimulation Capability (LOSSC) toolkit.<BR> <BR>Challenge:<BR><BR>Army units require a training capability to prepare battalion and brigade level leaders and staff on attack the network skills. The strategy outlines a capability that integrates gaming and simulation tools, classroom instruction, and training with local governments.  The purpose is to train commanders and their staffs at brigade and lower to execute the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP) during Attack the Network Operations.  The AtN operation includes actions and activities designed to reduce IED effects and interrupt the enemys chain of IED activities by identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities and enabling offensive operations. The offense disrupts the enemys innovation cycle and buys time to create additional IEDcountermeasures. This effort is accomplished through intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, information operations, counter-bomber targeting, device technical and forensic exploitation, disposal of unexploded and captured ordnance, and persistent surveillance directed toward defeat of the enemys capabilities.<BR><BR>PEO STRI is searching for simulations, tools, games or components that could work with existing or emerging Army simulations and Battle Command systems as part of a toolkit  with or without modification or integration with other subsystems. Concept papers will not be considered. The simulation, tool, game or component should provide a simulated operational environment that supports the following, as well as the items in the attached requirements document.<BR><BR>"	Use of the Area, Structures, Capabilities, Organizations, People, and Events (ASCOPE) analytic construct to define operational variables<BR>"	Use of the Political, Military, Economic, Infrastructure, Information, Physical Environment, and Time (PMESII-PT) analytic construct to define operational variables<BR>"	Use of organic and non-organic enablers,<BR>"	Use of Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB), pattern analysis, and link analysis<BR>"	Use of biometrics, site exploitation, and forensics<BR>"	Positioning of C4ISR to stimulate battle command systems<BR><BR>Key features of the overall system will be that it <BR><BR>"	Operates on low-cost, common PC-type computers<BR>"	Operates at home station and deployed<BR>"	Requires minimal setup and support<BR>"	Supports single or multiple players<BR>"	Supports 2-D  and  3-D displays<BR>"	Provides real time after action review<BR>"	Can run real time and faster than real time, can warp time and can stop and replay time when key thresholds are met<BR>"	Stimulates the program of record and non-program of record Army command and control systems<BR>"	Uses geo-typical and geo-specific terrain data bases that are rapidly created and modified<BR>"	Provides robust 2D and 3D scenario editing capability and provides the ability to modify the scenario during scenario execution supporting observer/controller function such as the ability to emplace IEDs, OPFOR, civilians, vehicles, trash, and barriers<BR><BR>Responses:<BR><BR>When responding to the RFI, please provide the following information via email: <BR><BR>Organization Name<BR>Point of Contact (name, title, address, phone/fax, email)<BR>Product/Project Name<BR>Brief product/project description ( no more that 10 pages) that includes the following:<BR>	System design (a graphic is a plus) Technical requirements<BR>	Operational functions or missions supported<BR>How the system is currently being used and by whom (includes references)<BR>	Any supporting information<BR><BR>Respond to Sean Johnson at Sean.J.Johnson2@us.army.mil  by 1:00 p.m. EST on 14 October 2010.<BR><BR>For questions/concerns please contract the technical point of contact for this request is Becky Shell at (407) 384-3760 or the Contract Specialist, Sean Johnson at (407) 208-5042. <BR><BR>NOTE:  This is a request for information only and not a solicitation nor offer to do business of any kind with PEO STRI.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA) SEEKING 
EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST TO ACQUIRE A SITE FOR 
CONSTRUCTION OF A NATIONAL CEMETERY

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is interested in acquiring a site on which the Government may construct a VA national cemetery in the Brevard County, Florida, region.  VA will consider either a land purchase, or acceptance of a donated site.  VA is looking for a parcel of two hundred (200) contiguous and developable acres, or larger.

To be considered, the site must be within thirty-five (35) miles of the interchange of Interstate 95 and routes A1A and 528 near Merritt Island/Titusville, Florida.  In addition to proximity, the travel time via major highways will be a primary consideration.  VA has identified the following counties in the region as preferred locations:

Brevard, Orange and Osceola

Other requirements:  1) Site ownership must be free and clear title that does not contain any encumbrances unacceptable to the Government.  2) Full disclosure of any hazardous or toxic wastes or materials on the site must be communicated to the Government in writing.  3) Easy access to the property via major roadways must currently exist or be planned for the immediate future.  4) Appropriate utility service and road access must presently exist or must be presently approved or planned by the appropriate jurisdiction(s).

VA staff will conduct a market survey of offered properties.  Interested offerors (owners, brokers, or their legal representatives) should submit one (1) copy of the information concerning the property, by mail, fax or e-mail no later than 4:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time on October 27, 2010, to the following:

Jeffrey M. Leikin
Real Property Service (00CFM3C)
811 Vermont Avenue, NW, Rm. 419
Washington, DC  20005 
Telephone:  202-461-8246
Fax:  202-565-4974
E-mail:  jeffrey.leikin@va.gov

The Government will pay no more than the appraised fair market value for the site.

RESPONDENTS ARE ADVISED THAT VA ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY TO PURCHASE A SITE BASED UPON REPONSES TO THIS ADVERTISEMENT.

<DESC>This requirement is a proof of concept initiative. A unique collaborative partnership is needed for this requirement in order to provide a viable pilot program. The Monterey College of Law has been identified as the only source able to meet the requirements of this action.

The California Central Coast (CCC) Public Service Corps presents a different approach for creating a new generation of students dedicated to public service, building on the ROTC model. Rather than constructing a new bricks and mortar university campus, the Corps creates a concurrent Public Service Leadership pathway, similar to the Army, Navy and Air Force ROTC programs. The program does not duplicate basic undergraduate course work that can be completed at any accredited college or university.
 Rather, the Corps focuses on third- and fourth-year university curriculum and an intensive clinical program to provide returning veterans and college students with hands-on experience in a service learning environment as the pathway to becoming the next generation of public service leaders.

<DESC>the procurement of information technology (IT) support services for the Modeling Virtual Environments and Simulation (MOVES) Institute, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey California, by Other Than Full and Open Competition from Institute for the Future (IFTF), Palo Alto California. This procurement is required to support a collaborative research project starting in June 2010 which is supported by the Office of Naval Research (ONR).

This action will support ONR and NPS to help design, build and deploy the Massive Multiplayer Online Wargame Leveraging the Internet (MMOWGLI) project.  Online gaming and social networking tools will be combined with tactical modeling and simulation capabilities to produce a serious wargame available to personnel across the Naval enterprise.

Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), this authority is appropriate when procurement is  deemed to be available only from a single source.
  It is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B).) .

Other than IFTF, there is no other company that can provide these services at sufficiently high quality or on time.  These unique qualifications were determined during the prior conduct of a formal open industry-wide competition and submission of proposals to ONR.  Further the unique qualifications of IFTF have been repeatedly demonstrated by their successful conduct of multiple prior serious games, documented at http://www.iftf.org and elsewhere.  Once again competing such work would be a duplication of cost for the government.

<DESC>This procurement is required to support development of the World Model / Information Base Subsystem (WM/IB) for the Rapid Pro VIRT (RPV) product-line architecture of Persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (PISR) systems.  The RPV PISR architecture provides to the US Marine Corps a rapidly configurable and continuously adaptive means of pushing high-value information to the right Marine at the right time. RPV must filter and analyze massive amounts of data and then pass the results of the filtering through the WM/IB to the war fighter. A framework within RPV is needed to support the blackboard capability to retrieve, store and disseminate information to the warfighters via computers and radios that are fixed and mobile.
 Requirement will provide semantic hypotheses probabilistic management, allowing representation of fusion products in the form of derived hypotheses that supports smart push to the warfighter for critical mission support.

The contractor shall assist CHDS in its operations support of its programs.

VRC, Incorporated is the current contractor on the existing order and has performed exceptionally.  Service is quick and efficient, which saves the government time and money.  After two successful years together the government employees working with the contractor and together with the contractors employees have learned to work well together.
  A disruption to this process, the workflow, or increased employee turnover resulting from a change in contractor would reduce workplace morale and productivity ultimately resulting in increased costs and should be avoided if possible.

<DESC>I. Contracting Organization: <br />Department of the Air Force<br />Air Force Materiel Command<br />Aeronautical Systems Center<br />Medium Altitude UAS Division<br />2640 Loop Road West, Rm. 213<br />Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7106
<p>II. Description of Action: <br />This Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) is for acquisition of Civilian Manpower Equivalent (CME) services using other than full and open competition to support the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper programs for reasons of only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The period covered is 1 October 2010 through 15 January 2011.</p>
<p>Approval of this J&amp;A will result in a Firm Fixed Price contract modification, adding scope, to an existing contract with Riverside Research Institute. The estimated amount of this J&amp;A is $525,000.</p>
<p>III. Description of Services:<br />The MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper weapon systems are unmanned, multi-role systems capable of operating over the horizon while providing armed reconnaissance, attack and near real-time intelligence information to the Joint Task Force Commander as well as vital 24-hour surveillance and Close Air Support (CAS) coverage for ground forces supporting critical national security objectives.</p>
<p>The MQ-1 and MQ-9 are dynamically re-taskable weapon systems able to rapidly transition between reconnaissance, surveillance, target acquisition and attack missions. They adapt to all aspects of the "kill chain" (find, fix, track, target, engage and assess) for time-sensitive targeting. The MQ-1 Predator operates at medium altitudes and the MQ-9 Reaper at medium to high altitudes, integrating with joint air and space forces, as well as coalition and Allied Forces, to execute the Combatant Commander's priorities.</p>
<p>The services being procured under this J&amp;A include unique and sensitive requirements for CME which necessitate support from individuals with skills and operational experience. At this time, there is heavy reliance on contractor support with intimate knowledge. These tasks are required for both Medium Altitude UAS Division operations at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, Medium Altitude UAS Division - Detachment 3 (Det 3) in Poway, CA and Medium Altitude UAS Division - Det 3 Operating Locations (OL) at Gray Butte, CA and Creech AFB at Las Vegas, NV. To avoid unacceptable delays and potential disruption of services, Riverside Research Institute is uniquely qualified to provide the required services in that they have in place, trained personnel with the required skill sets and knowledge of existing programs. This allows them to provide the required level of service without additional ramp-up time, and facilitates with no disruption to services while the final phase of the long term strategy is implemented.</p>
<p>IV. Authority:<br />Regulation 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>V. Applicability of Authority:<br />Specific tasking to the Medium Altitude UAS Division comes from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition (SAF/AQ), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), the UAS General Officer Steering Group and other government entities such as the Department of Homeland Security and US Joint Forces Command. These vitally important and highly sensitive tasks directly support ground forces and air operations for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF) and Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF). Many of the unique MQ-1 and MQ-9 capabilities, now so valuable to the warfighter, have and are continuing to evolve against a rapidly changing threat and countermeasures environment. This environment requires rapid innovations, the ability to change and the ability to react to unexpected interdependencies. Due to the pace of program execution and requisite knowledge of the programs and ACAT I requirements, all CME positions are considered highly specialized for purposes of supporting the needs of the program. This J&amp;A will provide short-term, transition support until the CME positions can be filled via competitive vehicles.</p>
<p>The impact of not having this short-term support would be an 80 day break in service of CME support. This break would do irreparable harm to the ongoing efforts within the program due to breaks in service and loss of continuity and program corporate knowledge. Any potential loss will result in delays and disruptions due to lost time and duplicative training. <br />In summary, the system complexities, interrelationships and high degree of technical integration of the MQ-1 and MQ-9 programs create a need to continue with a follow on effort with the current highly specialized expertise and to transition the efforts to a competed contract vehicle in early January 2011. Accordingly, Riverside Research Institute is the only firm capable of providing the services described in Section III above without the Air Force experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.</p>
<p>VI. Efforts to Obtain Competition:<br />All CME services within the Medium Altitude UAS Division operations at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, Medium Altitude UAS Division - Detachment 3 (Det 3) in Poway, CA and Medium Altitude UAS Division - Det 3 Operating Locations (OL) at Gray Butte, CA and Creech AFB at Las Vegas, NV are transitioning to a competitive contract vehicle by early January 2011.</p>
<p>VII. Fair and Reasonable Costs:<br />The contracting officer will ensure that the cost of this acquisition is fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 15.4. The Medium Altitude UAS Division currently has resources available to accomplish detailed engineering/technical analysis, quality assurance and cost/price analysis. The Medium Altitude UAS Division and Medium Altitude UAS Division - DET 3 technical personnel will perform detailed technical and/or task evaluations to determine the appropriate level of effort for this requirement. Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) offices may be requested to provide analysis of proposed rates and provide field reports when determined necessary by the contracting officer. The rates used to award the original effort were audited by DCAA in 2009 and will be used to evaluate the reasonableness of the rates and price for the period of performance extension and additional work.</p>
<p>VIII. Market Research:<br />The current transition plan will maximize use of available competitive vehicles for acquiring support services. The main research will be focused on determining the best fit vehicle by which to procure the required services. Initial market research indicates that there are several competitive vehicles within DoD that may be able to provide the required services. The market research has identified the tasks that best align to the available competitively awarded contracts.</p>
<p>IX. Other Facts:<br />The Predator was initially developed as an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration. The US Navy contracted for this particular Predator system and did not buy data rights. When the system transferred to the Air Force, it was directed to be managed under Big Safari's specialized management processes and logistics and engineering data for the system were not pursued or procured. Therefore, heavy reliance on contractor support with intimate system knowledge is essential. At this time, only Riverside Research Institute is known to have the necessary highly specialized and skilled personnel to meet the required tasks in time to support the mission without disruption and/or substantial duplicative training effort.</p>
<p>X. Interested Sources:<br />This requirement has not been made available to other contractors prior to the efforts being undertaken to transition to a competitive award and therefore there are not currently any known interested sources.</p>
<p><br />XI. Steps to Foster Competition:<br />This requirement will be transitioned to a competitive contract in January 2011.</p>
<p>XII. Contracting Officer's (CO) Certification:<br />The CO's signature on the J&amp;A evidences she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of her knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>XIII. Technical Requirements Personnel's Certification:<br />As evidenced by their signatures on the J&amp;A signature page, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete.</p>

Authority Cited - Title 10 United States Code U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 - "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br/><br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited - The proposed acquisition requires the use of the cited statutory authority based on the following:<br/><br/>    a.  Depot Maintenance Work Requirement (DMWR) 1-2995-250 dated 22 January 2001, with Change 2; dated 31 December 2006 is insufficient to support competitive contracts for the induction of  P/N's  5078T29G01, 5078T29G02, P/N 5078T29G04 for the overhaul and modification to P/N 5078T29G10.  The referenced DMWR is also insufficient to support competitive contracts for the induction of upgrade P/N 5078T29G05 to P/N 5078T29G06.  Paragraphs 2.6-2 and 2.6-4 of the cited DMWR require the DECUs be returned to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for modification.  This item has not been identified as a Critical Safety Item (CSI).  BAE Systems Controls (2000 Taylor Street, Fort Wayne, IN 46802-4605, CAGE 63760) is the OEM and is the only known commercial source of overhaul for this item. The DECU is critical to the safe operation of the aircraft and, as such, requires extremely close overhaul tolerances and quality assurance provisions.  The Government's required production schedule is at the rate of 15 each per month, 120 days after receipt of reparables.<br/><br/>   b.  Any competing contractor could not be familiar with the total design parameters, specific repair part requirements, obsolescence issues, test processes, etc., and therefore can reasonably be expected to require a considerable length of time to commence or complete an overhaul/modification program, with no guarantee of success due to factors identified herein.  These shortfalls would prevent a competitive contractor from having online/available capability to satisfy specific program requirements (quality aspects, tooling/test equipment, and engineering support) to meet the applicable delivery schedules and/or overhaul turnaround time frames.<br/><br/>   c.  Failure to award the requirement to the OEM will result in serious injury to the U.S. Government's ability to provide quick reaction response teams in support of the Blackhawk fleets in operation enduring freedom and operation Iraqi freedom.     <br/>    <br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition - This action will be synopsized on or about 19 March 2010 through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) as required by FAR 5.201, prior to issuance of the solicitation of the requirement.  The only known source is shown in paragraph 5.  Additional sources identified through the synopsis procedure will receive due consideration as prescribed by law.  This item was published in the Competition Advocate's Shopping List (CASL) dated September 2009.  PRIDs 08CT251 and 08DT251 have the same form, fit and function, and therefore are combined for a single award.  As stated in paragraph 5, BAE Control Systems is the OEM for both configurations.  <br/><br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition - The cited DMWR is insufficient to support competitive contracts for the induction of P/N's 5078T29G01, 5078T29G02, P/N 5078T29G04 for the overhaul/ modification and upgrade to P/N 5078T29G10 and the induction of  P/N 5078T29G05 for the overhaul/modification and upgrade to P/N 5078T29G06.   The only approved source for this item is stated in paragraph 5.<br/><br/>8.  Market Research - Market Research was conducted within the last 12 months in accordance with FAR 10.002, including personal knowledge of technical representatives, contacting knowledgeable persons in Government and industry, and review of Government and/or commercial databases for relevant information.  This requirement can be met by commercial items; therefore, FAR Part 12 will be utilized for this acquisition.  BAE Controls Systems, (2000 Taylor Street, Fort Wayne, IN 46802-4605, CAGE 63760), is the OEM and is the only known commercial source of overhaul for this item.  This item was last published in the AMCOM CASL in September 2009.  <br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources - In accordance with FAR 5.201, this requirement will be published in FedBizOpps on or about 19 March 2010 and any proposals received shall be considered.  All interested sources identified through the market research and FedBizOpps will receive due consideration as prescribed by law.  To date, no other sources have written to express interest in this requirement.  <br/><br/>10.  Other Factors -<br/><br/> a.   There is a reasonable basis to conclude that only BAE Systems Controls can satisfy the needs of the Government at this time.  <br/><br/> b.   Follow-on acquisition is not anticipated to be fully competitive due to reasons stated in     paragraph 5 above.  <br/><br/>        c. Procurement History:  <br/>      <br/>Contract W58RGZ-05-D-0121 was awarded to BAE Systems Controls using the authority of FAR 6.302-1-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  <br/><br/> Contract No. /D.O.                   Award Date                Qty              U/P      Total Cost<br/> W58RGZ-05-D-0121/0007      09 December 2008    30 Each    $4,221     $126,645  <br/> W58RGZ-05-D-0121/0004      12 March 2007       46 Each    $4,462     $962,698<br/> W58RGZ-05-D-0121/0003      01 November 2006    72 Each    $4,459     $321,081<br/> W58RGZ-05-D-0121/0002      21 March 2006       71 Each    $4,847     $344,193<br/><br/>d.   Acquisition Data Availability -Technical data is available; however, it is insufficient to support a full and open competitive solicitation.  Items must be returned to the OEM for overhaul/modification. This DECU is not classified as a CSI.  In accordance with DMWR 1-2995-250, Chapter 2-6.4 (page 2-3), part numbers 5078T29G01, 5078T29G02 and 5078T29G04 must be modified to 5078T29G10. Part numbers 5078T29G05 and 5078T29G06 must be modified to 5078T29G06. These modifications are to be performed by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  The tooling, fixtures, and test equipment in DMWR 1-2995-250 have been identified as critical.  The drawings, test stand and software required for this overhaul/modification are proprietary to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and are not available or obtainable for this requirement. Title 10 United States Code U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 - "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br/><br/>e.   Subcontracting Competition- Per FAR 19.702 and FAR 19.704, a subcontracting plan is required for large businesses on negotiated acquisitions that exceed $550,000.  According to FAR 19.704 the contractor must include FAR 52.219-8, entitled Utilization of Small Business Concerns in all subcontracts that offer further subcontracting opportunities (except small businesses) to adopt a plan that complies with requirements of the clause at FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, which covers Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Women-Owned Small Business, Hub-Zone Small Business and Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns.  A Subcontracting Plan will be required from BAE Systems.  The contractor must also include FAR 52.244-5, entitled Competition in Subcontracting.  BAE  Systems (Cage 63760) will be required to comply with these requirements.<br/><br/>1.  The Contractor shall select subcontractors (including suppliers) on a competitive basis to the maximum practical extent consistent with the objectives and requirements of the contract.<br/><br/>2.  If the Contractor is an approved mentor under the Department of Defense Pilot Mentor-Prot g  Program (Pub. L. 101-510, section 831 as amended), the Contractor may award subcontracts under this contract on a noncompetitive basis to its prot g s.<br/><br/>

 VISN 22 NETWORK CONTRACTING ACTIVITY
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 8.402(f), 8.405-6(b)(1)

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: The VISN 22 Network Contracting Activity, 5901 E. 7th Street, Long Beach, California, as directed by the VA Long Beach Healthcare System (VALBHS) will establish a Delivery Order that requires justification for other than full and open competition. In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(b)(1), FAR 8.402(f), and FAR 6.302-1 we seek to use limited sources on GSA and sole source open market items to create a Delivery Order. 

2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  The awarded contractor is to provide VISN 22, with Streem Center System / Xerox DocShare equipment, software, installation, training, and technical support.  The proposed procurement shall be a Delivery Order through the FSS vendor.  The estimated cost for FSS is , for items listed under the FSS schedule and open market.  The estimated cost is $150,282.59.  

3. Description of Requirement: VA Long Beach Healthcare System is requesting sole source procurement from Xerox / Cleo Streem Communications.  The seventy-five percent of the procurement can be purchased through the mandatory FSS schedule and the other twenty-five percent shall require an open market purchase.  The estimated cost for equipment, software, installation, training technical support, and travel expenses is $150,282.59. FSS: $96006.34, and Open Market: $54276.25.

4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  This request is pursuant to the authority of FAR Part 8.405-6(b)1, FAR Part 8.402(f), and FAR Part 6.302-1(a).

5.  The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: 
a.	In accordance to FAR Part 8.405-6(b) 1, the use of limited sources procedures for FSS schedules may be used when only once source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the requirement .  Cleo\Streem Communications is a GSA small business that is affiliated with Xerox under a 'Contractor Team Agreement' (attached) to provide an integrated solution for Prosthetics.  No other vendor known can provide this solution as a GSA contract procurement.    Cleo/Streem does not have a business partner relationship with any other office equipment manufacturer.  In addition,  the Cleo/Streem solution is becoming the VA standard for Prosthetics, having been implemented at VISNs 7,8,9 and 11, and with VISN 19 among others also considering.  The DocShare server is the place of storage for documents filed by the Cleo\Streem.  As it happens, this is also a Xerox product, one that has been used in the VISN for a number of years.   The use of this system for storage in the integrated solution has several benefits, including unifying servicing under one vendor that understands both the server and the Cleo/Streem applications.  In addition, the VA is spared the cost of provisioning another storage system with the cost of the hardware, software; and the documents from the Cleo/Streem system stored on the Docushare server can be integrated into the existing backup strategy for Docushare.  The efficiency and cost savings are calculated by comparing the current manual process utilized in Prosthetics with the automation provided by the solution.    For example the average time to print and fax an order is reduced from about 3 minutes manually to about 1 minute from the desktop.  The time to file an order is reduced from an average of 5 minutes to well under a minute.  The time for pulling files for follow up calls is reduced to under a minute.  Prosthetics processes an average of 9,400 orders a month and the potential savings in staff time alone (at avg $18.50/hr salary and benefits), is close to $40,000 month and improvement for customer service via faster response, reduced errors, etc, and also other intangible benefits.  
b.	Under 8.402(f), an ordering activity for convenience, may add items not on the Federal Supply Schedule to a BPA based off of an FSS contract under certain conditions.  1) The add-on must comply with all publicizing and competition requirements of the FAR, including FAR part 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, and 15.  In the interest of convenience these items should be added to this BPA pursuant to 8.402(f) and for the reasons stated below.
c.	FAR Part 6.302-1(a) allows for the procurement of items through other than full and open competition; applicable when the agency's minimum needs may only be satisfied by a supply or service that is unique and available from only one responsible source.   Due to the nature of this acquisition, Xerox is the only contractor that can provide the above aforementioned items.  For the VA to use any other item in conjunction with this FSS purchase, numerous operability issues shall arise and would also conflict with current standardization policies.  For successful implementation and to avoid voiding warranties, it is necessary that we go with these Xerox items that are only available from this contractor.  Thus these open market items shall be procured under other than full and open competition.
 
6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.  See number 5 above.  

7. Anticipated Cost: The anticipated cost is fair and reasonable based on their GSA contract and historical contract data.

8. Results of Market Survey: No market research was conducted. See Items 5 above. 

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.  See Items 5 above.

10. Any Other Interested Sources?  None.

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: Any subsequent solicitation will be issued on a competitive basis because it is anticipated that enough time will be allowed for the Government to accommodate the entire procurement process.

12. I hereby certify that the above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

VA Midwest Healthcare System
	Minneapolis Purchasing & Contracting
	708 S Third St., Ste 200E
	Minneapolis, MN  55415

(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. 
Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for providing 6 additional Brit Vision Diagnostic Workstations for the BRIT Systems Picture Archival Communications System (PACS) located at the VAMC Minneapolis. 

(3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).  
These Diagnostic Workstations will be utilized by the Radiology department. The workstations are utilized by the Radiologist to interpret imaging exams that are used to diagnose patient conditions.  Estimated value is $334,705.00.

(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. 
FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. 
The VA Medical Center currently owns BRIT Systems Picture Archival Communications System (PACS). The Brit Vision Diagnostic Workstation is the only Workstation that fully integrates with our PACS system.  This is an acquisition for additional equipment to integrate with an already installed system, and the PACS system is comprised of proprietary components that are not available from any other source.

(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. 
Advertisement will be made in FBO as a Combined Synopsis with intent to enter into a sole source with BRIT Systems, Inc.  However, opportunity will be provided to the general public to respond to the requirement.

(7) A determination that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.
Pricing will be compared to previous contracted acquisitions with the Minneapolis VA Medical Center.    Further price reasonableness will be determined by comparison of other Government agency acquisitions using the FPDS ezSearch tool.

(8) A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. 
Market research consisted of a VetBiz, and SBA Dynamic Small Business Search under NAICS code 334112, and keyword "Diagnostic Viewer".

(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: 
BRIT system software is proprietary  

 (10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.
None

(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. 
In order to enhance competition, the entire PACS would have to be replaced, which is cost prohibitive in relation to the estimated maintenance costs.       

(12) Contracting officer certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

<DESC>Description of Work, The modification would include firm fixed price for 24-hour facilities operations, maintenance, and emergency repair/response services for all US Southern Command and US Army Garrison Miami real property facilities, components and systems, and selected improved grounds maintenance ( roads, parking, storm water retention, utilities, security fencing and related equipment ). It may include a limited cost plus capacity to estimate scope/cost, design, and perform minor maintenance and repair projects not covered by new construction warranties and/or minor alteration projects to meet new operational requirements. It will not include landscape maintenance, custodial services, or utilities services. The facilities complex supported by this modification is a new $400-million campus style complex, expected to be complete on 30 September 2010, that includes three complex, state-of-the-art multi-purpose and command and control facilities totaling over 630,000 square feet, all supporting roads, parking, drainage, storm water retention, utilities, back-up power and other supporting infrastructure. The complex is located on a government secured 55-acre site in Miami-Doral, FL and will support over 2,800 government employees and contractors that make up Headquarters, US Southern Command (one of six regional US Combatant Commands critical to national security) responsible for command and control of US military operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as US Army Garrison Miami, and a diverse array of other supporting tenants and activities. The site will be secured and require appropriate government background checks and identification for access; with some areas requiring a Secret security clearance and/or escorted access. The national significance of this site and of the functions it supports requires a unique and significantly high degree of response, urgency, and expertise.<br/>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1.	Identification of (1) the agency (2) the contracting activity.

The laboratory of the Director of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism Division in (1) the Research Department of the VA Healthcare System, Jamaica Plain campus.

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.

The purchase of electrochemiluminescent, multi-analyte, analytical laboratory equipment from
Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) as a sole source, to include a service package to provide a warranty on the item, covering all maintenance by MSD.

3.	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).

1)	SECTOR Imager 2400A - 
The system requested is the SECTOR Imager 2400 (Imager), a laboratory analytical instrument designed and manufactured by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) for measurement of protein biomarkers, such as phosphoproteins, cytokines and other signaling molecules. The Imager utilizes MSD's MULTI-ARRAY technology, bringing together electrochemiluminescence detection and patterned array microwell plates.

4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.
6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source.
5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualification or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.

Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) utilizes electrochemiluminescence (ECL) to detect binding events on patterned arrays. The combination forms a unique solution offering sensitivity, dynamic range and the ability to measure multiple analytes in one sample (multiplexing capability). However, this technology does not employ fluidics nor loose coated beads which have been found to decrease the sensitivity and reproducibility. Instead, this technology uses coated wells which are more stable and reliable. 

The SECTOR Imager 2400 laboratory analytical instruments are compatible only with MSD immunoassay kits and vice versa. There are no other technologies that enable multiplexed measurement using electrochemiluminescence for detection. Further, there are no other suppliers that provide a non-fluidics system that utilizes electrochemiluminescence detection. Finally, MSD is the only supplier that sells the SECTOR Imager instruments and compatible micro-well plates and immunoassay kits.

6.	Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a FedBizOps notice was or will be published as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.

Information on this equipment was received directly from MSD through their website (www.mesoscale.com) as well as contact with a sales representative. Other companies were contacted to see whether they offered equipment with electrochemiluminescence detection methods and capability of taking measurements from micro-well based assays. Research confirming that other businesses did not offer the similar equipment was conducted by visiting their websites as well as by contacting sales and technical representatives. When appropriate, meetings in person were held with demonstrations.

7.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.

Although this technology is offered by only one source the equipment has been offered at a substantial discount off the original cost. Given the highly specialized nature and the limited availability of this equipment it is not typical to receive this type of discount. 

8.	A description of the market research conducted (i.e., names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.

MSD: sales representative: Received information on the detection method of electrochemiluminescence of this instrument as well as the molecules that can be assayed. Received information on the makeup of the assay including the use of micro-well plates specific to this technology. Conducted tests of equipment and assays in person to monitor reproducibility and reliability. 
The following is the results of those tests:
Reproducibility was better than acceptable, producing coefficient of variations less than 10% for samples run in duplicates. Multiple analytes were tested at once with results being reported in the acceptable standard ranges and above all sensitivities. Results were in linear part of standard curves confirming the reliability of reported values. Total run time was between 4 and 6 hours. Results correlated with golden standard technology used for single measurements of analytes.

Other technologies were also researched, and other companies were assessed. Neither offered electrochemiluminescence detection or use of micro-well plates for multiple analyte measurement, as needed by this lab. 

9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specification, engineering description, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.

No facts beyond the technology, including electrochemiluminescence and micro-well plates to read multiple analytes, available only from one company (MSD).

10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.

Director of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism Division of the VA Healthcare System (West Roxbury, Jamaica Plain/Boston, and Brockton campuses).

11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.

Contracting Activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible.
