<DESC>Description
Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB) Broad Agency Announcement FY05

A.    THIS IS A BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA AWB 05-0001) FOR AIR WARFARE BATTLELAB OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005
 (1 October 2004 through 30 September 2005).

B.    INTRODUCTION 

The Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB) invites concept papers with preliminary cost estimates on innovative Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) and Combat Air Forces (CAF) concepts.  This BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984".  Concept papers in response to this announcement shall be submitted to 366 CONS/LGCB, marked for BAA AWB-04-0001, 366 Gunfighter Ave, Bldg 512 Suite 498, Attn: Mrs. Becky Briggs, Mountain Home AFB ID 83648.  Electronic submission of concept papers may be made to becky.briggs@mountainhome.af.mil by attaching the document to e-mail.  Responses should reference the above BAA number and provide telephone and email contact information.  This announcement is open and effective until 30 SEP 05.  Concept papers in response to this announcement may be submitted at any time during this period.  There will be no other solicitation issued for this topic and offerors should be on the alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.  Additionally, this BAA and all amendments and information related to this announcement will be posted electronically on the INTERNET at: http://www.mountainhome.af.mil/AWB and to the Federal Business Opportunities at http://www.eps.gov

C.    OBJECTIVE

(1) Technical Description: 
 
The mission of the Air Warfare Battlelab is to rapidly identify and prove the worth of innovative ideas for enhancing the deployability, sustainability, survivability, and lethality of contingency Air Expeditionary Forces for Global Engagement.  
 
It is focused in two areas: combat air forces and agile combat support.  
 
This BAA requests concept papers to identify material and non-materiel solutions to make forces lighter, leaner and more lethal.  
 
Concepts should directly benefit deployed expeditionary forces, although the entire cradle-to-grave continuum of warfare should be considered.  
 
The proposed concept will be based on the demonstration of a MATURE, COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY.
 
All responses to this BAA will be evaluated for applicability to the aforementioned need.    
 
Should an offeror submit a concept that is better aligned with the needs of another Battlelab or requiring activity, the Air Warfare Battlelab will send written notice of this fact with reference to the appropriate activity. 

D.    ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Potential offerors are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number and reference number BAA AWB 05-0001 with their submissions. Potential offerors are required to register their company information at www.ccr.gov before any contracts can be awarded to that company.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to apply.  Notice to Foreign Owned Firms: Such firms are asked to immediately notify the Air Force point of contact, Mrs. Becky Briggs at (208) 828-3108 or email to: becky.briggs@mountainhome.af.mil upon deciding to respond to this announcement.  Foreign contractors shall be aware that restrictions may apply which could preclude their participation in this program.

E.    CONCEPT PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS 

The cost of preparing concept papers in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost IAW FAR 31.205-18.  Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the concept paper and any evaluations.  The submitter must mark the concept paper with a protective legend IAW FAR 3.104-5.  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or proposals are not desired.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to submit concept papers, not to exceed five (5) pages, to the electronic addresses listed in section A of this announcement.  However, if you do not have the capability of transmitting the concept paper electronically, submit three (3) copies, not to exceed 5 pages, of the proposed concept to Mrs. Briggs at the address in Section A of this BAA.  The concept paper shall be formatted as follows: 

Section A: Title, Submitter, Date, E-Mail Account, Phone#, Fax #, Organization/Office Symbol, Address; Period of Performance, Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost of effort. 

Section B: Problem Statement, Need Statement or Operational Impact statement which concisely summarizes how the product of the demonstration will enhance Air Force AEF and/or CAF operations.

Section C: Proposed Solution summarizing innovative concept and use of commercial or non-developmental items (NDI) to accomplish the demonstration.

Section D: Proposed Concept Demonstration concisely describing the demonstration and execution methodology. 

Section E: Support Components required for the demonstration to include hardware, software, data, facilities and training.

Section F: Expected Results, Benefits or Product of the demonstration. 

Section G: Proposed AF and DoD operational users of the concept; and 

Section H: Identify similar contracts to include the point of contact’s current telephone # and address.  For papers marked proprietary, the offeror shall submit a non-proprietary title and summary, not to exceed one (1) additional page.

Multiple concept papers addressing different research areas may be submitted by each offeror; however, each concept paper should address only one concept.  Those concept papers found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a complete technical and price proposal.  AN INVITATION BASED UPON A SUBMITTED CONCEPT PAPER DOES NOT ASSURE THAT THE OFFEROR WILL BE AWARDED A SUBSEQUENT CONTRACT. 

F.    BASIS FOR AWARD

(1) Concept papers will be evaluated as they are received based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other concepts submitted under this announcement.  Concept papers will be evaluated under the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: 

(a) The extent to which the proposed concept makes the Air Force lighter, leaner or more lethal, 

(b) Impact of the proposed concept on one or more of the six Air Force Distinctive Capabilities (Air and Space Superiority, Global Attack, Rapid Global Mobility, Precision Engagement, Information Superiority, Agile Combat Support), 

(c) Technical merit of the proposed concept with an emphasis on novel, creative, and innovative solutions, and 

(d) Proposed cost.  

All four areas, (a) through (d), will be evaluated at the same time during the evaluation process.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the concept papers.

(2) Anticipated Period of Performance: Average duration of demonstrations will be up to 15 months from time of award through complete evaluation and demonstration of the operational concept.  However, some initiatives may require more resources depending on complexity of the concept.  Type of contract(s) expected: Firm-Fixed Price (Unless another contract type is determined by the contracting officer to be more appropriate).  Primary appropriation type: Operations and Maintenance

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 05-05 DARPA neXt Generation (XG) Communications Phase III; CLOSING DATE:  26 OCT 05; FULL PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS:  12:00 Local Time, Arlington, VA;  13 December 2004.  POC:  Preston Marshall, DARPA/ATO; Email: BAA05-05@darpa.mil;  Web:  http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/xg/index.htm

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the development and demonstration of prototype spectrum agile radios.  These radios are to dynamically adapt to changing spectrum environments within the limits of usage policies with an objective to access 10 times more spectrum without causing harmful interference to non-cooperative radios.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal in accordance with the instruction provided in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) at any time up to the proposal due date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 05-05) on or before 12:00 Local Time, Arlington, VA on 13 December 2004.  

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle awarded will be determined by the government. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are, in order of importance: (a) XG Prototype; (b) XG Prototype Demonstration Program; (c) Management Approach; and (d) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission; and (e) Cost Realism.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.

The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA, and awards may be made without discussions.  DARPA may choose to select for negotiation all of a given proposal, or selected portions thereof.

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must read the associated PIP available at www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov, which provides specific information about this BAA, including instructions on how to respond.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent by the FHWA to make a sole source award of a cost-reimbursement contract to The Intermodal Association of North America(IANA). This notice is NOT a Request For Competitive Proposals. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has a need to continue support of the Intermodal Freight Technology Working Group (IFTWG), which began in 1999. The IFTWG is critical to the deployment of best practices identified in the ITS freight operational tests conducted between 1999-2003. The contractor would support IFTWG to continue to meet its goals and objectives through the development and conduct of workshops and other outreach and educational events. Support and assistance would also be provided for the participation of private sector stakeholders in technology demonstration projects, supporting IFTWG in its role as a forum for individuals, corporations, and other intermodal freight related industry associations. Support would also be provided in assisting in the deployment of intermodal freight deployment tests with other countries. Interested firms or organizations should identify their capability to respond to the work requirements stated above. Expression of interest without sufficient detail to permit an evaluation of capabilities and oral expressions of interest will not be considered. Based upon the responses received to this notice, a determination by the Government to compete or not to compete will be made. Any information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive acquisition for this effort. In the absence of receiving responses from interested parties that demonstrate their capability to perform this effort, the FHWA intends to proceed with the finalization of award to IANA. Responses must be received no later than November 4, 2004.

<DESC>In response to a Presidential Management Agenda, FTA must devise an accounting methodology to allocate resource use by program objectives and must link resource use to actual program results.  FTA strategic plans link management goals with program goals and objectives, but the full cost to accomplish the desired program result is not readily available to management because FTA does not allocate internal resources such as salaries, and equipment, and program resources such as formula and discretionary grants to specific activities or program delivery efforts.  Cost accounting is intended to enhance this linkage by identifying the cost of Federal resources used by a program in relation to specific goals and objectives and by supporting the process of resource allocation to program allocation, by objective, in the budget process.  The implementation of a managerial cost accounting system will enhance the ability of FTA management to analyze program costs in relation to how well they allow us to achieve our program objectives, thereby enabling management to improve the performance of program cost effectiveness.  

Therefore, this requirement seeks contractor support to identify and implement a cost accounting methodology that will satisfy mandatory managerial and legal requirements and will improve FTA’s cost assignment efforts. This is an 8(a) Competitive Set Aside award.  The Government intends to award an IDIQ/Time and Materials delivery order with one base and four options.  The expected date of award is December 10, 2004.
Proposals are due via Email to Emmanuel McKever (emmanuel.mckever@fta.dot.gov) on or before November 16, 2004.

<DESC>This is a requirement for a WEIGHT HANDLING EQUIPMENT MULTIPLE AWARD CONTRACT (WHE MAC) – SOLICITATION NUMBER N3258A-04-R-1900.  THIS SOLICITATION IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.    The WHE MAC will be used primarily for the ordering of new Overhead Electric Traveling (OET) cranes of varying spans and lifting capacities for Navy, Marine Corp, or other federal activities worldwide.  Hoists will be either manufacturers’ standard commercial or custom designed.  In either case however, many of the assemblies and subassemblies will be standard off-the-shelf components.   Bridge girders will typically be custom designed to fit the runway span.  The work contemplated under this procurement will include, but not be limited to, the following:  Site survey/investigation, design, fabrication, rail survey/installation, demolition/removal of existing cranes and equipment, associated runway/equipment electrification, crane installation, crane testing, operational training requirements, etc. While it is anticipated that the WHE MAC will be used primarily for the purchase of new OET cranes, other equipment/services that may be ordered include: 1) Jib Cranes, Monorails, Trolley Hoists, Wall Cranes or similar weight handling equipment; and 2) Reconstitution/overhaul of the various types of weight handling equipment covered by this WHE MAC. Application for use of the weight handling equipment procured under this contract may range from general purpose to more complex applications.  Individual project design requirements will reflect such applications. The Government reserves the right to award up to five Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts under this solicitation or to award only one contract covering only the seed project identified in the solicitation.  Award of the up to five ID/IQ contracts comprising the WHE MAC will be made to the responsible offerors, whose proposals, conforming to the solicitation, are considered to be the most advantageous to the government as a result of a best value evaluation. Technical evaluation factors, when combined, will be considered approximately equal in to price in the best value evaluation.  Award of the initial project (delivery order) covering the design, fabrication, installation and testing of two 10-Ton OET cranes and one 20-Ton OET crane for installation in the Undersea Network Centric Laboratory, Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC), Newport, RI will be made to the offeror whose proposal is considered to be the most advantageous overall as a result of the best value evaluation described above.  Proposal Evaluation factors may include: 1) Price for the initial project; 2) Relevant Past Performance; 3) Management Approach; 3) Technical Experience, Expertise, and Qualifications; 4) Quality Control.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 333923 and the corresponding small business size standard is 500 employees. The total amount of the WHE MAC contract (i.e., the total amount of all delivery orders issued during the contract term, regardless of the number of contracts awarded) shall not exceed $30,000,000.  The WHE MAC contract will be valid for ordering future requirements for up to 5 YRS (i.e., base ordering period of one year, with options for four additional one-year ordering periods) from the date of award, or when the total value of the WHE MAC as described above reaches $30,000,000, whichever occurs first. Future delivery/task orders will be competed only among the up to five successful contractors. Award of each future delivery/task order may be based on either Best Value to the Government or low price. The ID/IQ contract awards resulting from the solicitation will include a minimum guarantee of $10,000.  Award of a delivery order under the ID/IQ contract(s) will satisfy the minimum guarantee.   Delivery/Task orders may require the work of registered professional engineers.     Per the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) has been amended to require that all contractors be registered in the Department of Defense (DoD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Information concerning registration in CCR may be obtained by visiting the website www.ccrdlsc.dla.mil or by referring to DFAR Subpart 204.73.  Offerors should submit verification of their firm’s registration in the CCR database with their proposal.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for a Ground & Airborne Avionics System for the sub-scale GTM Research Aircraft. The development of the GTM Aircraft for sub-scale aircraft research involves relatively large amounts of resources and manpower. The potential for crashes of the model aircraft or equipment failure exist, and  a crash would result in damage to the equipment.  To assure success of the project and to minimize major disruptions to achieving the research capibility under development, the procurement of backup equipment, identical to that of the original system, is desired.  Other avionics systems that could provide the same functionality would introduce an additional engineering effort and a resulting large time delay to develop the functionality provided by the original system.  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Microbotics, Inc., Hampton, Virginia. Microbotics is the only known source capable of satisfying the Government's requirements (see Attachment 1). Sole source authority for this requirement is FAR 13.106-1(b).  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 5, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),  proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Dow Key Microwave Corporation of Ventura, California for thirty (30) high power RF switches.  These switches are being purchased for compatibility and interchangeability with the radar wind profiler (RWP) system for use at the U.S. Air Force’s Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS) sites.  The required specifications for the high power switch(s) include 350 watt average power handling capability, greater than 15 dB isolation, maximum of 0.1 dB insertion loss, 7/16 DIN type long neck female connector and a vacuum relay activated, rated for 5 million switching cycles.  Dow Key Microwave has specifically designed these switches to handle a higher power than our system transmits, to be reliable with high isolation, low insertion loss, and to posses a long mean-time between failures.  These switches have gone through extensive field testing and meet the requirement for maintainability, data quality, repeatability, and system and data interfaces.  Past history with other switches has shown problems with power handling capability and mean-time between failures.  The new RWP must be identical to the production prototype, therefore, the switches must be provided by Dow Key Microwave.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100K).  This notice is for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Terms and Conditions can be found on http://www.arnet.gov/far and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/CONOPS/reflib/alp1296.htm.  Anticipated award date will be November 11, 2004.

<CONTACT>Cynthia Harley, Contract Specialist, Phone 360-396-0262, Fax 360-396-0853, Email cindy.harley@navy.mil
<DESC>Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Engineering Field Activity, Northwest (EFA NW) intends to increase the capacity under contract N44255-01-D-1035, Indefinite Quantity Architect-Engineering Contract for Marine Waterfront Projects at Various Locations Serviced by EFANW by $500,000 on a sole source basis.  Contract N44255-01-D-1035 was awarded on 29 May 2002 to Berger Abam Engineers, Inc. and included a base year and two option years.  The maximum contract value for the base year and two option years was $5,000,000 combined.  The first option year expired on 28 May 2004 and the second option year was awarded.  The second option expires on 
28 May 2005.  The remaining capacity is not adequate to accommodate post construction award services for three pier projects currently in the middle construction.  The Government has determined that awarding these services to a contractor other than the designer of record, Berger Abam, would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and would considerably increase the time of performance on these mission critical projects.  This is NOT a request for proposal.  However, if another firm believes it can perform these services with greater dollar and time savings than anticipated by the Government by going sole source, they need to demonstrate so to the Government.  Your documentation should be submitted to Engineering Field Activity, Northwest, Attn:  Cindy Harley, 19917 7th Avenue NE, Poulsbo, WA 98370-7570 no later than 4:00 p.m. local time on (insert date).  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed work based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>A -- Adaptive Photonic Phase-Locked Elements (APPLE)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-04-PKDA-APPLE
<ARCHDATE>11122004
<CONTACT>Mark Wade, Contract Negotiator, Phone (937) 255-2206, Email Mark.Wade@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR Adaptive Photonic Phase-Locked Elements (APPLE).   The technical areas of interest are all technologies required to build an array of sub-apertures capable of transmitting, receiving, and rapidly steering spatially phased optical energy and images in which each sub-aperture should be transmissive.   AFRL and DARPA are interested in demonstrating a modular, scaleable architecture capable of scaling to large apertures and high powers. Objective at program’s end is for the components, as well as the entire system, to be available commercially.  Compensating for atmospheric effects is required as part of any technical approach.  Primary wavelengths are approximately 1.5 microns and 1 micron.  The Government contemplates a program which would consist of 2 or 3 phases.  The first phase is expected to be 12 months.  The total program length is expected to be up to 5 years. 

Goals for the first phase include: transmissive optical phased array sub-aperture elements of 2 cm diameter or more.  Actual shape of the sub-aperture elements is a trade space item. Less than 2 msec beam switching time, greater than 50 percent fill array factor, and, an array strell ratio of at least 60 percent, and imaging on receive with resolution at least a factor of two beyond the diffraction limited resolution of a single sub-aperture.   The array of sub-apertures should include at least one sub-aperture surrounded on all sides by other sub-apertures.  Nonmechanical beam steering should be continuous to at least 20 degrees in any direction, covering a field of regard of at least 40 degrees.  Algorithms should be demonstrated to allow for necessary atmospheric compensation to meet final program goals.  Over-all transmission efficiency from electrical power to far field energy steered to 20 degrees in any direction should exceed 1 percent, and be higher for smaller angle beam steering. 

Goals for the final phase are expected to be as follows:
Demonstration of a half meter array of sub-apertures using 100 or fewer sub-apertures, including the ability to compensate for any atmospheric effects in real time.  The demonstrated technology should be scaleable to powers of at least 100 kW for the weapon application and one or more kilowatts for the sensing application.   A significant fraction of those power levels should be demonstrated in this program.  An array fill factor of greater then 90 percent is desired and a strell ratio greater than 90 percent.  Efficiency from electrical power to a far field transmitted beam steered to a 45 degree angle in any direction should exceed 7 percent.   Total efficiency at smaller steering angles should be higher.  Imaging resolution through moderate turbulence should be within a factor of 1.5 of a monolithic unsteered beam emitted from a half meter aperture through clear air or vacuum.  Steering time should be under 1 millisecond from any location in the field of regard to any other location.  As a goal any sub-aperture, or any combinations of sub-apertures, should be capable of being used independently for all functions. 
   
Vendors who are capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interest and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered.  Other business opportunities for the Air Force Research Laboratory are available at www.fedbizopps.gov.  Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement. Reference Numbered Note 25.***

Note 22*** The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The US Department of State (DOS), Office of Logistics Management (A/LM/AQM), on behalf of the Overseas Building Operations, Security Management (OBO/PE/SM) is seeking firms to provide site security personnel Cleared American Guards (CAGS) and Construction Surveillance Technicians (CSTS) for various domestic locations and overseas construction sites and storage areas.  At a minimum, the construction security services personnel will be required to, a) detect unauthorized access into controlled areas; b) surveil the activities of uncleared workers to prevent the implantation of clandestine surveillance devices or systems into the structure being constructed, or its surroundings.
Offerors will be required to provide double rates for domestic and overseas personnel to be eligible for award.  Personnel providing CAG and CST services both domestically and overseas, must successfully complete the Department's specialized security training prior to contract assignment.  The government anticipates awarding at least three Indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts with at least one award set-aside for small business.  Each contract shall consist of a one-year base period with four one-year option service periods.  The minimum for each contract is anticipated to be 250K in task orders over the life of a 5-year period.  All offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry to be eligible for award.  Offerors can contact the CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423.  Special Note:  In order to be eligible to perform under this contract, the successful offerors must possess or be able to obtain a Department of Defense (DOD) Top Secret facility clearance, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M.  All personnel providing CAG and CST services must also possess a Top Secret personnel security clearance issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO).  Offerors already possessing the necessary facility clearance should submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with their proposal.  If a selected offeror does not possess the necessary facility clearance, the Department of State will sponsor the firm for a facility clearance.  Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance.  A period of up to 90 calendar days from the date of final selection of the final offeror(s) will be allowed for the selected firm(s) to obtain the necessary facility clearance.  After this period, the Government may, at its discretion, consider awarding the contract to another firm.  Firms which form joint ventures must also comply with the above facility clearance and personnel security clearance requirements.  This is not a Request for Proposal.  The estimated issue date for the Request for Proposals is on or about November 17, 2004 and a modification shall be issued to this announcement requesting a proposal from all interested parties.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement BAA W909MY-05-R-0004, soliciting white papers for applied research in Fuel Cell technology has been posted on the Single Face to Industry website, https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  This is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), W 909MY-05-R-0004, sponsored by the U. S. Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Research, Development and Engineering Center (RDEC), valid through fiscal year 2007, unless sooner terminated.  This BAA is issued under provisions of paragraph 6.102(d )(2) and paragraph 35.016 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for competitive selection of research and development proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  Accordingly, proposals selected for award are considered to be  the result of full and open competition and fully compliant with PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  Prospective offerors should note that this BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award o r pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this announcement.  The cost of proposal preparation for response to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract.  However, it may be an allowa ble expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Funds are not presently available for the research interests represented in this BAA.  No contract award will be made unless appropriated funds are available for payment for the effort being acquired.  Prospective offerors are reminded that only a duly warranted Contracting Officer may obligate the Government.  Any resultant contract award would include all clauses required by Federal Acquisition Regulations and appropriat e supplements.  This BAA is intended for the development of research efforts in fuel cell technology in support of the RDEC Army Power Division.  Fuel cell technology is one of the key research and development candidates for advanced power sources. The US Army is interested in receiving proposals for basic and applied research, development, and demonstration of lightweight, robust, cost effective fuel cell power sources, associated technology and associated components for use in various mobile and portable applications ranging from less than one watt to five kilowatts.  Research and development of fuel cell stack auxiliary components such as pumps, fans, valves, electronics controls, and other technologies that are associated with fuel cell technology are al so acceptable as a separate item or as part of a larger research and development proposal. Hybrid technologies utilizing energy sources such as batteries are acceptable under this topic as long as they are fuel cell based and provide enhanced capabilities.  These technologies shall utilize liquid fuel directly, or shall process liquid fuels into a suitable fuel source for use in fuel cell technology demonstrations, or employ hydrogen storage/generation technology as a source of hydrogen. Fuel processing tech nology research, development, and demonstration with emphasis placed on logistics fuel (diesel, JP8) reforming for direct use in fuel cell power sources is also acceptable as a separate item or as part of a larger research and development proposal. The sou rce of hydrogen or type of fuel under this topic is open; however, consideration should be given to cost, practicality, and safety implications.  Potential offerors are reminded that only a duly warranted contracting officer may obligate the government to an agreement involving the expenditure of Government funds.  In order for any proposals to be considered, the proposed effort MUST meet the definition of basic or applied research and development found at FAR 35.001.  Submission of White Papers is mandator y prior to submission of a full proposal.  The selection of one or more proposals for award will be based on a peer and scientific evaluation of each offerors r esponse (to include both technical and cost aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement.  White Papers/Proposals shall be submitted in electronic format via the Army Single Face to Industry Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP).  The URL for the IBOP is https://abop.monmouth.army.mil. The IBOP submittal shall include an electronic signature by an individual having authority to enter into a contract.  In order to be able to access the BAA solicitation W90 9MY-05-R-0004 and submit a white paper, a contractor must first be registered on the IBOP.   A CAGE Code and DUNS number are required to complete registration for proposal submissions.  A contractor employee who is authorized to bind the contractor must co mplete the registration.  The process could take several days to finalize the registration and contractors are encouraged to register as soon as possible.   Proposals shall be submitted via electronic media using Microsoft Office 2000 products (i.e., Micro soft ® Word and Excel, and Adobe Acrobat version 4.0), in separate files for each proposal volume as set forth below. All information pertaining to a particular volume shall be confined to that file. There will be no formal request for proposal or any furt her solicitation document issued in regard to this BAA.  Therefore, interested parties should be alert for any amendments that maybe published.  Amendments to this BAA will be issued through the Army Single Face to Industry Interactive Business Opportuniti es Page (IBOP) at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.

The receipt time and date for one-page Notice of Interest response(s) is hereby revised to 4 PM Eastern Standard Time, November 3rd, 2004.  Notice of Interest must be received by the Contracting Officer at 590 Herndon Parkway, Suite 120, Herndon, VA  20170


Question 2:  May the Notice of Interest be sent electronically (email) to your attention?

Response to Question 2:  No. A hard copy of the Notice of Interest must be received by TSA Contracting Officer.  Address is re-affirmed in the Response to Question 1.


Question 3:  What is the current anticipated date for release of the solicitation (SOW) to the QVL pool?  Accordingly, what is the anticipated due date for proposals and award date for the various sections?

Response to Question 3:  The Statement of Work (SOW) will be released with the Request for Proposals after the QVL is established. The TSA anticipates competitive award(s) in the 1st Quarter of FY 2005. 


Question 4:  Specifically, personnel and pricing appear to be requested based on the evaluation criteria and the requirement for a GSA Federal Supply Schedule, but how do we present this information within the limitations of the one-page Notice of Interest?  Are you expecting labor categories to be provided, as well as on-site and off-site rates?

Response to Question 4: The announcement does not request pricing and personnel data at this time.  The announcement requirement for relevant past performance qualifications requires interested parties submitting a notice of interest to identify the value of cited past performance contracts.  This value will be used to assist TSA with determining how cited past performance compares to the anticipated scope of PMO requirements. 


Question  5:  What is the estimated contract value for each section or current contract value of services provided by incumbents?
 
Response to Question 5:  The requirements addressed within FEDBIZOPs announcement have been provided over the past five years by the following companies (total contract value estimated):

JIL Information Systems (Program Management Support) -- $24 million over past 5 years;
NGMS (Data Collection & Analysis, and ILS Support) -- $18 million over the past 5 years;
Battelle Memorial Inst. (IV&V Support) -- $33 million over past 5 years;
Raytheon Technical Services Corporation (Security Equipment Integration) – less than $5 million over past 5 years for engineering services portion of contract. 


Question 6:  In the PreSolicitation Notice excerpt below, the first sentence discusses CTO requirements, but the rest of the notice refers (numerous times) to PMO requirements.  I can find no CTO organization described on the DHS website, and wonder if that CTO should actually be PMO?  If CTO is correct, could you please provide a brief description or link to a description of that part of DHS?
 
Response to Question 6:  CTO refers to the Transportation Security Administration Office of Security which is headed by the Chief Technology Officer.  This requirement is for the Program Management Office (PMO) support services required by the CTO to support the TSA mission.  Recommend looking at TSA website for data on CTO. 


Question 7:  In order to know how many past performance examples to submit, would you please quantify the anticipated scope (personnel and price) of the "(1) Management Services" requirements?

Response to Question 7:  Historical size of requirement is identified in answer to Question #5. 


Question 8:  What is the preferred method of submittal, postal mail, email, or fax?  If you don not have a preferred method, we will most likely email it to you.

Response to Question 8:  Please see responses to Questions #1 and #2.


Question 9:  How do we get our Firm added to the Federal Business Opportunities email list?
 
Response to Question 9: TSA does not manage, control or influence the FEDBIZOPs process.  Therefore, any request for incorporation on a Federal Business Opportunities e-mail list must be addressed with FEDBIZOPs management.


Question 10:  Please provide the following incumbent information for the STDO PMO requirement(s):  Contractor; Incumbent Contract; and Expiration Date. 
 
Response to Question 10:  The response to Question #5 identifies incumbent names and estimated contract value (over a 5 year period).  The expiration date for all contracts is 31 December 2004.  Contract numbers are:

JIL Information:  DTFA01-98-C-01003

Question 13:  Items (1), (3), and (4) are indicated as 100% small-business set-aside procurements; will small companies with large companies as subcontractors be allowed to compete?

Question 16:  Reference the Presolicitation Notice for STDO PMO Support (HSTS04-05-R-DEP976), you are planning for 3 of the 6 contracts to be awarded to small businesses.  It was not clear whether the small business awards would be restricted to businesses of certain size.  Could you please tell me what the NAICS code size standards are for the proposed small business set-asides

Response to Question 16:  Please see responses to Questions #13, and #14.

Question 17:  If our company bids a team do you want past performance quals from the subs?

Response to Question 17:  Each interested party that submits a notice of interest should identify the qualifications of their company.  If the company is proposing to use a key subcontractor, their notice of interest can address this.  


Question 18:  Can the 100% set aside offerors bid a team?

Response to Question 18:  Yes.


Question 19:  Are you able to be on multiple teams?

Response to Question 19: Yes.


Question 20:  You are listed as the contact person for the subject RFP. I was wondering if there is a list my company could be added to as a potential subcontractor?

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement pursuant to FAR 35.016(c).  Previous modifications are incorporated into this republishing, as well as the deletion of the recommended dates for submission of white papers in FY 05 and FY 06.  White papers can be submitted up until the closing date of 30 September 2006.  No other changes have been made.


Points of Contact: George Brost, AFRL Program Manager, (315) 330-7669, email: George.Brost@rl.af.mil, Lori Smith, Contracting Officer, (315) 330-1955, email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. All questions prior to the submission of a technical and cost proposal, including inquires regarding white papers should be addressed to the AFRL Program Manager, George Brost.  

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors Directorate, Photonics Processing Branch, Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to advance the technology in the area of microwave photonics, addressing the application of photonics technology to the generation, distribution, and processing of analog microwave signals as well as the application of photonics to the digitization of microwave signals. Areas of interest include devices, components, techniques, systems and applications. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, efficient external modulators, high power detectors, low RIN sources, highly linear modulators, optical techniques for microwave signal generation, low pulse jitter lasers for analog to digital converters, analog fiber optic links, true time delay, optical control of phased array antennas, optical signal processors, integration of photonic devices and circuits, system design and modeling. Deliverables will include technical reports and, when appropriate, technology demonstrations to prove out the concepts proposed and components and devices developed. Principal funding for proposals selected from this announcement begins in FY01. Individual awards will not normally exceed twenty-four (24) months in duration, with dollar amounts normally ranging from $100,000 to $1,000,000. Total funding for the BAA is $4,950,000. Foreign allied participation is allowed at the prime contractor level.  

THIS PUBLICATION ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a two (2) to ten (10) page white paper on their proposed research topic to: Air Force Research Laboratory/SNDP, ATTN: Mr. George Brost, 25 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4115. White papers must reference BAA 01-05-IFKPA. White papers will be accepted until 30 Sep 2006, however, it is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY01-16 Apr 2001, FY02-30 Jan 2002, FY03-30 Jan 2003, FY04-30 Jan 2004, FY05/06 – 1 Oct 04 through 30 Sep 06. Multiple white papers addressing different areas of applicability may be submitted by each offeror and are encouraged. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Offeror; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Each white paper will be evaluated within thirty days of receipt and a letter will be sent to each offeror either encouraging or discouraging the submission of a proposal. Offerors of those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA will be invited to submit a proposal. Complete proposal instructions will be contained in the letter requesting a proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract. It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Proposals submitted as the result of a favorable white paper will be evaluated as they are received. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement. Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (1) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, (2) The potential contributions of the effort to the Air Force Research Laboratory mission, (3) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives, (4) The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives; and (5) Cost Benefits. The technical and cost information will be evaluated simultaneously. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  An informational briefing is not planned, but may be scheduled should conditions warrant. A copy of the AFRL/IFK "BAA & PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html. All responsible organizations may submit a white paper, which shall be considered. Respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission, reference BAA 01-05-IFKPA. All responses to this announcement must reference the above topic as well as BAA-01-05-IFKPA. This announcement is open and effective until 30 Sep 2006. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<SOLNBR>14350405RFI40718
<RESPDATE>112904
<ARCHDATE>10272005
<CONTACT>Shanda Georg Business Specialist 7037871758     Shanda.Georg@mms.gov;
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI 40718) - Sources Sought for a National Indian Arts and Crafts Activity Market Survey The Department of Interior, Indian Arts and Crafts Board (IACB) seeks to undertake a nationwide market study in order to define and illuminate the Indian arts and crafts market.    This is a market survey for a written request for information (RFI) only.  It is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the government.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and/or any follow-up information requests.  Responses shall not exceed 30 pages and standard company brochures are not desired.  Dependent upon the results of this market survey, the IACB may issue a solicitation to acquire the appropriate services.  Any such solicitation will be based on a statement of objectives and will be issued as a firm fixed price effort. The IACB was created by Congress to promote American Indian and Alaska Native economic development through the expansion of the Indian arts and crafts market.  The top priority of the IACB is the enforcement and implementation of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, Pub. L.  101-644, 25 U.S.C. § 305a et seq, as amended by the Indian Arts and Crafts Enforcement Act of 2000, Pub.L. 106-497, 25 U.S.C. § 305e (the "Act"), enacted in response to growing sales of arts and crafts products misrepresented as being produced by Indians.  The Act is a truth-in-advertising law that prohibits the marketing of products as "Indian made" when such products are not made by Indians as defined by the Act.  It is intended to protect Indian artists and craftspeople, businesses, Tribes, and consumers.  For purposes of the Act, "Indian" is defined as a member of a federally or officially state recognized Tribe or certified non-member Indian artisan.  See 25 U.S.C. 305e(d)(1) and (3); 25 C.F.R. 309.2.  The IACB works to protect the economic livelihood of authentic Indian artists and artisans, and provides protection for consumers, through public education, industry outreach, and enforcement.  There have been no recent market studies to define the size and impact of Indian arts and crafts production and sales on Indian economic development.  Such a study is needed to clarify, for example, the nature and scope of producers, wholesalers, and jobbers of Indian arts and crafts, how the products are getting to retail, and who is buying the products.  The more in-depth the information on the sources of and distribution channels for Indian arts and crafts entering the marketplace, the greater the IACB's ability to bolster Indian economic development and cultural preservation through the production and sales of authentic Indian arts and crafts. Previous studies have included the "Comprehensive Study of the American Indian Arts and Crafts Situation in the Albuquerque, Navajo, and Phoenix Areas," (1976) by the American Indian Management Institute; "The History of the Southwest Indian Ethnic Art Market," (1976) a doctoral dissertation by Edwin Wade; "Study of Problems and Possible Remedies Concerning Imported Native American-Style Jewelry and Handicrafts," (1985) by the U.S. Department of Commerce; "Santa Fe Indian Market 2001," by the University of New Mexico for the Southwestern Association of Indian Arts; and "Native American Art in the International Marketplace and Pertinent Information on Native American Arts," (2002) by Allison Consultants for the Northern Arizona University Center for American Indian Economic Development.  These studies have, with the exception of the 1985 Department of Commerce study, focused on arts and crafts sales in the Southwest.  While these studies and reports help to shed light on the industry from several perspectives, they do not provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the Indian arts and crafts market nationwide that is currently required. Accordingly, the study will include identification of: A.	The size (by revenue and/or other recognized indicators) of the overall Indian arts and crafts market. B.	Determine the number and location of individual Indian artists and artisans who support themselves exclusively through the sale of their art or craftwork. C.	Determine the number and location of individual Indian artists and artisans who supplement their income through the sale of their art or craftwork. D.	Determine the number and location of retail businesses of which the majority of their products are Indian arts and crafts.   E.	Determine the number and location of wholesale businesses of which the majority of their products are Indian arts and crafts. F.	Categorize and further define the number of individuals, businesses, and organizations that sell their products through established art markets, powwows, conferences, and related events. G.	Following identification of the market components, further describe the sales by categories such as Individual, Retail, Market Vendor, Street Vendor, Internet, or Other. H.	Principal geographic areas of production of authentic market items by craft category, (e.g., jewelry, pottery, beadwork, basketry, Alaskan crafts, weaving, fetish, sculpture, carvings, kachina, or other), and tribal affiliation of the producer. I.	Principal geographic areas and/or markets of distribution of authentic market items by the above craft categories, including venues beyond the producer's immediate area. J.	Identification of significant producers and distributors of Indian arts and crafts and discussion of their methodology, organization, and other pertinent information related to their operation and control of the market.  K.	Determine what percentage of the overall American craft market is made up of the sale of Indian arts and crafts products.   L.	Obtain pertinent financial information regarding the sales of Indian arts and crafts by individuals, and retail and wholesale businesses. M.	Identify location and profile of Indian arts and crafts collectors and repeat consumers. Each prospective vendor is to provide a capability statement addressing its knowledge, ability and experience, and brief outline of approach, including a rough order of magnitude (ROM) of cost, for each of the following key categories.   1.	Data collection and analysis. 2.	Product marketing and merchandising. 3.	Identification and tracking of Indian arts and crafts sales by product category as noted above in "H." 4.	Creation of manufacturer, seller and buyer profiles. 5.	Familiarity with Indian and Alaska Native culture, customs, markets, geography, economics, and any other knowledge, experience or ability pertinent to gaining credible access to relevant markets and market participants. 6.	Past performance of similar work All potential sources with the capability to provide the above referenced requirements are invited to submit, in writing, sufficient information within the page limitation (30 pages).  This information must demonstrate the prospective vendor's ability to fulfill the requirements.  All responses must identify capabilities/expertise in all the above requirements. It is the intent of the government to conduct informal, interactive exchanges with prospective vendors who provide capability statements in accordance with this market survey request.  The government may invite one or more respondents to discuss their capability of performing similar commercial activities, experiences, and current business best practices.  The information obtained from this market survey and informal exchange will be used to form the basis of a future solicitation.   All responses must be received not later than November 29, 2004, 2PM Eastern Standard Time. All documents and materials submitted in response to this RFI will become the property of the government, and will not be turned Responses will be marked as follows:  "Market Survey RFI 40718" and include with the capability statement:  Vendor company name, address, name of the point of contact, email address, phone number and fax number, and vendor's DUNS number. Responses may be emailed in zip format to :  shanda.georg@mms.gov or mailed to the following address (if hard copies are sent, please provide 3 copies): Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, Procurement Operations, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon Virginia 20170-4817  Attention:  Shanda Georg

The results should hyperlink the location within the website for user 'one-click' access to the information.

5. The software should contain an algorithm (proprietary or configurable) that "learns" from input provided by the user concerning applicability of the resultant query lists. As users indicate satisfaction with a particular document/solution presented in response to their query, the algorithm 'weights' the document/solution to be presented higher in the list order for exact or similar queries presented by other users.

6. The software should enable Natural Language Query (NLQ), precluding the necessity of users to learn a specific query language in order to obtain query results. This requirement is not contradictory to other forms of user input, such as radio-button selections or list drop downs, neither of which require the user to learn a specific query language.

7. The software must be warranted by the manufacturer to perform as advertised, and must be supported by technical support that responds within a reasonable timeframe to configuration issues or trouble reports.

8. The software should incorporate new documents/html "on the fly" without administrator intervention and place them appropriately within the directory's algorithm. Similarly, the software should remove from its algorithm documents/html that have been removed by the administrators.

9. The software should incorporate time-configurable document 'aging' that alerts the administrator to documents or html that have exceeded the threshold for relevant information.

<DESC>RDECOM CERDEC C4ISR Systems Engineering Request for Information Solicitation Objective:  RDECOM CERDEC is soliciting information regarding candidate solutions, concepts, and technologies related to FCS, WIN-T, JTRS, DCGS-A, ACS, Current Force Spirals and other network-centric C4ISR programs of record for consideration as systems engineering so lutions to relevant issues and for potential experimentation in the FY 05  FY 08 C4ISR OTM testbed.  The goal is to explore, analyze, and implement engineering approaches as a tangible method to test the very complex System of Systems, Network-Centric War fare concepts. Problem Definition: As the Army embarks on architecting, designing, and fielding the Future Force battlefield where information and services are relayed directly from the sensor to the shooter, we realize we must iteratively prove out these concepts and technologies in a syst em of system environment.  Following the outstanding track record of the Ft. Dix/Ft. Monmouth C4ISR OTM demonstration, RDECOM CERDEC recommends continuing that success with focus towards a more network-centric environment to emulate features of FCS, JTRS, WIN-T, DCGS-A, ACS, and Current Force Spiral programs.  As each of these acquisition programs have different prime contractors working towards various phases, RDECOM CERDEC is initiating an independent test bed to prove out and enhance Future Force concept s in an integrated, joint environment which will benefit the acquisition community. Factors for Task Selection/Focus Areas: Priorities will be given to those C4ISR RFI submittals that address Capability Gaps; has a System of Systems benefit (interrelated benefit to companion systems, neither of which wholly own the problem); remedies a Force Protection issue (addresses a known or emerging soldier or force safety issue); solves a Declared PM/User need  potential of advancing an immature critical technology (CT) or future operational capability (FOC); is Urgent and improves a program or fielding schedule demand.   All of these su ggestions will be evaluated to determine how many pressing issues can be addressed simultaneously.  All solutions considered will ensure military efficiencies, keeping in mind system cost, performance, and schedule. Mature solutions will have to be releasa ble, maintain an open architecture/open standards concept, and coordinated with program sponsor for use.  Efforts that exhibit teaming among parties to address system of systems issues will be viewed favorably as compared to discrete point solution suggest ions.  After all the RFI submittals are reviewed, the C4ISR OTM system engineering committee will assess and prioritize high payoff initiatives.    Goals: Some of the evolving goals of the FY05-08 C4ISR Systems Engineering efforts: * Verify and/or question requirements  * Prove technical viability * Reaffirm essential elements of analysis, Measures of Performance (MOPs), Measure of Effectiveness (MOEs), Concept of Operations (CONOPs) and/or perhaps break the mold and create new C4ISR CONOPS, MOEs, and MOPs * Capture performance data and trend analysis on operational performance * Pinpoint gaps in capability and areas for further research * Recommend tech base and acquisitions investments to fill voids * Balance high risk/high payoff with near term lower risk return-on-investment * Assess acquisition maturity * Gauge field worthiness * Address C4ISR challenges that represent system voids demanding immediate developmental engineering * Tackle current force issues for which solutions would offer substantial capability or force protection enhancements * Undertake problems for which theory and analytical data isnt convincing enough; demanding more extensive modeling and simulation and live experimentation Benefits to Industry The C4ISR OTM testbed is a high visibility joint experiment showcasing emerging C4ISR technologies in an integrated joint environment.  Air Force, Navy, Army and Jo int services have participated with their latest technologies and warfighters.  Senior officials from all services, including the Chief of Staff of Army, have witnessed such experiments.  Industry has adopted some of the featured technologies in their acqu isition programs.   Timeline: The Future Force emulation concept will initiate its system of system integration testing in Summer 2005 and continuously throughout subsequent years until FY08.  Thus, some candidate technologies and systems solicited need to be mature enough to meet the FY05 goal while other concepts can mature to fall within each yearly C4ISR OTM experiment. RFI Directions Submissions are NTE 10 pages with less than 2 pages of graphics. Prepare submissions with an executive summary NTE 2 pages.   Include a separate Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of Costs for annual expenses and cost share considerations. Clearly lay out schedules emphasizing which technologies will be mature enough to be demonstrated in which years. Submit information NLT 18 Nov 04. List all federal government programs with contract numbers your company participated in.

<SUBJECT>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR JOINT UNMANNED SYSTEMS COMMON CONTROL
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY (RFI)!  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC-PC) at Panama City, FL is requesting information from industry for a new integrated capability to concurrently manage multiple unmanned systems of all types (air, sea surface, undersea, and ground), and to do so with an application of joint messaging standards that will help lead to the eventual state where most unmanned systems across all the services are truly interoperable.  THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE, BUT RATHER A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY from industry on existent planning tools and other software or algorithm products that could potentially add functional value to a standards-based open architecture.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and NSWC-PC will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Responders are solely responsible for all expen! ses associated with responding to this RFI.  At present, a single architecture that allows for the concurrent management of large numbers of unmanned systems of all types using joint interoperability standards, is non-proprietary, scaleable and open to support expansion and affordable technology refresh does not exist. The primary goal of the NAVSURFWARCEN Panama City's Joint Unmanned Systems Common Control (JUSC2) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) is to integrate select Commercial and Government Off-the-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies, legacy systems, and emergent joint standards to provide a first spiral development of such an architecture, and to develop and demonstrate a Joint Concept of Operations that will enhance the joint force commander's ability to conduct effective joint and coalition operations.  The approach to this program is not an attempt to build a single common control system, but to federate separate USV, UAV, USV, and UGV common control segm! ents onto a common LAN with open architecture standards applied in two areas.  The first area is Joint interoperability messaging standards (Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems, or JAUS and NATO STANAGs for UAVs) being developed within DoD that will be applied to unmanned R&D systems currently in development.  Select systems are being modified to conform to the joint standards and inter-service operation and control hand-off will be demonstrated.  For select unmanned systems that are already in the acquisition program stage, plans and estimated cost & schedule for joint standards conversion will be developed.  The second area of standards application is within the local area network (LAN) that integrates the separate control segments into a common system.  Open Architecture (OA) standards will be applied to the processing segments to ensure that new capabilities or individual unmanned systems can be inserted into the architecture with a minimum of change required to the ! overall system to maintain affordability and configuration control.  The separate legacy control segments, once integrated, communicate with a higher level common unmanned systems management system/operator interface that applies the functions shown in the left column of Attachment 1 to produce a capability to concurrently manage large numbers of all types of unmanned systems.  The purpose of this RFI is to gather information on technologies that could be relevant for consideration for technology refresh of this architecture beyond the ACTD, which has a near-term focus on the Littoral Combat ship.  The intent is to explore further development for broader joint unmanned systems applications across all services.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses. This RFI seeks descriptions of candidate technologies that potentially offer one or more of the capabilities listed in the table (Att! achment 1).  Additionally, a synopsis should be included in the submission to include, but not be limited to the following: Conceptual Alternatives, Feasibility Assessment, Estimated Cost and Schedule Estimates, Corporate Expertise, and any other suggestions or discussion the respondent deems appropriate. In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach, security requirements, security assurance processes, and any relevant lessons learned.  In addition to a synopsis, submissions must include the prescribed format in the attachment to this synopsis for ease of review and prioritization.  This is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.   Responders should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.  All information received in ! response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  NSWC-PC may hold an information exchange meeting to discuss this RFI with interested potential respondents.  Details about this meeting will be made available at a later date.  If you wish to attend such a meeting please notify the synopsis contact.   All correspondence related to this matter should be e-mailed (preferred) in Microsoft Office format to Allan.Ziemba@navy.mil, faxed to (850)234-4251, or mailed to arrive no later then the 3:00 PM on 12 November 2004 DON-SNOTE-041027-001 Attachment 1 For each technology product candidate, make entries in the appropriate blank columns in Table 1.

<SUBJECT>A -- Development and Commercialization of Agents for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Tumors Expressing EPO Receptor
<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Collaborator to work with NINDS in the development, manufacture and commercialization of agents for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors expressing EPO receptor (EPOR). Of particular interest are agents useful in diagnosis or treatment of multiple tumors in different organs in patients with von Hippel-Landau (VHL) disease, sporadic kidney tumors and kidney tumors in dialysis patients.  NINDS is seeking a development and commercialization partner for identification of agents that act as antagonist to EPO, especially ligands that bind EPOR but do not activate the receptor.

Potential Areas of Application
·	Treatment and diagnosis of multiple tumors in different organs in patients with von Hippel- Landau patients
·	Treatment and diagnosis of renal tumors in sporadic and kidney dialysis patients
·	Treatment and diagnosis of pheochromocytomas in sporadic and hypertension patients
·	Treatment and diagnosis of eye and CNS hemangioblastomas 

Main Advantages of Technology/Invention:
·	We have found co-expression of EPO and EPOR in tumors of VHL patients. The co-expression of the ligand and receptor are related to the tumor growth and progression. Since the co-expression of EPO and EPOR are not present in most normal adult tissues, ligands that bind to EPOR but not activate the receptor can target specific tumor cells with minimal detrimental effect on normal cells. 
·	Since co-expression of EPO and EPOR is only transiently present in early embryo cells, detection of the co-expression of these proteins in tumor cells can be used for diagnosis of specific tumor cells.

Current State of Development
·	In vitro studies of tumor cell samples from a variety of tumors from von Hippel-Landau patients indicate that expression of EPOR is upregulated in these tumor cells.
·	Some of the tumor cell lines such as a kidney tumor cell line have been developed. Other tumor cell lines such as hemangioblastoma cell line from VHL patient can be cultured in the presence of EPO in the culture media. These cell lines can be used to test the effect of EPO agonist and antagonist on their growth.

<SUBJECT>D -- Request for Information - Technology Review
<DESC>The Commerce Business Systems (CBS) Support Center has been tasked to examine the underlying technology base of the Department of Commerce (DoC) Core Financial System (CFS) and predict the usability, sustainability, and extensibility of the underlying technology base.  The Commerce Business Systems (CBS) Support Center seeks information from Industry on how best to accomplish this objective and to facilitate development of requirements for the study.

BACKGROUND

The Department of Commerce has implemented a Department-wide financial information system to support its full range of financial management activities.  This system, the Commerce Business System (CBS) has and will continue to improve financial management Department-wide by automating redundant, error-prone manual functions and by streamlining many financial management processes through a re-engineering of the way the agency does business.  The system standardizes and integrates several subsidiary systems and eliminates the need to maintain several accounting systems in Commerce.

CBS is comprised of a standard Core Financial System (CFS) which is integrated with Department-wide functional systems for time reporting, payroll, data warehouse, and purchasing.  It was acquired as a COTS product in 1994 and has been modified to fully support Departmental business functions.  CBS is also be linked with those bureau-specific systems that capture financial transactions and/or support general ledger improvements and standardization of administrative management processes across the Department and greatly improves the quality and timeliness of financial and administrative data urgently needed for sound program management decisions.  The CFS is connected to a data warehouse where bureaus can get data on budget and costs refreshed daily.

CBS is maintained by the CBS Support Center (CSC) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, which is responsible for the programming, testing, design control, change management, training, documentation, and other activities associated with the maintenance and deployment of the CBS software.  The CSC provides maintenance through a set of contract vehicles with technical contractors managed by the CSC staff.

The CFS environment is based on Oracle’s integrated product suite, Oracle RDBMS Installed with Distributed Option software developed in PL/SQL, Forms, C programs, and UNIX Shell Scripts.  The CFS Data Warehouse, a “read-only” reporting environment, is implemented using Oracle RDBMS Java enabled with Server The User can access data via Oracle Forms, and additional OLAP tools such as Discoverer. 

The Government is looking for the following information:

(1)  What is entailed in doing this type of work?
(2)  What kind of information should be provided and requested?
(3)  What kinds of resources are necessary?
(4)  What would be a reasonable timeframe for accomplishing the work?
(5)  What would be the parameters for performing a trade off analysis of SQL-based system versus other approaches, i.e. looking at the Oracle path versus other paths?  Currently under consideration is to request that the contractor should look at technical cost, effort and cost to switch to other approach, and availability skilled work force for other approach.
(6)  What does it mean to change the language of CFS—what is involved?
(7)  What new investment will CBS have to make if CFS is re-developed/converted to another technology?
(8)  What would be the licensing costs for development and deployment if we changed technology vendors?
(9)  What are the elements in determining how useable, sustainable, and extensible is the current CFS technology?  Do we need to separate this question from usability, sustainability and extendibility of Oracle?
(10) What are the inventory of elements/ considerations that go into technology being usable, sustainable, and extensible
(11) What does the private sector do to extend the life of their enterprise business systems; what technologies do their systems employ? What is their underlying technology?  What hardware and software do they use? What are the technologies used in ERP vendor products like SAP, People soft, Oracle Financials, AMS/Momentum?

Responses are required no later than 5:00 p.m. (EST) on November 12, 2004 and can be sent to Carol Silverman, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at csilverman@doc.gov, facsimile transmission to 301-258-4525, or mail to CAMS Support Center, 209 Perry Parkway, Suite 5, Gaithersburg, MD  20877.

This is a request for information only.  There is no solicitation.

<SUBJECT>--Industry Outreach Conference for Improvised Explosive Devices
<DESC>Major General Fred D. Robinson, Chairman of the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Integrated Process Team (JIEDDIPT) invites you to participate in a conference focused on meeting the threat of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) to be held on N ovember 18, 2004.  This one-day Conference will be at the SECRET level.  The Conference will provide industry with critical information on the IED threat, promote the exchange of information with industry, and support future IED solicitations.  The Confere nce Agenda will feature overview briefings of the IED threat and the DoD response in the morning.  Five breakout sessions focused on the following five tenets are planned in afternoon:  (a) Predict/Preempt  Activities that contribute to detection through forecast of specific enemy operations; (b) Detect  Activities that contribute to the location and identification of enemy devices and handlers, carriers, and detonators either pre or post device initiation/detonation; (c) Prevent  Activities that disrupt  the mechanisms and structures that support enemy operations; (d) Neutralize  Activities that contribute to the destruction, reduction, or safe removal of the emerging threat device/object; and (e) Mitigation  Activities that contribute to the reduction of the emerging threat effect on its intended target after initiation/detonation.  In addition to providing a better understanding of the IED challenge facing the Department, there will be time on the agenda to meet one-on-one with individuals from the JIE DDIPT to discuss specific threats, potential technical solutions, and to obtain initial industry feedback.  The conference is being held at Fort Belvoir, Virginia at the Defense Acquisition University.  Because of limited seating we are requesting that no more than three individuals from any one company or business unit of large firms register for the conference.  To register or find out more about the Conference, go to http://www.acq.osd.mil/actd/IEDIOC2004/.  Registration will remain open until capacity o f the conference facility is reached.

<SUBJECT>--Meeting notice  -  Army Biotechnology Working Group Briefings on Alternative Business Practices for Industry & Academia
<DESC>E-mail:  armybwg.meeting@aplmsg.jhuapl.edu Army Biotechnology Working Group Briefings on Alternative Business Practices for Industry & Academia DRAFT (22 October 2004) The Armys Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) has formed a Biotechnology Working Group (BWG) to begin to identify and coordinate potential biotechnology-based solutions to a broad range of non-medical Army needs.  One of the objectives of the BWGs efforts is to begin to engage in an information exchange dialog with both the commercial biotechnology industry community as well as the academic biotechnology R&D community in order to (1) make these communities aware of Army needs and requir ements that are potentially amenable to biotechnology-based solutions and (2) learn from these communities what areas of ongoing work and/or research and development might have potential for addressing Army needs. 	An opportunity to initiate such an information exchange process on a limited basis has become available in conjunction with a meeting of the BWG currently planned to take place at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) in Laurel , MD on November 17.  On the afternoon of November 17, Army representatives will present a short overview of the BWGs current focus areas  followed by a series of briefings on alternative business practices for doing business with the Army that are availa ble and which may offer certain advantages over standard Department of Defense contractual arrangements. 	If you would like to have a representative of your organization attend this meeting or if you have questions regarding the meeting, please submit your request/questions via e-mail to the following address:  		armybwg.meeting@aplmsg.jhuapl.edu Include in your request the names of proposed attendees (please limit to 2 per organization), a short description of the type of work and/or research and development that your organization is involved in (please keep to one page or less), and an e-mail add ress for notification regarding the acceptance status of your request.  Since seating space in the auditorium is limited, how well organizational qualifications described in the information provided match Army needs and BWG focus areas may be used to deter mine whether or not to approve an attendance request. The meeting will take place from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, November 17, 2004 in the Parsons Auditorium at JHU/APL.  Directions may be found on the JHU/APL website at  http://www.jhuapl.edu.  Click on the Contacts/Maps button for general direct ions, lodging information, etc.  Under the Maps section, click on APL Campus for a layout of the campus.  The meeting location will be at the main entrance, labeled Lobby 1 (Main Lobby) with parking indicated as Visitor Parking immediately adjacent  to Lobby 1.  A detailed agenda for the meeting is currently being assembled and will be made available along with other information on the Events page of the JHU/APL website at the address listed above (click on About APL and then click on Events).

DESC:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR subpart 12. Solicitation number is OPM-RFQ-05-00003AMC and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation incorporates Federal Acquisition Regulation provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15. Incorporated by reference are FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; 52.2l2-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.  Additional FAR clauses apply. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541618, Other Management Consulting Services, with a small business size standard of $6 Million.

SCOPE OF PERFORMANCE:  The Center for Retirement and Insurance Service (CRIS) is a large-scale financial organization within the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Human Resources Products and Services, which administers the Civil Service and Federal Employees Retirement Systems (CSRS and FERS) programs, as well as the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, the Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance Program, Long Term Care and Flexible Spending Accounts.  

Annually, OPM contracts to have a comprehensive audit to examine the agency’s financial, accounting and fiduciary activities and present its opinion on the degree to which the agency’s systems, procedures and internal controls are in place and effective. In support of the annual audit of the agency’s financial statements, the goal of this solicitation is to ascertain, through statistical sampling and cohort analysis, the degree to which errors have been made in computation of entitlement payments for the 2.4 million retirees and survivors under the CSRS and FERS. The primary objective of these studies is to present to the auditor of record a set of calculations which enable OPM to objectively support its assertion that there is no material misstatement of annuitant payments. In addition, we seek to assure the auditor of record and most importantly those receiving benefits that the long term liability for future retiree and beneficiary payments is fairly stated; further, the Trust Fund liability is not understated, enabling us to continue uninterrupted payments into the future.  Finally, OPM must report an annual estimate of Overpayments, Underpayments and Total/Improper Payments in dollars and as a proportion of annual disbursements, in the agency’s Performance and Accountability Report (PAR).

EVALUATION OF OFFERS 

We will evaluate your proposal on the basis of your response to the technical factors listed below and your pricing.

This is a Best Value solicitation.  Technical merit is significantly more important than price.  We reserve the right to award a contract to a technically superior contractor who is higher in price.  When Technical Proposals are evaluated as essentially equal, price may become the deciding factor.  

Technical factors – These are the technical factors we will evaluate.  They are in descending order of importance.  The subfactors within Items A and B are also of equal importance. 

A.	Technical Approach: We will evaluate proposals based on the degree to which the offeror demonstrates an ability to provide the statistical support needed to meet the scope and objectives of the RFQ and an overall understanding of CSRS / FERS retirement benefits administration within the stated constraints.  This factor includes the offeror’s understanding of the RFQ as well as the suitability of the offeror’s approach to meeting our objectives.  We will evaluate proposals based on the subfactors below.  

	Product or Service Quality-availability to comply with the requirements stated this RFQ, the quality of those features, and degree to which the offeror’s auditing service capabilities meet our needs as specified in this Request for Quotation (RFQ).

	Qualifications/Staffing- the technical strength and expertise of the resources presented by the offeror and the offeror’s ability to deliver quality staff (if needed) over the life of the Blanket Purchase Agreement.  

B.	Past Performance – We will evaluate past performance of the offeror to provide insight into each offeror’s ability to meet our objectives base on actual experience providing similar, related services.  Past performance providing defined retirement benefits services of similar scope (to our needs) will be a major component of past performance.  

	Product or Service Quality:  compliance with contract requirements- technical excellence.
	
	Timeliness of Performance:  meet interim milestones, where applicable – completed on time – reliable- responsive to technical direction, flexible to accelerated reporting requirements in future cycles.
	
	Cost Control:  within budget – current and accurate billing- relation of actual to estimated cost.
	
	Customer Satisfaction: Satisfaction of end users with the vendor’s service. CRIS’ QAG is the primary customer.
	
	
C.	Price Evaluation Factors
We will evaluate your pricing proposal, not only to determine whether the price is reasonable, but also to determine your understanding of the scope of work and your ability to meet the objectives and scope of this RFQ.  The Price Proposal will be evaluated for the base year and all option years. We will evaluate your pricing proposal (for all pricing scenarios) for the base period and all option years to determine completeness (acceptability and validity of the pricing).  To assist in determining reasonableness, evaluation of an offeror's proposal may include verification of the rates proposed.

<DESC>The following are the responses to questions received regarding this solicitation.  The complete amendment can be downloaded at http://www.dsca-gifts.org/)after COB 28 October 2004.  

SECTION SF 30 BLOCK 14 CONTINUATION PAGE 
        
SUMMARY OF CHANGES  

(End of Summary of Changes) 
 
The following items are applicable to this modification:   

SECTION SF 1449 - CONTINUATION SHEET 
        QUESTIONS & RESPONSES
1.  The following questions have been received from industry.  The following are responses from the government.

QUESTION 1:

Is there another URL we need to go to, to get this information?  This one takes me to the SAMM, “How to organize cash flow estimates in a spreadsheet” and “Performing re-estimates with the revised subsidy calculator.”

RESPONSE:

These documents will be posted to the following website by COB October 28, 2004 for industry review.   (http://www.dsca-gifts.org/)  

QUESTION 2:

The solicitation makes numerous references to an existing contractor, which has been supporting DSCA. Can you let us know the name of that contractor and the duration of time for which the company has been supporting DSCA?

RESPONSE:

The incumbent is IBM. The period of the performance is releasable via FOIA.

QUESTION 3:

Volume IV of the solicitation requires a Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 19.704.  As a small business offeror, I am assuming we are not required to provide that plan.

RESPONSE:

See FAR Part 19.702 (2) (b)  “Subcontracting plans (see subparagraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section) are not required- (1) From small Business concerns; (3) For personal service contracts; (4) For modifications to contracts within general scope of the contract that do not contain the clause at 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns (or equivalent prior clauses; e.g. contracts awarded before the enactment of Public Law 95-507)”.

QUESTION 4:

I appreciate the timely response.  Can you please tell me who the incumbent contractor is and whether that firm intends to bid on this work?

RESPONSE:

See question #2.  The government cannot provide guidance or information to potential contractors and if they plan to propose on a solicitation.  

QUESTION 5:

I wanted to touch base with you about the combined solicitation released on today on FBO, number HQ-0013-05-R-0001.  Is there an incumbent contractor, and if so, what is the contract number for that contractor?

RESPONSE:

The incumbent is IBM.  The contract number is GS-23F-9758H.

QUESTION 6:

Although, pages 11 and 66 of the Solicitation reference the type of contract as a firm fixed price contract, page 6, states that it is very possible that the Technical Direction requests will become the predominant work for this project.  Does DSCA expect task 6 to be excluded from the firm fixed price and priced on a time and materials basis given the uncertainty of the tasks that will be assigned?

RESPONSE:

Task 6 will not be excluded from the FFP. It should be priced according to the instructions provided in “Instructions to Offerors”.  

QUESTION 7:

We understand that one of the key tasks in the Solicitation is to review and revise, as appropriate, the current Visual Basic model (deliverable 1c on page 6).  In the absence of information regarding the scope and complexity of the current application, it is difficult to estimate a firm fixed-price bid to review and revise the model.  Can DSCA provide additional information regarding the capabilities of the existing software, (e.g., the numbers of code modules and line counts, whether third-party packages are used, or whether this is a “.NET” application or the older style of compiled Visual Basic, etc.)?

RESPONSE:

No additional information is available other than the information provided in the performance work statement.

QUESTION 8:

Is this a full and open competition?  Are GSA rates acceptable?

RESPONSE:

This acquisition is “unrestricted” and GSA rates are acceptable.

QUESTION 9:

Is a Quality Control Plan required?  Although it is not listed as a deliverable, it is discussed in the evaluation criteria on page 45.

RESPONSE:

In accordance with sub factor c, a quality control plan is required in accordance with the language presented.

QUESTION 10:

Please clarify the deliverable policy outlined on page 12 that discusses the number of days in which the Government will review deliverables and the contractor will incorporate the Government’s revisions.  Are these days “Working” or “Calendar Days”?

RESPONSE:

Paragraph 14.0 is revised to read as follows:    “Upon receipt of the Government comments, the contractor shall have 15 working days to incorporate the Government’s comments and/or change requests and to resubmit the deliverable in its final form.  If written acceptance, the Government within 15 working days of submission of draft does not issue ………………………………….

QUESTION 11:

Page 13 references one base year and 4 option years; however, page 44 references one base year and 3 option years.  Please clarify the anticipated period of performance:

RESPONSE:

Page 44, (2) (1) is revised to read:  “ The Contracting/Pricing Volume consist of the OFFER (The solicitation document as completed and signed to include, as a minimum, the pricing sheet/schedule B, filled in for the base year (one-year) and all option years (4 )(four-one year options)) and all certifications required.  

QUESTION 12:

Will this be awarded under a GSA schedule?

RESPONSE:

See page 47 of 76, Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation—Commercial Items (JAN 1999) (a).

QUESTION 13:

If  not under GSA Schedule, may the contractor propose GSA-equivalent prices, terms and conditions, recognizing that it would not be a transaction under the schedule?

RESPONSE:

In accordance with the language on page 41 of 76, “ (e) Multiple Offers.  Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation.  Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately”.  Any proposal submitted must be responsive to the terms and conditions set out in the solicitation.

QUESTION 14:

If not under a GSA schedule, may the contractor propose GSA-equivalent prices, terms and conditions, recognizing that it would not be a transaction under the schedule?

RESPONSE:

In accordance with the language on page 41 of 76, “ (e) Multiple Offers.  Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation.  Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately”.  Any proposal submitted must be responsive to the terms and conditions set out in the solicitation.


QUESTION 15:

May the contractor submit its most recent corporate-wide, commercial subcontracting plan?

RESPONSE:

See response to question #3.

QUESTION 16:

Please clarify why a DPAS rating is used.

RESPONSE:

Block 13a of the SF 1449 shall remain unchecked.  This is a typographical error.  This solicitation is not subject to a DPAS rating.  

QUESTION 17:

Recognizing that this is FFP, the government is requesting a breakdown of labor categories and hours.  Please clarify if the government also expects to see the hourly labor rates, and the extended dollar amount for each category in the Contracting/Pricing Volume.

RESPONSE:

Yes.

QUESTION 18:

Is box 27a or 27b of the SF 1449 considered checked?

RESPONSE:

The offeror is reminded that clauses FAR 52.212-1, 52.212-4, 52.212-3 and 52.212-5 are ALL included in the solicitation.

QUESTION 19:

Based on page 4 of 76, Section 1.  Introduction, it states, “We are looking for a contractor capable of supporting the current system, working with DSCA to determine current and future requirements, risks, changes and maintaining/upgrading this system.”  What is the current system?

RESPONSE:

The current system is a system that determines current and future requirements, risks, and changes.  In addition, the contractor will be responsible for maintenance and upgrades. 

QUESTION 20:

Based on page 7 of 76, “Task  5 – Maintainance and Updates: The contractor shall offer support to repair of fix software problems.  In addition to maintenance, the contractor shall prepare a report identifying the level of support necessary to maintain and update software problems.  Will DSCA provide information to contractors on its current system that will establish a basis for pricing Task 5?

RESPONSE:

The government has provided all the available information to price task 5 as stated in the solicitation, PWS.


QUESTION 21:

Based on page 7 of 76, “Task 6 – Technical Direction (TD).  A. In the event that DSCA must consider moving to a new software application the contractor will be required to work with the DSCA POC to define the requirements to transition from the current software to a new to be determined software based application.  If this change should become necessary DSCA would expect the contractor to support all phases of this transition.”  Will DSCA provide information to contractors on its current system that will establish a basis for pricing Task 6.

RESPONSE:

All information in regards to Task 6 is already stated in the PWS. This is a FFP RFP.

QUESTION 22:

On page 4 of 76 in Section 1, Introduction, the solicitation states, “Currently the Credit Reform Project is supported by a GSA contract awarded several year ago.”  Based on the above, does DSCA expect pricing to be in accordance with a specific GSA contract schedule?

RESPONSE:

No.  This is a FFP RFP.

QUESTION 23:

RESPONSE:

QUESTION 30:

Based on the lack of specific information provided in the solicitation , KPMG requests that DSCA extend the due date of the final proposal by two weeks to give all bidders an opportunity to properly consider an appropriate service plan?

RESPONSE:

Presently, the government is not entertaining any extensions.  All proposals are due by 2 November 2004 at 9:00 A.M. EST.  A sources sought notice was posted on 12 Oct 2004 and the offeror that presented this question responded on the 18th of October.

<DESC>This amendment is issued to provide all offerors with the questions submitted by offerors, and the answers to those questions:
Question 1.  JFMIP requirements envision retaining information about collateral condition/value data. Since collateral data is resident in REMS, will the new loan accounting system also require the data be maintained internal to it? As another example, would program-related correspondence to borrowers about debt repayment be retained by the new loan accounting system as well?

Answer:  No,  the OCFO loan accounting system will not maintain collateral data.  No,  the OCFO loan accounting system will not maintain debt repayment information.  That requirement will stay with Housing.

Question 2. JFMIP requirements indicate the system should be capable of automatically capitalizing interest in accordance with established policies. While the loan accounting system must be able to establish a modifed mortgage, including capitalizing delinquent interest, for example, does this feature need to be automatic or automatically generate a new amortization schedule based on the recast mortgage?

Answer:  The functional requirements document currently calls for the generation of a new amortization schedule.  However, if the proposed COTS package includes an automatic feature to handle recast mortgages that meets the requirements, it will be considered.

Question 3. Is the Claims Collection Litigation Report used for the Section 202 program?

Answer:  This is not a requirement for the OCFO loan accounting system.

Question 4. HUD indicates that it wishes to have scanned memos and other documents available in the system. What kind of scanning technology and infrastructure does HUD envision?

Answer:  HUD expects the proposed COTS technology to include scanning technology that is compatible with HUD's hardware/software infrastructure.

Question 5. In several places, the PWS states that the COTS must be web-based.  Does web-based imply a browser user interface, or does it mean that the application must operate using the internet rather than a dedicated communication line[s]? 

Answer:  Web-based is intended to mean a browser user interface via the internet and Intranet

Question 6.  On pages 12 and 14 of the PWS, the document refers to "Testing of the COTS software in MS 2000 or successor operating systems on the server and client". Is operating on MS2000 a requirement?

Answer: Microsoft Windows 2000 Operating System is the HUD standard.

Question 7.  The System Security and Privacy Plan, page 2.1, discusses the availability requirements for the LAS system. The document states: "The intended up time for web access is expected to be 24 hours since there is no direct access to the LAS database." Does this mean that the web system is a separate system? Does the web-based system access the LAS database as its data source, or is it a separate system that contains data extracted from the LAS system?

Answer:   The web-based front-end system is the new LAS system; there is no separate system or database after implementation of the new LAS system.  There should be a real time interface for web access to the LAS database. 

Question 8. In the PWS on page 2, the document states "successful completion of all scenarios required" during Product demonstration. Where are the scenarios documented?

Answer:  Product demonstration scenarios were provided in Amendment 3 of the solicitation

Question 9. Does HUD expect to acquire source code for the vendor's product?  Should the price bid for CLIN001A reflect the cost for source code to the commercial product? 

Answer: HUD expects to purchase a COTS package.  If the vendor develops source code to customize the COTS, HUD expects to own the customized source code.

Question 10. In the PWS section 9.1.5.G, use of CA Endeavor and PVCS are required. Allfusion Endeavor is a mainframe software  configuration management tool. Why does HUD specify software configuration management tools when purchasing a COTS? COTS licenses do not include source code, and any modifications to the licensed product would be made by the vendor. Please explain.

Answer:  Interface logic to Hitachi and Unisys based systems must still use either CA Endeavor or PVCS.

Question 11. Standard COTS software purchases include an initial license fee followed by yearly maintenance and support fees. The Solicitation Description in the PWS does not include an annual software license fee line item for the first, second, third and fourth option period. In addition, Tasks 1, 9, and 10 of the PWS, which are the tasks that apply in those option periods, make no mention of software license and maintenance fees to the vendor. Task 2 specifies annual licenses, and the Schedule of Contractor Deliverables specifies licenses must be provided annually. Please comment. 

Answer:  The vendor is responsible for purchasing all required license and software fees.  These fees should be built in to the price for the base period and option years.  Separate line items will not be provided for the license and software fees.

Question 12. Page 11, Task 2, states the following requirement: "Includes technical training for three HUD developers and five HUD super-users." Why is training for HUD developers required if the vendor is responsible for maintenance?

Answer:  The developer training noted in the SOW is required to enable HUD staff to have a better understanding of the software and it's capabilities.  HUD staff receiving the developer training would not undertake a true developer role.

Question 13. There are several COTS loan servicing solutions offered as an ASP model, some of which are compliant with FFMIA JFMIP, USSGL, etc. If a vendor were willing to offer a solution that fulfilled the LASHE functional requirements and offered a cost-effective alternative to customized COTS, would this solution be considered?

Answer:  No.  At this time HUD OCFO is pursuing purchase of a COTS system to support loan servicing.

Question 14. Implementing the functionality required in the extensive Functional Requirements Document plus developing the required interfaces will likely constitute more than minimal modifications to a COTS product. After these enhancements are made, it is quite likely that future vendor releases and patches will not be compatible with the HUD product. How will HUD address the cost and product knowledge required to maintain its product, which will no longer be COTS? 

Answer:  HUD expects to purchase a COTS package that has already been implemented at another federal agency.  In addition, we are ready to tailor our business processes as needed to accommodate better loan servicing while still maintaining our business regulations.   HUD expects minimum to no customization and does not expect this to be an issue.  

Question 15. Does HUD still have a requirement that the LAS software be compatible with Windows 95?

Answer:  No. Windows XP is currently the HUD standard.

Question 16.  In order to address all requirements, particularly the Special Standards for COTS software highlighted in Amendment #1, which specifies that, "HUD must have the ability to work directly with the person or entity that has the legal authority to repair, alter, etc. the software without the involvement of a third party", we plan to proposes a GSA Team Arrangement (http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?faq=yes&pageTypeId=8199&contentId=8124&contentType=GSA_OVERVIEW). Please clarify whether HUD has any objections to GSA Teaming Arrangements for this solicitation. 

Answer:  HUD is still researching the answer to this question.  The answer will be provided in an upcoming amendment.

As a result of this amendment, the date set for receipt of proposals is hereby extended to noon on Friday, November 5, 2004.
