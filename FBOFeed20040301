<DESC>The applicable NAICS Code is 611430, $6million. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), National Highway Institute (NHI) plans to award a 5-year nationwide contract to provide course delivery for their 3.5 – day Course #420018 – Instructor Development Course. The delivery may also include an optional two-hour Web conference that may be held before and/or after the course. A Master Trainer will be required in addition to the instructor to evaluate if the participants qualify as candidates for certification at the end of the course. A minimum of two (2) individuals will be required to undergo NHI’s process for becoming a Master Trainer.

The Instructor Development Course (IDC) prepares FHWA instructors and NHI contract instructors who are currently teaching or scheduled to teach NHI courses for NHI instructor certification. The class is designed to broaden and enhance the knowledge, skills and abilities required to conduct training courses. This is not a presentation skills class but a class that teaches the participant Adult Learning Principals. These principles will improve the participant's ability to meet the needs of the adult learner.

The NHI Instructor Certification Program provides a method to assess continuous skill improvement of instructors. The NHI’s approach to certification is built on a set of instructor competencies selected from a validated competency list of the American Society of Training and Development. NHI instructor certification is reserved for FHWA and NHI contract instructors who will be involved in the delivery of NHI courses within the next 12 months. 

Three and one half days in length, the IDC has the student conduct training that is critiqued by fellow student and the instructor. Following approximately 1.5 days of instruction, the student conducts a final training that is critiqued by fellow participants, the instructor, and a Master Trainer. 

The contractor will be required to revise the course to effect any required minor changes to the course materials over the life of the contract, and to deliver a minimum of 6 sessions of the course per year.

The contractor must have professional instructional systems design experience, and the technical competence to develop meaningful and effective instructor led and distance learning training course materials. The academic credentials, professional experience, and technical competence to develop appropriate high quality course materials and to deliver meaningful, successful training using adult learning principles are key evaluation factors.

The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site at http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DOT/FHWA/postdate_1.html which will list all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date.

<DESC>The National Center of Education Evaluation and Regional Technical Assistance (NCEE), in the Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences, intends to award a contract to conduct a congressionally-mandated, impact evaluation of the DC Choice Program recently enacted in law as Title III of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act of 2004, Division C of HR 2673.  The program provides scholarships of up to $7,500 to enable approximately 2,000 low-income elementary and secondary students to attend private schools in addition to the public schools already available to them.  The evaluation will conform to Section 309 of the law, and be based largely on a comparison of academic assessments and other outcomes of students randomly assigned by a lottery to either receive a scholarship or not receive a scholarship.  The contractor will administer the assessments, collect other school records, conduct student, parent, and principal surveys, and carry out case studies.  The contractor will use the most rigorous methods to analyze these data and prepare reports to Congress by December 1 of each year of the program.  These activities are expected to provide the Department and Congress with a high quality, objective, and independent examination of the effectiveness of the DC Choice Program.  The award will be a cost plus fixed fee, with performance-based incentives, contract.  Anticipated issue date:  March 17, 2004, with closing date of April 16, 2004.

The BOA will cover a three-year period with two one-year options and include line items for engineering/logistics support, spares procurement, depot repair to include re-assembly, upgrade/modification of assemblies and/or subassemblies in support of the Tactical Common Data Link-Navy System.  Procurements under the BOA will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>This solicitation is a design build construction project to renovate two large, historically significant structures connected to the former Del Monte Hotel (now known as Herrmann Hall) at the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey California.  The Navy has determined that Herrmann Hall and its wing buildings are properties eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.  The two five story, wood-framed structures, comprising approximately 135,000 square feet, were built in 1888 and require upgrading to meet current seismic, antiterrorism, and quality of life standards.  The buildings sit on brick foundations that have had no reinforcement added since constructed.  Most windows are considered historically significant and must remain in place including the glazing.  These structures are currently used for BOQ and administrative purposes.  While the entire two structures require structural upgrading, only a portion of the two buildings (105,000 square feet) will be finished to provide accommodations for 140 parties.  All building systems require renovation.  The buildings will be vacant during the renovation period.  The Government will provide preservation goals to the proposers.  Site improvements and renovation of site utilities are required.  Considerable renovation work has taken place over the life of the structures.  It is the intent that the exterior stucco finish added in 1926 will remain.  Restoration of the exterior to the original wood construction is not desired.  Preservation efforts will be focused on public areas.  Quarters will approach the standards outlined in UFC-4-721-10.  The Contractor will be required to provide interior design services and may be required to assist in the purchasing and installation of furnishings.  Renovation will comply with The Secretary of the Interior's Standards  for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings to the maximum extent feasible.  The contract completion time is 870 calendar days.  The target cost for this procurement is approximately $30,000,000.  This procurement is unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236220 with a related small business size standard of $28,500,000.  The government will evaluate proposals using two-phase source selection procedures.  During Phase 1 proposals will be evaluated on the following three Factors:  (1) Past Performance; (2) Technical Qualifications; and (3) Small Business Subcontracting Effort.  The three highest qualified proposers will be issued Phase II of the solicitation by amendment that will include Phase 2 evaluation factors.  A Pre Proposal Conference will be held on 23 March 2004 at 10:00 am to 12:30 pm at the Naval Post Graduate School Monterey, California.  Contact Ms. Kim Cantrell at (831) 656-3602 to make arrangements for entering the base.  Phase 1 of the solicitation will be available on or about 16 March 2004.  Proposals for Phase 1 will be due 15 April 2004.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL ISSUE PHASE 1 OF THIS SOLICITATION THROUGH THE INTERNET.  The solicitation will NOT be provided in a paper hard copy format or CD.  Notification of any changes to this solicitation will be made ONLY on the Internet site.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Fluke Corporation for the acquisition of :
(1)	Reference Standard, P/N 732B (Qty. 3), 
(2)	Resistance Standard, P/N 742A-1 (Qty. 3), 
(3)	Resistance Standard, P/N 742A-10K (Qty. 4).
The primary use will be for Fleet Intermediate workload support.  The 732B is a precision reference and transfer standard of 10 volts and 1.018 volts used to verify voltage measurements of higher accuracy multi-meters and multi-function calibrators.  Accuracy for the 732B reference/transfer standard is 3ppm per year. The 742A-1 is a precision accuracy 1 ohm reference resistor with accuracy of 8ppm per year.  The 742A-10K is a 10,000 ohm reference resistor accurate to 4ppm per year.

The Government intends to procure the above items under the authority of USC 2304(c) (1), FAR 6.302-1 and under GSA Schedule GS-24F-1029B. A non-competitive procurement is being requested due to the required logistics costs the Navy would incur to verify/certify a new model number(s) and incorporate the new model number(s) into NAVAIR METCAL instrument calibration procedures. The above listed model numbers have been verified/certified for accuracy, drift, temperature correlation, voltage and power. 

Logistics support costs shall be considered in the overall cost to the Navy when introducing new model numbers. This is of particularly concern when the quantities of new items are low and the overall cost to the Navy would far exceed the actual cost of the unit.  Furthermore, delays in fielding equipment would be incurred as the new calibration procedure workload and/or training is introduced into the system.  

The Government does not own current data, drawings, or other specifications to permit full and open competition.  Same model numbers are desired and encouraged for this procurement.  Any required government logistics costs to support a new model number will be considered as part of the total cost of this procurement.  Any responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal in writing that may be used by the Government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely with in the discretion of the Government.  Responses must be received within 15 days of publication of this notice. The Point of Contact is Kathryn Murtagh (732) 323-4643.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management requires a topographical model of the Red Rocks National Conservation Area (RRNCA) with a laser based projection system for illuminating and illustrating stories about the RRNCA at the RRNCA Visitor Center.  The BLM intends to negotiate with the only known source, InterVison Media, 261 E. 12th Avenue, Eugene, OR, 97401-3208 per the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  InterVision is the only known source with the technology, skills, qualifications, and organizational partnerships required to produce a 3-D, interactive, laser projected terrain model of this type for the RRNCA.  InterVision has the combination of skills and experience to develop stories for multimedia presentation, including audio, video, interactive CD-ROM, and laser projection.  InterVision's team includes a producer, graphic designer, programmer, cartographer, and laser technician who work together to develop the model, map illustration, story script, and lighting effects to meet the RRNCA's needs.  The estimated cost for this acquisition is $120,000.00.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  No Request for Proposal  (RFP) will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities.  This notice serves to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  This requirement is 100% set aside for small business under NAICS code 712190, "Nature Parks and Other Similar Institutions," with a size standard of $6.0 Million.  Responsible firms believing they can provide an interactive laser guided map of equal or superior quality are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing this announcement number NAR040054. However any firm identifying themselves as responsible must provide evidence that they can furnish the requested system at the required location, and at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated contract cost.  All responses will be fully considered.  If no responses are received by April 15, 2004 to the effect that another responsible source exists, award will be made to InterVision for the requirements stated herein.  Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed to Elaine E. Flick at (303) 236-3528, or emailed to elaine_flick@blm.gov.  See Note 22!

These companies were awarded contracts for Phase 1 (Formulation) under the progressive competition procedures described in NASA FAR Supplement 1817.7300(c) and 1817.7301-5.  On or about March 15, these Phase 1 contractors will be provided preliminary documents for comment and will be provided an opportunity to "dry run" the oral presentation that is a requirement of the Phase 2 competition, prior to release of the final instructions.. While NASA's expectation is that only these Phase 1 contractors will be able to successfully compete for Phase 2, all proposals will be considered.  However, a proposal from any such additional offeror(s) must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the Phase 1 contractors.	This demonstration must include Completion of a Preliminary Design and the results of completed trade studies and analysis (fully compliant with Phase 1 Contract Statement of Work).	Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render a proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.  All of these conditions were disclosed during the full and open competition for Phase 1.  Any responsible source may indicate its desire to submit a proposal for the implementation phase and request the opportunity to "dry run" the oral presentation.  Preliminary documents and the final instructions to the Phase 1 contractors, when available, will be provided to potential additional offerors upon request.  Requests for the preliminary documents or for the final instructions to the Phase 2 contractors must be directed to Clelia Walker, Code 210.7, NASA/GSFC, Greenbelt, MD 20771.

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) requires a contractor for comprehensive development of a new system and/or management of the system currently maintained and operated as the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) System.  FBO serves as the single Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE) for federal agencies and contractors for federal procurement opportunities.  The acquisition will be a 100% small business set aside, and the contract will be “performance based”.  

FBO is mandated by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 5), and supports a key Federal E-Government objective on improving access to open market contracting opportunities through technology.    Through one portal, commercial vendors seeking Federal markets for their products and services can search, monitor and retrieve opportunities from the entire Federal contracting community.    Government buyers are able to publicize their business opportunities by posting information directly to FedBizOpps.  FedBizOpps can be found at www.fedbizopps.gov or www.fbo.gov       

The Government will release a Request for Proposal (RFP) using a Statement of Objectives (SOO), which will allow all offerors the flexibility to develop cost-effective solutions and have the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives meeting the stated objectives in the SOO.    The SOO shall be used by the offerors to develop their proposed Performance Work Statement, their Contractor Master Plan which includes their technical approach, performance standards, and a quality assurance surveillance plan, based upon commercial business practices, and any other documents required by the RFP.    

The RFP is expected to be released on or about 3/26/04.  Requests for the solicitation may be mailed to the GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, ROBERT ABOOD, 10304 Eaton Place, Fairfax, VA 22030, OR sent via e-mail to robert.abood@gsa.gov.  

To view current documentation pertaining to this acquisition see FBO Solicitation Number "Reference-Number-022504" for instructions.  Attached to that synopsis is a link to the current version of the Statement of Objectives (SOO) and related documents.    These documents are located within FedTeDS.    For FedTeDS registration information go to    www.fedteds.gov and click on the ”Registering with FedTeDS” link and follow the instructions.    Response to your registration request requires 48 hours.  Note:  The current FBO SOO and related documents are located in FedTeDS, however interested vendors who have registered with FedTeDS must link to FedTeDS through the FBO synopsis number “Reference-Number-022504”.    

NOTE:  Documents in FedTeDS are current as of 2/25/04.  These documents currently in FedTeDS may be revised, updated or deleted, and additional documents may be added.  The next FedTeDS documentation update will coincide with the release of the solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-Picatinny located at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ will have a requirement for the production of caliber .50 M858 Ball and M860 Trace Plastic training cartridges.  These cartridges are intended for use in training  areas where range restrictions preclude the use of full range standard service  ammunition.  They should provide the ability to increase the frequency of  training and hence the proficiency of the user by affording training areas  previously closed by range restrictions. The cartridges will be designed to be  used in the caliber .50 M2 Machine Gun with a M3 Recoil Adapter. The maximum  safety is 700 meters and the effective training range is 150 meters. The Tracer  cartridge will exhibit a visible trace up to 150 meters. An initial quantity of approximately 1,010,000 rounds (4 balls/1 tracer) will be required from the  Contractor for the first (1) period of performance with approximately 1,000,000 rounds over the course of the next two options periods to be exercised later.  Delivery is expected 240 calendar days after contract award. Any source  interested in competing for the award of a production contract must first  become a qualified source.  In order to be eligible for award, a design must be  qualified prior to contract award (see FAR 9.206-1(c)). In order to be qualified, each design must undergo an extensive battery of tests as specified  in the Government Performance Specification for the M858. Any Contractor  interested in qualifying their design shall be fully responsible for all  coordination and costs associated with the qualification test. Upon request,  any interested contractor will be supplied with the procedures necessary to  qualify a new design. The procurement will be a full and open competition, and  any responses received will be evaluated for Best Value utilizing the trade-off method for selection, resulting in single or multiple contractor awards. All  information is to be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  POC: Carmen Lindstrom, Business/Manufacturing Specialist or Lori A.

The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asia is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with country offices in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  It is responsible for the development and management of the U.S. Government’s program of assistance that is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources; and improved primary healthcare.  USAID/Almaty manages all USAID assistance for the five Central Asian Republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan.  Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.  With a total population of 55 million, and dozens of ethnic groups, the five new nations of the region are emerging from 150 years of Russian domination.  A recent civil war, threats of religious extremism, ethnic rivalries, authoritarian governments, and lack of viable institutions make Central Asia a particularly difficult challenge for USAID.

Democracy and Conflict Mitigation (DM) is one of four technical offices in the Mission, and the DM Office Director reports directly to the Mission Director.  Democracy and Conflict Mitigation is responsible for achieving results in the following Mission Strategic Objectives in Central Asia: Strengthened Democratic Culture Among Citizens and Target Institutions, and Sources of Conflict Mitigated in Target Communities.

<DESC>REAL-TIME ADVERSARIAL INTELLIGENCE AND DECISION-MAKING (RAID), SOL BAA 04-16, DUE:  04/21/04; POC: Dr. Alexander Kott, DARPA/IXO; FAX: (703) 465-1065.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Information Exploitation Office (IXO) is soliciting proposals for the Real-time Adversarial Intelligence and Decision-making program under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). BACKGROUND:  The Real-time Adversarial Intelligence and Decision-making (RAID) program focuses on the challenge of anticipating enemy actions in a military operation. In a number of recent publications, US military leaders call for the development of techniques and tools to address this critical challenge. In the US Air Force community, the term, predictive battlespace awareness, refers to capabilities that would help the commander and staff to characterize and predict likely enemy courses of action, to relate the history of the enemy’s performance to its current and future actions, and to associate these predictions with opportunities for friendly actions and effects.  A related term, predictive analysis, is being used in the US Army community to denote a process and tools for predicting future enemy actions.  Today’s practices of military intelligence and decision-making do include a number of processes specifically aimed at predicting enemy actions.  Currently, these processes are largely manual as well as mental, and do not involve any significant use of technical means.  Even when computerized wargaming is used (albeit rarely in field conditions), it relies either on human guidance of the simulated enemy units or on simple reactive behaviors of such simulated units; in neither case is there a computerized prediction of intelligent and forward-looking enemy actions. Thus, the challenge of predicting enemy actions involves the development of computational means to reason about the future enemy actions in a way that combines: the enemy’s intelligent plans to achieve his objectives by effective use of his strengths and opportunities; the enemy’s perception of friendly strengths, weaknesses and intents; the enemy’s tactics, doctrine, training, moral, cultural and other biases and preferences;  the impact of terrain, environment (including non-combatant population), weather, time and space available; the influence of personnel attrition, ammunition and other consumable supplies, logistics, communications, sensors and other elements of a military operation; and the complex interplay and mutual dependency of friendly and enemy actions, reactions and counteractions that unfold during the execution of the operation. In this program, we use the term adversarial reasoning to refer to the process of making inferences over the totality of the above factors.  We also use the term deception reasoning to refer to another important aspect of predicting enemy actions: the fact that military operations are historically, crucially dependent on the ability to use various forms of concealment and deception for friendly purposes while detecting and counteracting the enemy’s concealment and deception. Therefore, adversarial reasoning must include deception reasoning.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVE:  The RAID Program will develop a real-time adversarial predictive analysis tool that operates as an automated enemy predictor providing a continuously updated picture of probable enemy actions in tactical ground operations.  The RAID Program will strive to:  prove that adversarial reasoning can be automated; prove that automated adversarial reasoning can include deception; prove that automated adversarial reasoning can account for doctrinal and cultural biases; and integrate these predictive analysis tools into a warfighter’s C2 and intelligence support system.  PROGRAM STRUCTURE:  This solicitation requests efforts in four related areas. Adversarial Reasoning: design and build the Adversarial Reasoning Module and internal models; continue to develop and enhance this component as the program progresses through its phases; support the program’s series of increasingly realistic experiments; share the content of the internal models with the Deception Reasoning Module via the interfaces constructed by the System Integrator; perform the efforts in close coordination with the System Integrator and according to the system specifications developed by the System Integrator.; and provide the Adversarial Reasoning Module software to the other Adversarial Reasoning Module performer for the purposes of acting as an automated red commander for in-house experiments. It is expected that there will be up to two (2) awards in this area. However, in the event of two awards for this area, only one will be carried to Phase III.  Deception Reasoning:  design and build the Deception Reasoning Module; continue to develop and enhance this component as the program progresses through its phases; support the program’s series of increasingly realistic experiments; utilize the content of the internal models via the interfaces constructed by the System Integrator; and perform the efforts in close coordination with the System Integrator and according to the system specifications developed by the System Integrator. It is expected that there will be up to two (2) awards in this area. In the event of two awards for this area, only one will be carried to Phase III.  System Integration: design and build the overall architecture, interfaces, representations and formats of the RAID system, components and testbed; enable sharing of data and models between the Adversarial Reasoning Module and Deception Reasoning Module; modify, as necessary, the interfaces and entity behaviors of a combat simulation system; replace notional parameters and models with validated and realistic ones in connection with system-wide experiments; implement elements of the experimental scenario and terrain as designed by the Experimentation and evaluation performer; provide hardware, software (a combat simulation system) and facilities for experiments; design and build interfaces required for integration of the RAID capability into the target transition environment; and act as if the prime contractor and manage the efforts of the Adversarial Reasoning and the Deception Reasoning area performers.  It is expected that there will be only one (1) award in this area.   Experimentation and evaluation: design experiments, design wargame scenarios, define system- and component-level metrics, design instrumentation to obtain data, provide and train human players, manage and execute experiments, collect and analyze data; provide subject matter expertise to the RAID technology developers; liaison with potential users of RAID and transition partners; and maintain organizational and contractual independence from performers in other areas of the program in order to provide objective experimental evaluation of RAID performance but coordinate closely with the System Integrator.  It is expected that there will be only one (1) award in this area.  Teaming is encouraged.  An organization can propose to more than one area, with a separate proposal for each area.  However, no individual should be named in more than one proposal.   PROGRAM PHASES:  The RAID program will be conducted in three 12-month phases.  Phase I – Anticipation:  develop mechanisms to compute adversarial, anticipative, move-countermove actions.  Phase II – Detection:  develop the ability to see through the fog of war and recognize deceptions.  Phase III - Transition:  develop fieldable products which can integrate with existing C2 and ISR systems.  The development of RAID will be driven by a rigorous program of increasingly difficult and realistic experiments. Each phase of the program will include two series of experiments. Outcomes of the experiments will have a decisive influence on continuing funding of the program or its individual efforts. For planning purposes, assume the following schedule of experiments: Phase I – 8 and 11 months after contract; Phase II – 18 and 23 months after contract, Phase II – 30 and 35 months after contract. To assess RAID progress at the end of each phase DARPA will use quantitative metrics and experimental conditions as discussed in the Proposer Information Package (PIP).  In addition to these program-wide experiments, RAID contractors will design and perform in-house experiments to assess the progress made toward the program goals in development of the contractor’s respective component.  RAID contractors will propose specific component-level assessment metrics to be used in such component-specific experiments.  AWARDS:  Up to two (2) awards are anticipated in each of the two technical areas: Adversarial Reasoning and Deception Reasoning.  Up to one (1) award is contemplated in the areas of:  system integration and experimentation and evaluation.  Non-critical path tasks that can be cleanly separated as individual modules should be proposed and costed as options.  The contract will be incrementally funded by fiscal year, assuming identified milestones have been satisfactorily met.  Funding in the out years is subject to satisfactory evaluation of the DARPA Go/No go criteria as well as availability of funds.  Contract Mechanisms:  Awards are anticipated to be in the form of Procurement Contracts or Other Transactions.  Grants or Cooperative Agreements are also possible.  SELECTION CRITERIA:  Proposals will be selected through a technical/scientific/business decision process with technical and scientific considerations being most important.  Evaluations will be performed using the following criteria listed in descending order of relative importance:  (1) Technical Depth and Feasibility, (2) Consistency with RAID Program Concepts, (3) Cost Realism and Value of Proposed Work to the Government, and (4) Personnel and Corporate Capabilities and Experience. Further details may be found in the PIP which can be accessed at http://www.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations/raid/index.htm.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype hardware and/or software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on a specific system or solution.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Proposals may involve other research groups or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.  This BAA shall remain open and proposals received up to one year following this BAA’s release.

<SUBJECT>J--Well Drilling Support Truck
<SOLNBR>MARKETSURVEY02
<RESPDATE>041404
<ARCHDATE>06132004
<CONTACT>Tera Sinclair, 586-574-8901
<DESC>Introduction:  The Army has a requirement for 3 LP-12 Well Drilling Systems.  Each LP-12 Well Drilling System consists of a 'Well Drilling Rig, 600 Ft. Rotary' (NSN 3820-01-178-5057) and a Well Drilling Support Truck by the Navy under Army contract D  AAK01-86-D-C073.  These Well Drilling Rigs were originally procured Support Trucks.  Our plan is to modify 3 other Army standard trucks to meet the requirement for Support Trucks.  The 3 trucks will be provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) by t h e Army.  Although the Army has not conclusively decided what trucks will be used, it is likely tht they will be Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Trucks (HEMTT).  The contractor's response to this market survey should be based upon the M977 or M985 HEMTT Ca rgo Truck (the cargo bed and crane will not be utilized).  The contractor's effort would be to procure/manufacture and install the required equipment to convert the HEMMTT into a Support Truck.  The contractor would also furnish all assemblies and parts  to  be used in this effort.  The only Government Furnished Equipment will be the trucks to be used for the conversion to the Support Truck.  All assemblies/parts to be added to the truck will be provided by the contractor.  Contractors should provide the foll owing information:  1.  What is the estimated cost to modify the support trucks?  This should be just a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate and will be used for budgeting purposes only.  2.  What is the estimated time required for the contractor t o com plete the modifications, starting with the contract award date.  This should include lead time needed for the contractor to procure all required assemblies/parts.  How long after contract award should the trucks be delivered to the contractor?  3.  W here i s the facility that would perform the modification work?  4.  What type of warranty would the contractor be willing to provide?  5.  Does the contractor have the capability of preparing an appendix to Army technical manuals TM 5-3820-256-10 and TM 3 820-256 -24? (These TMs are for the LP-12 system and cover, respectively, operation and maintenance of the well drilling system).  The appendix would cover only the modifications added to the truck.

<DESC>Introduction:  The Army has a requirement for 3 LP-12 Well Drilling Systems.  Each LP-12 Well Drilling System consists of a 'Well Drilling Rig, 600 Ft. Rotary' (NSN 3820-01-178-5057) and a Well Drilling Support Truck by the Navy under Army contract D AAK01-86-D-C073.  These Well Drilling Rigs were originally procured Support Trucks.  Our plan is to modify 3 other Army standard trucks to meet the requirement for Support Trucks.  The 3 trucks will be provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) by th e Army.  Although the Army has not conclusively decided what trucks will be used, it is likely tht they will be Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Trucks (HEMTT).  The contractor's response to this market survey should be based upon the M977 or M985 HEMTT Ca rgo Truck (the cargo bed and crane will not be utilized).  The contractor's effort would be to procure/manufacture and install the required equipment to convert the HEMMTT into a Support Truck.  The contractor would also furnish all assemblies and parts to  be used in this effort.  The only Government Furnished Equipment will be the trucks to be used for the conversion to the Support Truck.  All assemblies/parts to be added to the truck will be provided by the contractor.  Contractors should provide the foll owing information:  1.  What is the estimated cost to modify the support trucks?  This should be just a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate and will be used for budgeting purposes only.  2.  What is the estimated time required for the contractor to com plete the modifications, starting with the contract award date.  This should include lead time needed for the contractor to procure all required assemblies/parts.  How long after contract award should the trucks be delivered to the contractor?  3.  Where i s the facility that would perform the modification work?  4.  What type of warranty would the contractor be willing to provide?  5.  Does the contractor have the capability of preparing an appendix to Army technical manuals TM 5-3820-256-10 and TM 3820-256 -24? (These TMs are for the LP-12 system and cover, respectively, operation and maintenance of the well drilling system).  The appendix would cover only the modifications added to the truck.  If the contractor has this capability, please include a separate  ROM and estimate of time required to prepare the appendix.  6.  Does the contractor have the capability of training Army or other contractor personnel in the operation and maintenace of the modifications added to the truck?  (The idea here is to train bet ween 2 and 5 people who would then train the soldiers in the units that will receive the equipment).  If the contractor has this capability, please include a separate ROM and estimate of time required for one such class.  7.  Does the contractor have the c apability of provisioning (i.e. identifying parts so the Army can assign stock numbers) for assemblies/parts added to the truck.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposal.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests. The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, San Diego, Seal Beach Detachment is searching for sources that can meet the specifications outlined below.  All contractors that can meet the specifications are required to provide a capability statement, company literature, brochures, or any other information that demonstrates/illustrates the specification can be met. All responses are required 14 days after the posting date of this announcement. The sic code fo r this requirement is 3861.  Contractor must specify size standard.   (     )Small Business Concern  (     ) Large Business Concern Any questions concerning this requirement, and the submittal of documentation shall be directed to:  Cuc.Tran@navy.mil - phone number 562-626-7139.  Fax number is 562-626-7877 The following are the specifications for the Camera Mounts 1.     GENERAL This specification sets forth the requirements for camera mount for the Weapons Impact Scoring Set (WISS).  WISS is an electro-optical bomb scoring system which uses video cameras, precisely pointed at a target area, to score the practice bombs of Navy aircraft. The camera mount will be used to precisely aim, or orient WISS cameras upon the target areas(s).  The WISS camera shall mount on top of the camera mount that shall in turn be mounted to various supporting structures. Ad ditionally, the camera mount shall be mounted within certain environmental enclosures used with WISS when the cameras are mounted outdoors.  This variation of hardware to which the camera mount attaches drives the size maximums set forth below. 2.0     APPLICABLE STANDARDS 2.1     The camera mount must strictly conform to the following standard: 2.1.1  Federal Standard 595B -- Color used in Government Procurement. 3.0      REQUIREMENTS 3.1      OVERVIEW The camera mount shall provide three axes rotational adjustment of azimuth, elevation and horizon.  Azimuth is the horizontal adjustment, and elevation is the vertical adjustment of the camera. Horizon is defined as rotation about the long axis of the camera, otherwise known the cameras’ optical axis.  Horizon adjustment, therefore effects the “leveling” adjustment on the horizon of image obtained by video c amera. 3.2      MECHANICAL CHARACTERISTICS 3.2.1   The camera mount shall have a capability of adjusting each axis independently -- One axis can be adjusted without any effect to the other two axes.  Each axis shall have reference tick marks that will let the operator know the angle and the direction of the cameras.  The resolution of the tick markers shall be +/- degree. 3.2.1.1    The azimuth shall have a minimum adjustment of +/- 10 degrees. 3.2.1.2    The elevation shall have a minimum adjustment of +/- 15 degrees. 3.2.1.3    The horizon shall have a minimum adjustment of +/- 3 degrees. 3.2.2       The angular adjustment, mentioned above, shall be accomplished entirely by hand manipulation, without resorting to tools.  The adjustability movement shall meet the fineness adjustment mentioned below. 3.2.2.1    The minimum angular adjustment, also known as  the fineness adjustment, of all three axes shall enable repeatable movements as small as angles defined by tangents of one part in two thousand (1/2000), which is approximately equivalent to 0.025 degrees. 3.2.2.2    The “Repeatable movements” mentioned above is defined as movement that can be made repetitively by a camera mount operator, exercising the utmost care in applying the minimum forces required to effect the minimum possible movement of the adjusting surfaces (knobs, levels, etc.) -- during hand adjustment operations. 3.2.3   The adjusting knobs (and/or other controlling devices) shall be accessed from the back third of the camera mount (the back of the camera mount correlates with the back of a camera positioned upon it). 3.2.3.1    If knobs are being  used as controlling devices, the knobs shall have a uniform thickness not less than 0.25 inch, and not more  the 0.375 inch.  The adjusting knobs shall not exceed more than four (4). 3.2.4  The mechanics of the camera mount shall be constructed sufficiently “tight”.  The “play” shall be minimized to permit adjustment to the above stated fineness, without movement in excess of that fineness criteria prior to final lock down.  There shall be no looseness allowed within the structures of the camera mount when it’s locked. 3.2.5   The lock down mechanism shall be provided for these two reasons:  First, to preserve the final desired aimed position.  Second, to inhibit blunder adjustments by requiring a subsequent camera mount adjustor to consciously remove adjustment lock down prior to readjustment. 3.2.5.1   The camera mount shall have independent locking mechanism for each axis.  This locking mechanism shall disable the adjustment of particular axis by any means -- unwanted adj ustment, vibrations, etc. 3.2.5.2   The locking mechanism shall be accomplished by a simple tool (Allen wrenches, etc.).  The tool shall be attached within the camera mount and be readily available. 3.2.5.3   When the camera mount is locked, the lock down mechanism shall maintain the final adjustment of all three axes when exposed to shocks and vibrations normally expected within a WISS tower. 3.3   PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTIC 3.3.1 The camera mount, in order to accommodate the limited spaces upon the WISS camera racks and the environmental enclosures, shall not exceed an overall dimension of 7 inches longs by 4.25 inches wide by 3.0 inches high (7.00”L X 4.25”W x 3.00”H). 3.3.2  The camera mount shall have a removable camera mounting plate that affixes to the under side of the WISS cameras with countersunk bolts.  This plate shall have maximum dimensions of 7 inches  long by 3.5 inches wide (7.00”L X 3.5”W). 3.3.2.1   The camera mounting plate, once bolted to a camera of choice, shall enable the quick mount and dismount of the camera from the body of the camera mount.  The camera mounting plate shall be removed, along with its affixed camera, from the top of the camera mount. 3.3.2.2  The camera mount shall include a “hold down mechanism” for securely holding the camera mounting plate and attached camera to its top surface.  This “hold down mechanism” shall be engaged and disengaged solely with hand manipulation and without resort to tools. 3.3.2.2.1  This mechanism, once engaged, shall prohibit all movement of the camera mounting plate relatively to the body of the camera mount.  It shall maintain its hold when exposed to vibration. 3.3.2.3  The camera mounting plate shall be reversible.  This means the front of the plate can  be placed on the back or vice versa. 3.3.2.4  The camera mounting plate’s hole pattern for the camera shall be specified to the contractor during the duration of the contract. 3.3.3   The base plate shall have maximum dimension of 7 inches long by 4.25 inches wide (7.00”L X 4.25”W) 3.3.3.1  It shall have four countersunk holes with a minor diameter of 0.25 inch.  The hole pattern shall comply with figure 1. Figure 1.  Base Plate Hole Pattern 3.3.3.2     The base plate holes shall be accessible when the camera mount is set to 0 degrees in all axis’s.  This means the operator can put the bolts and tighten them without any angular adjustment FOR COPY OF FIGURE 1 - CONTACT CUC TRAN  562-626-7580 3.3.3.3     The contractor shall provide the nuts and bolts necessary to attach the camera mount to the existing angle bracket that has 3/8 inch thickness, and the bol ts for the camera to the mounting plate. 3.3.3.3.1  The bolts for the camera to the mounting plate shall be specified to the contractor during the duration of contract. 3.3.4    The camera mount shall be capable of holding camera that weigh at least seven (7) lbs. 3.3.5    The camera mount shall not contain or require any type of lubrication which may cause damage to the sensitive electronic component of the camera. 3.3.6    The friction caused by the materials when the camera mount is being adjusted shall not affect the fineness adjustment mentioned above and the capabilities of the camera mount. 3.3.7    The color of the camera mount shall comply according to the Federal Standard 595B with color identification 27038 (black). 3.3.8    The finish shall be hard anodized. 4.0  ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS 4.1   The camera mount shall be corrosion resistant.   It shall be constructed of aluminum, stainless steel and /or other materials that are resistant to moisture and salt brine air corrosion.  Resistance to galvanic corrosion by dissimilar materials is also required. 4.2  The camera mount shall sustain without any degradation of performance to the following environmental condition: Temperature:   -10 degree C to 50 degree C. Humidity:  0 to 95% relative humidity, non-condensing

<SUBJECT>60 -- Partnering Opportunity for Optical Sensor that Detects Interface Between a Clear and an Opaque Liquid
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories has described a fiber-optic sensor to detect the interface between a clear liquid and an opaque liquid.  The basic concept behind the optical sensor is that different liquids will absorb light at different levels.  Once the levels of absorbed light for the specific liquids to be identified can be determined, then the interface between the liquids can be located by the detection of the difference of the levels of light.  The location of the interface means the location of the different liquids in question.

Sandia’s goal is to apply the sensor to detecting the interface between crude oil and water.  Since water generally accompanies the production of crude oil, and the two liquids must be separated before the oil is to be processed into useful fuel sources, the sensor’s successful development has important implications for the oil industry.

In the near term, Sandia’s primary focus is in seeking companies interested in partnering opportunities for development of a prototype for this technology.  In the longer term, Sandia is interested in partnering with companies for future applications of this technology via licensing or cooperative development agreements. 

For further information, interested parties should contact Alane Dulski at Sandia National Laboratories by fax at 505-844-8011 or by email at adulsk@sandia.gov (No Phone Calls, Please).  Please indicate the date and title of this FBO notice and the type of partnering agreements your company would be most interested in entering into.

This contract is to procure a Farinograph E including WINFAR Software, Correlation Sofware and Micro-Mixer.  The system is replacing an older model (10 years old) Farinograph manufactured by C. W. Brabender to test flour quality traits.  It is critical that results generated are matched with results from the older model Farinograph.  Both models use sigma type blades for mixing dough, the mixing chamber is temperature controlled and the results are reported as a Farinograph Curve that is not comparable to curves that are generated with other dough-strength measuring instruments.  Research results generated over the past 10 years on dough strength characteristics of different wheat cultivars can be compared under similar mixing conditions.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation: firm-fixed price proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA- 04-Q-0013        and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14 effective June 23, 2003. The Term of the contract will be for a Base period of (12) months plus four (4) twelve (12) month Option Periods. This is a 100% small business set aside under NAICS 519120 with a size of $6 million. The Government reserves the right to make an award on the initial quote without discussions of this procurement. Award will be based on a best value determination, price and other factors considered. Other factors for award include past performance and a responsible offerors ability to meet the salient functional and technical requirements as listed below for the Replacement Copy Card Access Control System.  Background:  During FY 2002, nearly 12,000 new researchers registered for use of NARA’s Washington, DC area research rooms. Total visitors to these research rooms (new and repeat researchers) exceeded 100,000 for the year. These researchers used NARA’s self-service reprographics equipment to make nearly 3.4 million copies during FY 2002. The self-service reprographics access control system allows NARA to provide copying capability to researchers at three facilities in the Washington, DC metropolitan area:  

National Archives and Records Administration
700 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20408

National Archives and Records Administration
4205 Suitland Road,
Suitland, MD 20746-8001

National Archives at College Park
8601 Adelphi Road
College Park, MD 20740-6001 

Presently, researchers using the NARA’s research rooms purchase a copy card from a card dispenser for $1.  They can then increase the value of the card by reinserting it into the dispenser and inserting the desired amount of money.  The dispenser updates the card and returns it to the user.  Researchers use this card to make copies with the available reprographics equipment by inserting the card into the card reader attached to the equipment.  The card reader displays the value of the card and decrements it as copies are made.  NARA staff preprograms the copy cost into each card reader.  Costs are different for different types of copy machines

NARA employees use administrative cards to record copies against a user or department.  When these cards are inserted into the card reader it increments the number of copies against the card number stored in the reader.  NARA Staff print summary reports for each administrative card and consolidate it for billing purposes.

As part of this upgrade NARA requires the ability to limit the maximum card amount and change that limit as required without programmer intervention, accept major credit cards and enter and record copy costs up to $99.99.  The card dispensers because of weight, cost to count and cost to transport, must not accept coins.  The NARA facilities are available outside of normal business hours.  This will require that the equipment is easy to operate and very stable as NARA staff will not be available to assist users with problems. Requirements: The replacement system must be card-based and include components to vend copy cards to users, add value to existing copy cards, deduct the appropriate fee for each copy made on NARA’s self-service reprographics equipment, and report usage on the various components.  The replacement system does not need to be compatible with the system currently used by NARA.  Most users of the card system will be one-time or short time users so a "One-Card," multi-purpose, account card system will not be suitable. 

At a minimum, the replacement system must include the following components: 

&#61607;	Magnetic stripe user cards
&#61607;	Card readers to be attached to a variety of reprographics equipment (paper-to paper copiers, microfilm reader-printers, book copiers, public access PC printers, etc.) from a number of manufactures (currently: OCE, Cannon, Xerox, Kodak and Minolta).
&#61607;	Customer self-service card vending dispensers capable of accepting US currency and encoding the currency value on the magnetic stripe card dispensed.
&#61607;	Customer self-service card vending dispensers capable of accepting US currency and major credit cards (VISA, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, etc.) and encoding the currency value on the magnetic stripe card dispensed.
&#61607;	Card encoders for designated staff use which do not require currency or credit cards to encode value on cards but which do require the use of a password to operate.
&#61607;	Portable printers or report writers to be used on card readers, dispensers, and encoders to periodically report activity on the particular component (card reader, etc.).

Proposed equipment must meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In addition, all proposals must include service agreements, with guaranteed response time within 9 business hours, Monday through Friday,

2.1 	Magnetic Stripe Cards
The card must be made of a hard plastic, similar to a credit card. It should be customizable on its face with artwork unique to NARA. Cards must be uniquely coded for use only at NARA —cards from similar systems installed at other institutions must not operate NARA equipment. Table 1 identifies the minimum number of cards required by NARA.  Three types of cards will be needed: 

&#61607;	Public use cards encoded with dollar values to be debited for each "copy" at the card reader.
&#61607;	Administrative use cards encoded with an account number that will authorize "bypass copies" to be recorded on the card reader.
&#61607;	Supervisor cards to be used in conjunction with a programmable password to reset sales unit fees on card readers, lock out lost administrative use cards, etc. 

NARA issues public use with an initial value of $0 or $1. They must be capable of regeneration in increments of $1 at a dispenser (no coins are allowed) or staff-encoder. Deductions from the value recorded on the card will be made in whole cents but the sale unit value may vary between 1¢ and $99.99 (cost per click). Cards will be encoded with a variable dollar amount, which will be debited by the appropriate amount at the reprographics equipment. The amount per reprographics vend will vary depending upon the type of copier to with the card reader is attached. NARA must be able to set a maximum limit on the value of a card.  They must be able to change that limit with out programmer support at any time. 

NARA issues Administrative use cards with no value. They enable the card reader to operate in "credit" mode and record any copies made on copier in the attached card reader. To accomplish this, each card is encoded with a unique account (department) code. 

NARA Staff use Supervisor cards to reprogram/reset other components of the system. They cannot be used to enable copying. Two levels of passwords are desirable: Report/Reset and Reprogram. 

The Minimum Magnetic Stripe Cards Required
For Public Users the Initial Purchase will be 35,0000 the Yearly Requirement will be 35,000. Administrative Cards the Initial Purchase will be 200 the Yearly Requirement will be 50. For Supervisor Cards the Initial Purchase will be 25 and the Yearly Requirement will be 5. 


2.3 	Card Readers
Card readers will not be networked. They must operate in a stand-alone mode. The card reader must operate with all currently used reprographics equipment (multiple copier models, multiple microfilm reader-printer models) and such potentially chargeable copy devices as PC printers, fax machines, digital scanners, etc. Cable harnesses must be available to ensure compatibility with any replacement equipment that NARA may acquire in the future. NARA will require at least 52 card readers for initial deployment. Additional card readers may be required. 

The card reader should display silent prompts to the user. When a public use copy card is inserted, it should display the current balance on the card, updated as copies are made. When an administrative copy card is inserted, it should display the current copy count for the account (department). When the card reader malfunctions, it should display the appropriate error code(s) to be reported to the service department. In the event of a power failure, it should have an internal battery backup to retain copying usage information for up to 7 days. NARA staff must be able to reprogram copy fees on the card reader with the use of a supervisor card and a password. NARA staff should be able to reprogram the password without service intervention. Copy usage statistics should be available from the card reader in both display mode and print mode and optionally via download to electronic media.  Proposals must specify the power requirements for the card readers.

2.4 	Card Dispensers
Two types of public use, copy card dispensers will be required. The first type will accept US currency only and the second type will accept US currency and major credit cards (VISA, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express). For initial deployment, NARA will require at least 5 credit card capable dispensers and at least 5 currency only dispensers. Dispensers must be capable of: 

&#61607;	Issuing paper receipts for the customers that include date, time, amount of the sale, and the payment type (“Cash” and “Credit” acceptable). 
&#61607;	Displaying the balance remaining on a public use copy card.
&#61607;	Regenerating public use copy cards with new value 
&#61607;	Accepting US paper currency in $1, $5, $10, and $20 denominations and encoding the value on the card dispensed (primary transaction) or regenerated.  No coins will be accepted.
&#61607;	Being programmed for a maximum amount (to be determined by NARA) that can be encoded on a card. 
&#61607;	Recognizing an administrative copy card and ejecting it without encoding 
&#61607;	Accommodating up to 500 bills in currency acceptor bins. 
&#61607;	Storing at least 300 cards in the card dispenser bins. 

Card dispensers must be lockable and uniquely keyed for NARA. Additional keys must be available to NARA.  They must be updateable for currency recognition, including recognizing colors. They must fit the physical space of the current equipment 12”x 48” or incorporate their own stands. Proposals must specify the power requirements for the card dispensers, as well as any telecommunications requirements. 

Dispensers must display silent prompts to the user. They should have a digital screen that will guide the customer through the transaction. Menu-driven displays are acceptable, as are touch-screen displays. When the card dispenser malfunctions, it should display the appropriate error code(s) to be reported to the service department. In the event of a power failure, it should have an internal battery backup to retain sales information for up to 7 days. NARA staff must be able to reprogram/reset the sales information on the dispenser with the use of a supervisor card and a password. NARA staff should be able to reprogram the password without service intervention. Sales data should be available from the card dispenser in both display mode and print/download mode.

2.5 	Staff Encoders
Staff encoders will be used by designated NARA staff to encode value on public use copy cards for all payment types accepted by NARA (cash, credit card, purchase orders, etc.). The sale-specific data will be captured on the existing NARA POS system. The staff encoders must be capable of displaying the current balance on any public use copy card, even if that balance is not readable on a card reader or card dispenser. When the staff encoder malfunctions, it should display the appropriate error code(s) to be reported to the service department. In the event of a power failure, it should have an internal battery backup to retain statistical information for up to 7 days. NARA staff must be able to reprogram/reset the statistical information on the encoder with the use of a supervisor card and a password. NARA staff should be able to reprogram the password without service intervention. Statistical data should be available from the staff encoder in both display mode and print/download mode. At a minimum, the data must include the total value encoded and the number of cards encoded. Proposals must specify the power requirements for the staff encoders. NARA will required at least 6 staff encoders at initial deployment.

2.6 	Portable Printers / Report Writers
Proposals must include portable printers or portable report writers capable of extracting audit reports from each of the card handling system components. Proposed printers must include any cables or harnesses necessary for operations. Minimum report requirements are itemized in Attachment 1. NARA will require at least 4 printers/report writers at initial deployment.
