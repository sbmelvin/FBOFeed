<DESC>The objective of VIBE is to develop combat identification (CID) automatic target recognition (ATR) for vibrometry sensor data for use within anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) environments. The technologies developed in VIBE must demonstrate robust, efficient, high-performance, and sustainable technology.
<p>Laser vibrometry technology is now sufficiently mature to implement automatic target recognition capabilities. Vibrometry sensors utilize the principal of micro-Doppler measurements between the sensor and target caused by surface deflections. These deflections are due to vibrations mainly caused by mechanical systems (motors) or transformer hum (magnetostriction) during operation of military and civilian vehicles and equipment.  These measurements enhance air-to-ground (A/G) and air-to-air (A/A) remote identification of targets. The addition of vibration measurement to the sensor suite provides an additional non-imagery based identification modality at ranges where traditional electro-optical imaging is resolution limited. The vibrometry modality also provides unique capabilities in settings where a vibration signature is available such as facility interrogation, power plant assessment, obscured targets, and Battle Damage Assessment (BDA).</p>
<p>Remote vibration sensors are currently under development for combat identification applications. Since the output from such systems is not readily human-interpretable, developing automated processing to assist in the exploitation of signatures from these non-imaging sensors is a critical step in delivering the technology to the warfighter. Vibration signatures sensed from distant vehicles using laser vibrometry systems provide valuable information that may be used to help identify key vehicle features such as engine type, engine speed, number of cylinders, vehicle type, or a fingerprint of the target for identification/recognition tasks.</p>
<p>Preliminary work has been performed in which classification algorithms were trained and tested on identical vehicles. However, many factors can affect the observed signal resulting in variability in measurements even from the same vehicle. The vibration signature can vary significantly depending on the sensing location, state of engine degradation and tuning, engine operating conditions, structural loading as well as many other parameters. Thus, the challenge innate to this work is robustly extracting salient features from vibrometry signatures that remain consistent and meaningful even though the signatures vary significantly between "identical" vehicles for tactical range laser vibrometry.</p>
<p>VIBE will leverage current state of the art technology to perform A/G CID ATR using laser vibrometry. The government is not interested in any solution which relies on contractor proprietary hardware, software, or data. VIBE consists of a basic algorithm development effort with 4 options to be exercised based on the performance and promise of the developed ATR.</p>

<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-16-00296 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception:
(i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold
(ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE.
(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.  Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.

<RESPDATE>112515
<CONTACT>Safouane Elalaoui, Contract Specialist, Phone 5082336120, Email safouane.elalaoui.civ@mail.mil - Curtis Britton, Contracting Officer, Phone 5082336150, Email curtis.l.britton.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Solicitation No. W911QY-16-R-0008. The US Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division (NCD) on behalf of Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM-FSS), located at the Natick Soldier Systems Center intends to issue a solicitation under the authority of FAR Part 15 for the Extracted High and Low Speed Container Delivery System (EHLSCDS).
<p>The Government is anticipating awarding a single Firm Fixed Price Five Year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract for Operational Testing and Production. The Government reserves the right to award one or no contracts as a result of the solicitation. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 314999 (All Other Miscellaneous Textile Product Mills), and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>When released, the formal solicitation, including all amendments and applicable documents, will be available in electronic medium on or about 25 November 2015 via FBO.gov (TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED). Offerors must register in the System for Award Management (SAM) at SAM.gov prior to submission of proposals. It is the offeror's responsibility to check the Internet address provided as necessary for any posted changes to this solicitation and all amendments.</p>
<p>Background: Extracted High and Low Speed Container Delivery System (EHLSCDS) is a significant evolution of the current Container Delivery System (CDS) method of airdrop. It is designed for deployment from both C-130 and C-17 aircraft at maximum ramp-open airspeed from as low as 375 feet Above Ground Level. This capability provides commanders the ability to conduct exceptionally accurate low altitude resupply airdrops to combat troops on the ground while allowing the aircraft to maintain maneuverability at the higher airspeed. The higher airspeed reduces threat exposure to the aircraft while the ground troops benefit from reduced dispersion on the Drop Zone (DZ) because of the low altitude and extraction method of airdrop. The increased accuracy and reduced dispersion also allows for the use of much smaller DZs. The EHLSCDS design was developed during a successful 2011-2013 Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD).</p>
<p>The contractor shall manufacture the EHLSCDS components and spare parts in accordance with Government provided technical drawings. In addition, the contractor will also provide airdrop test/training support, repair services and engineering assistance. The contractor may also develop, prepare, and submit value engineering change proposals (VECPs).</p>
<p>The contractor's primary focus shall be to:<br />1. Manufacture EHLSCDS components and spare parts.<br />2. Provide airdrop test and training support. This includes packing parachutes, rigging bundles, recovering<br />airdropped loads and preparing reports. This support will occur at multiple government facilities to include Yuma Proving Ground, AZ, Fort Bragg, NC, Natick Soldier Systems Center, MA and Fort Lee, VA.<br />3. Provide repairs to test assets as required.<br />4. Provide engineering support as required.<br />5. Participate in meetings as required.</p>
<p>Manufacture - Build to Print:<br />&bull; 45-Foot Main Parachute, G-15<br />&bull; Pilot Parachute, G-15<br />&bull; Extraction Parachute System,<br />&bull; A-24 Container<br />&bull; Spare Parts</p>
<p><br />It is anticipated that proposals shall include the following volumes.</p>
<p>Volume I. Past Performance<br />Volume II. Technical/Manufacturing<br />Volume III. Management <br />Volume IV. Cost/Price <br />Volume V. Administrative: Section I: Executive Summary; Section II: Solicitation&nbsp; Documents; Section III: DCMA POCs, CAGE,DUNs and TIN; Section IV:&nbsp; Representations &amp; Certifications; Section V: Financial Documentation; Section VI: Signed Teaming Agreements (if applicable).</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a question and answer session will be available during the first fifteen (15) days after a solicitation is released.</p>
<p>Questions shall be submitted to Safoune Elalaoui via FBO.gov 15 days prior to Request for Proposal closing date. The Government will provide its response through FBO.gov via amendments. The Government will not guarantee a response to any question and/or clarifications after the submission deadline in the solicitation.</p>

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals to demonstrate that a maritime system of systems (SoS) approach can provide increased military effectiveness, cost imposition (i.e., the cost of the opponent to counter relative to the cost of the U.S. to deploy), and adaptability necessary to maintain U.S. maritime superiority in contested maritime environments. Specifically, the Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program will develop SoS architectures for wide area, cross-domain (under, on and over the sea) surveillance and targeting of adversary ships and submarines in order to close kill chains and dominate large contested maritime regions.

<DESC>NASA/LARC has a requirement for PBS Professional Software License Renewal. <p> NASA/LARC intends to purchase the items from Altair Engineering Inc. Altair is the developer and sole provider of the proprietary software. It is imperative the software is compatible with the existing PBS software in use at NASA to ensure that the workflow and scripts that are developed on the mid-range systems will work on the high-end computers at NASA. It would take substantial duplication of resources and time for another source to provide the required service, and this additional expense is not expected to be recovered through competition. <p> The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. <p> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 11/20/2015.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. <p> Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. <p> All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. <p> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>This is a NOTICE of INTENT the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Clinical Center (CC), Office of Purchasing and Contracts (OPC), on behalf of the CC/OPC Office of Clinical Research Training and Medical Education (OCRTME) intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis and award a contract for the administrative support and oversight of graduate medical education programs to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education under NAICS code 611710. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).<br /><br />The NIH Clinical Center is the sponsoring institution at the NIH responsible for the administrative support and oversight of graduate medical education programs designed to train physicians, recruited through a competitive nation-wide search process, in a total of 18 nationally recognized medical/surgical specialties. These graduate medical education programs provide prescribed structured, standardized clinical and research training experiences to these physicians that permits their certification as specialists in a recognized medical or surgical field by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), a national organization that has established a process for verifying the competence of individual physicians in such recognized medical or surgical specialty fields. However, the prescribed standards and program structure required for the training for physicians in a given medical or surgical specialty field are developed and verified, both for training programs and institutions which sponsor those training programs, through a national process of accreditation established by another organization, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), located in Chicago, Illinois. The ACGME is a private, non-profit organization that accredits approximately 8,700 residency programs in 130 specialties or subspecialties that educate about 109,000 residents nationally. Its mission is to improve health care nationally by assessing and advancing the quality of resident physicians' education through an exemplary accreditation process. <br /><br />Graduate medical education training programs and those institutions that sponsor medical or surgical training programs in a recognized specialty field, such as the NIH Clinical Center, are expected to be accredited by the ACGME in order to permit training program graduates to be certified by the ABMS. It should be noted that those graduate medical education programs and sponsoring institutions that are not accredited by the ACGME are not recognized as providing the required training that permits physicians to be certified as medical or surgical specialists by the ABMS. Thus, physicians who complete specialty training in non-ACGME accredited programs, with rare exception, are not eligible for certification by the ABMS, and are not considered bona fide medical or surgical specialists by health care delivery organizations, medical schools, and academic medical centers throughout the United States. Finally, many states require completion of an ACGME-accredited training program before granting a license to practice medicine and surgery. Thus, accreditation of both individual graduate medical education programs, and the NIH Clinical Center as a sponsor of graduate medical education on the NIH campus, by the ACGME is essential for the NIH Clinical Center and the NIH to meet its mission of training highly competent (i.e., ABMS certified) and qualified physician-scientists and clinician-investigators in the recognized specialty fields of medicine or surgery. <br /><br />The ACGME is a private, non-profit organization that accredits approximately 8,700 residency programs in 130 specialties or subspecialties that educate about 109,000 residents nationally, and no other national accreditation institution satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Lymphoid Malignancies Branch (LMB), plans to procure on a sole source basis laboratory supplies for Tet-free fetal bovine serum for cell culture that is manufactured by Atlanta Biologicals, 2150 Cedars Road, Suite 200, Lawrenceville, GA 30043. <br />
<p><br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219 and the business size standard is $20.5M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The delivery date period of performance is one (1) to five (5) days from date of award of the purchase order.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Lymphoid Malignancies Branch studies the molecular mechanisms of B cell lymphomagenesis with the goal of identifying new molecular targets for therapy. A critical part of this effort is the growth of cell line models of various lymphomas in tissue culture. This requires TET (tetracycline)-free fetal bovine serum (FBS).</p>
<p>The laboratory has been dedicated to the aforementioned goals for over two decades. The FBS used in tissue culture must come from the same supplier as previously used to ensure continuity of our work. Changing suppliers would require suspension of all mission-critical research and several months of testing new suppliers.</p>
<p>Fetal Bovine Serum is an essential component of all projects performed in the laboratory. The specific formulation and quality of FBS from Atlanta Biologicals is required for the research to proceed. Changing suppliers would require the total suspension of all research for weeks to months while other suppliers' products were tested. The contractor shall provide a total quantity of 120, lot number F14083, size 500 ml of Fetal Bovine Serum - TET Tested.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 11:00AM EST, on November 25, 2015. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed (240) 276-5401 or emailed to Kathy Elliott, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at Elliottk@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, Contractors must be registered and have valid, current Entity Record, including current Representations and Certifications, in the System for Award Management (SAM) through SAM.gov.

ORIGIN. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control
activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate
source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification
procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having
jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item
requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is
flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined
adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the
source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been
solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that
an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an
approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information
detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source
Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx

The goal of any proposed effort should be to provide solutions that will establish and maintain a diverse pipeline of U.S. citizens who are interested in uniformed or civilian DoN (or Navy and Marine Corps) STEM related workforce opportunities.
<p>While this announcement is relevant for any stage of the STEM pipeline, funding efforts will be targeted primarily towards the future DoN (naval) STEM workforce in High Schools, all categories of Post-Secondary institutions, the STEM research enterprise, and efforts that enhance the current naval STEM workforce and its mission readiness. Efforts may encompass a spectrum of project sizes from exploratory pilots to large-scale regional or national initiatives. The technical content of any idea must establish naval relevance within the broad scope of key engineering and scientific areas as outlined in the Naval S&amp;T Strategic Plan, or such as our National Naval Responsibilities (see ONR website), or any identified gaps in workforce needs.</p>
<p>Specific audience priority areas may include, but not be limited to, military dependent children, education systems integral to the naval science and technology enterprise, and veteran initiatives that improve education outcomes and connections to naval STEM careers. While not a formal requirement or program focus of this FOA, applicants are strongly encouraged to consider under-represented populations including women and minorities in project plans.</p>

The selected firms will be competitively chosen in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and source selection procedures using the Best Value trade-off process.

The governments intent is to award to (5) five offerors who submit proposals which will provide the best value to the government in terms of technical qualifications and price.

<SUBJECT>Equipment Availability for In Situ Turbine Runner Repair
<SOLNBR>R16PS00024
<RESPDATE>120815
<CONTACT>Richard Beeman, Phone 801-524-3653, Email rbeeman@usbr.gov
<DESC>The United States Bureau of Reclamation is hereby soliciting information pertaining to potential sources for automated welding and machining equipment. The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate automated welding and machine equipment and operations for use in weld and recontour repairs on an ASTM A743 CF-3 stainless steel hydroelectric turbine runner. The turbine runner is in operation at Flaming Gorge Hydroelectric Dam near the town of Dutch John, Utah. The repair would be performed in situ without physically disassembling each unit, leaving the welding operations in an overhead configuration. Other aspects of the repair would be machining a contour change into the turbine runner. Each individual work area would be less than 75 in2 (483 cm2) repeated seventeen times in an angular pattern around a conic section 46 in (117 cm) at the largest diameter on the unit.
<p>The potential contractor would be an expert in and have substantial experience with the development and utilization of automated welding and machining equipment. It would be anticipated that the contractor would assemble a team having the appropriate technical expertise and experience, to develop a set of custom equipment components.</p>
<p>A potential order of operations for the repair would be similar to:</p>
<p>- Using computer aided design software, develop a revised contour surface mesh of the area around and immediate to the existing damage.<br />- Design, build and install a structural operation platform beneath the turbine runner on which to fix the automated equipment.<br />- Install automated equipment.<br />- Enter the datum and necessary code for the automated equipment to perform repair operations.<br />- Machine the damaged area to a known geometry, as well as remove excess material pertinent to any contour changes.<br />- Lay in weld material to rebuild the profile pertinent to any contour changes.<br />- Machine excess material to form a final revised contour.<br />- Dynamically balance the rotating assembly.<br />- Enter the datum and necessary code for the automated equipment to deposit augmenting material.<br />- Lay in weld to augment material for balancing.<br />- Machine excess material to achieve final dynamic balance.<br />- Remove all repair equipment.</p>
<p>Aside from the operational envelope, 101 in (40.8 cm) in diameter by 84 in (33 cm) tall, a major limiting factor would be the access portal to the operational envelope. This work area would be accessed through a trapezoidal opening 30 in (76.2 cm) tall, with a 25.75 in (65.4 cm) width at the bottom and a 22 in (55.9 cm), width at the top. Therefore, the necessary equipment would need to be able to be configured so as to pass through the access portal. If the access portal size creates an absolute operational barrier there would be the potential of increasing the opening size, in turn include in any offering, the smallest access portal size necessary within the cost estimate. The access would be at the end of a 15 ft (4.5 m) gallery. Any large peripheral operational items, welding equipment cabinets, or remote consoles would need to have at least 25 ft (7.5 m), of lead for the cables and controls. Any standardized power requirements would be considered.</p>
<p>A site visit for interested parties will be held on November 18,2015, from the Flaming Gorge Visitor&iquest;s Center at Flaming Gorge Dam, Dutch John, UT, beginning at 9:00 AM Local Time. Participants planning to attend the site visit must send the company name, and name of attendees, in writing, to:</p>
<p>Robert Branch. FG-<br />Flaming Gorge Field Division<br />5995 Flaming Gorge Field Division<br />Dutch John, UT 84023<br />Email: rbranch@usbr.gov</p>
<p>at least three (3) days before the date of the site visit.</p>
<p>Interested offerors/vendors having the specialized equipment to meet any or all of the above requirements should submit a capability statement of 10 pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. It is not sufficient to provide only general brochures or generic information.</p>
<p>Responses must include the following:<br />1) Company name and address<br />2) Business size classification (Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) including the number of employees and the number of years in business<br />3) Provide information demonstrating your technical capability to deliver equipment suited to the requirements described above and the details of the automated welding and machine operation. In addition submit a maximum of 5 government or commercial contracts in the last 5 years demonstrating your relevant experience; In addition to the description of the contracts also include contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and point of contact &iquest; address and phone number;<br />4) Include a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for any proposed equipment or services integral to the repair listed above. Identify major cost drivers that impact this ROM including the cost of any proposed equipment, the cost of any training for the operation of equipment beyond standard computer aided design (CAD) or computer numerical control (CNC) equipment and software, as well as peripheral equipment requirements.<br />5) Include a summary of any unique contract conditions desired.</p>
<p>No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in &iquest;FedBizOpps.gov&iquest;. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.</p>
<p>All inquiries or responses shall be submitted to:</p>
<p>Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Region<br />Attn: Richard Beeman, UC-841<br />125 South State Street, Room 8100<br />Salt Lake City, UT 84138</p>

2. The Contractor/laboratory may not sub contract any analysis out.

3.  In order to receive an award the laboratory shall be approved by Mid-Pacific Regions Quality Assurance and Data Management Branch, MP-156.  Approval will include but not be limited to passing a Quality Assurance Audit as stated below, receiving an acceptable review of the laboratorys QA Manual, round-robin performance evaluation samples, and reporting limits.

Audit Process:

The MP-156 quality assurance (QA) section conducts audits on laboratories involved in analytical activities that support Mid-Pacific Region projects.  The audit consists of reviewing the laboratorys QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results, submitting performance evaluation samples, and conducting an onsite audit.  The review process allows the QA section to determine if laboratories are capable of performing quality analyses on Mid-Pacific Region samples while following QA/QC practices that meet or exceed Mid-Pacific Region standards and protocols.

Background Review:

Prior to the audit, the QA section will contact the laboratory QA officer or the laboratory director and request a copy of both the current QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results.  The performance study results and QA manual are reviewed by the QA section.
  
Performance Evaluation Samples:

Prior to the onsite audit, the QA section conducts a performance audit by submitting performance evaluation samples.  The purpose of the performance evaluation samples is to evaluate the laboratorys ability to generate accurate data.  If the laboratory performs poorly on the performance evaluation samples, the QA section may consider not conducting the onsite audit.  The parameters submitted for the performance evaluation samples will be tailored to reflect those of current Mid-Pacific Region projects and the methods the laboratory performs.  

If the laboratory does not obtain a result within the acceptance criteria, the laboratory will be directed to reanalyze the sample(s).  If the reanalyzed result is within the acceptance criteria, then the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory still does not meet the acceptance criteria upon reanalysis, a new performance evaluation sample from a different lot or vendor will be submitted.  If the laboratory can obtain an acceptable result on the new performance evaluation sample, the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory does not meet the acceptance on the original, reanalysis, or new performance evaluation sample, the laboratory will not be audited or approved for this method/parameter.

Audit Agenda:

Approximately one week prior to the audit, the auditor will send the laboratory contact a proposed audit agenda.  The audit agenda details the time allotted for the initial meeting with management, analytical method review, document review, and debrief.  After laboratory review and approval, the audit agenda will be finalized. 

Onsite Audit:

An onsite laboratory audit is conducted by the QA section to assess the laboratorys expertise in conducting the analyses, the capability for producing valid data, the ability to effectively support the data, and the integrity of the QA/QC practices.
  
Meet with Management:

The first step of the audit will be to meet with management and key laboratory personnel to discuss the purpose of the audit and give a general overview about the Mid-Pacific Region and the Quality Assurance and Data Management Branch (MP-156).  During this meeting, the audit team will discuss MP-156s policies and requirements, the performance evaluation sample results (if available), document request, and questions for the QA Officer (QAO).   

Analytical Method and Document Review:

During the onsite audit, the QA officer, analysts, and other key laboratory personnel are questioned to determine their overall understanding of the methods and laboratory procedures.  Documentation practices are also reviewed.  In general, the auditors are checking to see if the laboratory procedures follow the laboratorys QA manual guidelines and the EPA method, Standard method, or other method protocols.
Debrief:

The most serious deviations are presented to the laboratory as findings in a debrief meeting at the end of the audit; the debrief is generally conducted the day after the audit.  All the deviations are written as findings or observations in the final audit report. 
 
Audit Report:

Any deviations from accepted protocols are written in an audit report as findings.  The report can also include good practices for any procedures that the auditors would like the laboratory to continue and observations for any procedures that the auditors would like the laboratory to adopt. 
 
Laboratory Audit Response and Final Approval Letter:

The laboratory is asked to send a response to each finding detailed in the QA sections audit report.  The auditors will review this response and assess if the corrective actions and explanations are acceptable.  If any response is questionable, the laboratory is contacted for clarification.

Once the review of the laboratorys audit response is complete, the lead auditor will send a final letter addressing whether or not the laboratory is approved for use.
 
System for Award Management (SAM), as required by FAR 4.1102, applies to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on SAM registration can be obtained via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov.

<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is (1) to assess industry interest in a new method of establishing alternative sources of supply and (2) to research potential constructs of the new methodology.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p>Field and depot level repairs are conducted within the government and are planned in advance to posture parts, tooling, and equipment; however, at times, unforseen circumstances have created unacceptable delays. These circumstances have normally been due to parts shortages caused by erratic demand rates, inaccurate shelf lives, obsolescence of parts, or diminishing sources. An effort is underway to mitigate the risk of these unforeseen circumstances by establishing a contract with an end item supplier which is incentivized by schedule or availability of the subcomponents within that end item. The goal of this RFI is to assess industry interest in such a contract and determine the most suitable way to create a sustaining partnership which benefits both private industry and the government.</p>
<h1>Program Objectives</h1>
<p>The primary objective of the new effort will be to support the warfighter during unexpected part shortages by creating an alternative source or sources of supply. To achieve this primary objective, a contractor would be incentivized by the availability of parts, as measured by the time a demand was known to the time it was filled. The method in which the contractor meets the objective has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>At this time the Government is researching two specific end items. Interested sources should contact the Contracting Officer to obtain additional information about the two specific end items.<br /></p>
<h1>Hypothetical Support Methods</h1>
<p>As part of its Market Research, the Government is seeking feedback on potential acquisition strategies. Some initial ideas are listed below. In response to this RFI, please comment on each of these strategies and provide any other suggestions that could address the problem explained in this RFI.</p>

ONRR is transforming its framework for geospatial information and migrating from exclusively reacting to discrete product requirement-submissions to using methodologies that deliver content through user interaction with a web-based service.  ONRR is pursuing applications, services, and technological ideas to expand its Geographic Information Systems GIS services to the ONRR community.  ONRR seeks to make geospatial data, tools, technology, and services more accessible, discoverable, sharable, reusable, and reliable to the ONRR community which includes State, local, and tribal governments.&nbsp;<br /><br />ONRR currently performs analyses and delivers GIS products on an as-needed basis. A team of GIS analysts reviews requests, performs analyses, and creates products in response to the request. ONRR does not have a user interface that allows individual users to view the data, perform analysis, or create cartographic products or reports. ONRR uses the Department of Interior (DOI) standard GIS software provided by ESRI. Internal GIS developers use ESRI products to create, update, and maintain data and products with data stored primarily in the file geodatabase format. Several file geodatabases are comprised of a variety of data assembled from several sources internal and external in ESRI formats or derived from ESRI formats.</span></p>
<p>The contractor shall be capable of furnishing all required labor, material, facilities and equipment to develop an enterprise-level GIS with the characteristics listed below.<br /> <br />1.	Multiple users:  ONRR has approximately 600 users.  Of those users about 10 percent will be accessing the system simultaneously. Users have role-level definitions.  We require the ability to scale to external users.<br />2.	Multiple physical locations:  Users will access the system from several geographic locations with users in both ONRR facilities and non-ONRR facilities. Access to the system is through direct desktop connections, virtual private networks, and Citrix.<br />3.	Web-based:  This will be a web-based system.<br />4.	User role-based access:  ONRR users can access the GIS based on roles to create, view, and analyze data, and produce products such as maps, charts, and graphs.<br />5.	Centralized data:  The data are centralized in a relational database management system such as Oracle or SQL Server.<br />6.	Multiple data sources:  The system will incorporate data acquired from several organizations including Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), United States Geological Survey (USGS), and private industry.<br />7.	Data integration:  Data integrated into the system are stored in multiple formats including ESRI, Oracle, SQL Server, MS Access, and MS Excel.<br />8.	Internal developers:  ONRR GIS developers can manage data and objects, perform analyses, produce products, and build web applications, queries and scripts. <br />9.	Metadata:  Metadata will meet Federal standards and are accessible and searchable.<br />10.	System security:   System security meets Federal standards and utilizes the organizations established roles.</p>
<p>Companies interested in performing the work specified and can meet the requirements stated above, should provide a description of technical capabilities to provide a GIS, with associated maintenance and services, using commercial off-the-shelf GIS software, as follows:</p>
<p>1.	Provide a description of your ability and the methods you would use to incorporate web-based visualization in the GIS. These would be simple desktop tools that provide easy internet access to geospatial data and would be used by analysts and decision-makers to quickly and easily display data.  You may describe how data, maps, charts, and reports are to be used and how users analyze data, maps, charts, and reports.</p>
<p>2.	Provide a description of your ability and the methods you would use to incorporate geospatial analytics and modeling in a GIS.  The GIS will be used for a variety of interdisciplinary research and analyses by auditors, engineers, scientists, and compliance specialists in the energy industry. This will require combined use of vector and raster data, and the ability to manage and visualize complex spatial relationships. It will also be used for spatial data analysis, editing, and viewing, web distribution, and creation and management of spatial metadata. ONRR GIS developers shall be able to develop custom scripts, queries, models, web pages, objects, and metadata.</p>
<p>3.	Describe how the system would allow ONRR GIS developers to develop custom scripts, queries, models, web pages, objects, and metadata.</p>
<p>4.	Provide a description of your ability and the methods you would use to integrate a variety of data in multiple formats into a GIS. ONRR receives data from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, internal ONRR, BLM, BOEM, BIA, USGS, and private industry. These data are produced in ESRI formats and delivered in a variety of formats including ESRI, Oracle, SQL Server, MA Access, MS Excel, and text files.</p>
<p>5.	Describe how you would create, structure, and maintain the databases necessary to store the data.  Include a description of what methods you would use to continuously collect, process, and update data from the external sources listed in item 4.</p>
<p>6.	Describe your ability and the methods you would use to integrate internal data that is continuously changing with and without a direct connection to that data in the formats listed in item 4.</p>
<p>7.	Provide a description of your technical capabilities to provide a GIS that functions in WAN/LAN and/or cloud environments integrating with ONRR role-based security.  ONRR has several offices in many geographic locations that will access this GIS. GIS users and developers access the system through direct desktop connections, virtual private networks, and Citrix.  Include a description of the infrastructure foundation that provides for scalability and future growth whether WAN/LAN or cloud-based (private or external).</p>
<p>8.	ONRR is currently using ESRI products and needs to be able to share data and products with partners that use ESRI-based systems.  If you propose a non-ESRI-based solution describe your approach to migrating from an ESRI-based system to a non-ESRI system.  Include a description of how you would allow the non-ESRI system to share products and data with ESRI-based systems.</p>
<p>9.	Provide a description of how you would organize personnel to administer and manage the GIS.  Include how you would structure support staff and the types and number of positions with the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for those positions.</p>
<p>10.	Describe your familiarity, capability, and relevant experience with providing a GIS to the Federal government community.  You may include in your response compliance with Federal Enterprise Architecture, security and standards.  Address cooperation with other entities such as State, local and tribal governments.</p>
<p>11.	Provide a description of support services you would provide including, but not limited to, hardware and software administration, maintenance and upgrades, technical support, troubleshooting and resolution of issues, survey for and recommendations of additions and improvements, future expansion, future changes in scope or scale, and training (i.e. workbooks, training manuals, videos, and courses both instructor-led and web-based).</p>
<p>12.	Provide a description of your ability and the methods you would use to create, update, and maintain the appropriate maintenance, operation, technical, and training documentation.</p>
<p>13.	Describe how you would create, update, and maintain metadata including the process and the tools you would use.</p>
<p>14.	Provide a cost estimate with an order of magnitude or a range that would be necessary to create, establish, maintain, and expand over time a GIS.  At a minimum, consider and incorporate into the estimate hardware and software with licensing and maintenance, support services, personnel, training, and documentation.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT.  IT IS NOT A SOLICITATION, NOR DOES IT GUARANTEE A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.
<p>Any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Announcement is strictly voluntary.  The Government will neither award a contract solely based on this notice, nor pay for any information submitted by respondents.  This notice is a request by the Government to collect information from interested vendors for the purpose of market research.  Failing to provide a response to this announcement will not prohibit/exclude an interested vendor from participating in a future solicitation.</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) seeks a contractor for the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) to support and provide sustaining engineering support for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) Data Collection System (DCS).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong></p>
<p>The GOES DCS is a national critical system, delivering an estimated six million observations per day into the global observing networks.  Data from river gages are used in detecting floods, observations from tide gages monitor for tsunamis, fire weather data is used in fighting wild land fires, etc.  GOES DCS is a critical system for NOAA's National Weather Service, NOAA's National Ocean Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the National Interagency Fire Center, the Bureaus of Land Management and Reclamation, states and local municipalities and hydrometeorological services all over the Western Hemisphere.   GOES DCS delivers data into almost every emergency warning system in the U.S. and the neighboring region.  NOAA's ground systems are an essential part of that network.</p>
<p>NOAA's ground systems at the Wallops Command and Data Acquisition Station (WCDAS) in Wallops, Virginia and at the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF) in Suitland, MD are the two main locations for this work to be performed.  The system is comprised of 2 primary systems, the Data Acquisition and Monitoring System - New Technology (DAMS-NT) which takes data  from the satellite to the ground processing system, and the DCS Administration and Data Distribution System (DADDS) which manages system configurations, user and platform information, and distributes data to external users through the Internet and through rebroadcast distribution systems.  These very complex, very large systems have been under development and modernization and under maintenance since 2007.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Assumptions</span></strong></p>
<p>Period of Performance: (FY16-FY20).<br />Locations:  Wallops Command and Data Acquisition Station, VA and NOAA Satellite Operations Facility, Suitland, MD</p>
<p>The support for the GOES DCS includes, but is not limited to, strategic planning, concept development, requirements analysis, system design, engineering, integration/installation, acceptance test and evaluation, integrated logistics support, training and documentation to enhance/improve systems.  The key work areas shall include systems documentation updates, user/operator procedures and training, and System Incident Reports (SIR) response/resolution.</p>
<p>The GOES DCS has a number of elements/subsystems.  The major subsystems are highlighted below:</p>
<p>1.	DCS DEMODULATORS - Receive GOES DCS data from user-owned platforms, add time stamp, data quality into predefined data output structure and transfer data into user output stream for distribution and local data storage.</p>
<p>2.	DCS PILOT / TEST TRANSMITTERS (P/TT) - Transmit a common carrier for the GOES DCS satellite systems transponder and enables operations to selectively poll GOES DCS channels should problems occur throughout the overall system.</p>
<p>3.	DCS PILOT CONTROL MODULES (PCM) - Receives the common pilot carrier and phase locks this signal to normalize the receive frequency within the 400 MHz GOES DCS band.</p>
<p>4.	DCS ADMINISTRATIVE AND DATA DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (DADDS) - The DADDS is the centralized GOES DCS management and data distribution component.  It interfaces to most of the other elements of the GOES DCS, maintains centralized records of the system and enables effective management of GOES resources.  It also enables system users to retrieve data and maintain records on their respective DCP radio sets deployed within the foot prints of the GOES East and GOES West satellites.</p>
<p>6.  	DCS PLATFORM RADIO SET (DCPRS) CERTIFICATION UPGRADES - GOES DCS DCPRS are type accepted for use in the system.  As such, NESDIS must maintain records and conduct type certification of the radio sets operating in the GOES DCS.   Over the past 30 years the GOES DCS has evolved from the legacy 100 bps DCPRS to the present 300/1200 bps equipment.  Presently the 300/1200 bps DCPRS are being updated to accommodate more efficient use of the allocated spectrum.  As this equipment becomes more prevalent in the GOES DCS upgrades will be necessary to the overall GOES DCS to maintain present and future improvements.</p>
<p>Given the evolving nature of the GOES DCS, refresh and upgrade of its components are needed. Work assignments will be written against this potential contract to satisfy the needs to NOAA NESDIS.  The purpose of the work assignments is to refine the system's RF elements, firmware, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software and applications software as required.  The primary focus of this requirement is to update the documentation, operations procedures and training, and to resolve any issues/problems with the GOES DCS.</p>

<DESC><strong>Port Lions Navigational Improvements, Port Lions, Alaska<br />Solicitation #: W911KB-16-R-0007</strong>
<p><strong>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.</strong> The US Army Corps of Engineers is conducting market research to facilitate a determination of acquisition strategy. The determination of acquisition strategy for this acquisition lies solely with the government and will be based on this market research and information available to the government from other sources.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF WORK: This project is for the construction of a new detached rubble mound breakwater at Port Lions, 700 feet in length, located northeast of the existing breakwater. The new breakwater would protect the design fleet from northeast. Additionally, the width of the near-shore opening at the existing breakwater would be reduced to 30 feet by a combination of extending the existing breakwater 40 feet shoreward and by extending the existing stub breakwater 75 feet seaward. The existing mooring basin would remain unchanged. The existing floating breakwater would remain in place. The basin would provide protected moorage for a total of 124 commercial and subsistence vessels ranging in length from 22 to 55 feet. The existing basin depths range from -14 feet MLLW near the entrance channel to -8 feet MLLW at the near-shore extent of the basin. Because the authorized project would not have any significant adverse effects, no mitigation measures (beyond management practices and avoidance) or compensation measures are foreseen at this time.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, Heavy and Other Civil Construction, and the related small business size standard is $37.5 Million. The estimated dollar magnitude of this project is anticipated to be $5 - $10 Million.</p>

The project will provide a comprehensive rehabilitation to the East Shaft Pumping Station. The McMillan WTP is a critical component of the distribution system and so careful consideration has to be given to the phasing of work and critical outages have to be scheduled and met during the low production season. Therefore, an experienced contractor with resources and expertise to handle the following project constraints is needed:</p>
<p>i. The project needs to minimize the number of outages and strictly adhere to McMillan WTP outage criteria so that service interruptions are minimized. <br />ii. Installation of a large submersible pump in an existing building with low headroom. <br />iii. Concrete work, below grade with limited access in a confined space.<br />iv. Replacement of travelling screens using multiple short duration outages.<br />v. Deep trench construction related to an optional bid item to construct a new 24 inch drain line structure is in area of limited equipment access which must account for existing underground utilities nearby.</p>
<p>Interested qualified Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned SB (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZones), or Qualified Section 8(a) certified firms should submit a concise narrative and specific project examples of similar size and scope that demonstrate their experience in:</p>

<DESC>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Fort Worth District (SWF) intends to solicit a brand name only irrigation component per FAR 6.302-1. The Fort Worth District intends to award task order under a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for the expansion and cemetery improvement at DFW. Part of the project includes the installation of irrigation components that will tie into an existing irrigation system at the cemetery. The Fort Worth District intends to sole source brand name Toro sprinkler heads: Toro Mini 8 - (2.0 nozzle) rotor sprinklers (O.A.E.) Toro TR50XT PSS-75 - (7.5 nozzle) rotor sprinklers (O.A.E.) Toro T7PSS-02 - (16.0 nozzle) rotor sprinklers (O.A.E.) Toro TR50XT PSS-30 - (3.0 nozzle) rotor sprinklers (O.A.E.) Toro 570ZPR - pop-up sprinklers (O.A.E.).

<DESC><p>Marine Corps Systems Command has a requirement for Intelligent Power Management (IPM) that was derived from the power generation and distribution Family of Systems (FOS) requirement defined by the U.S. Army Tactical Electric Power (TEP) Capability Production Document (CPD). The IPM capability focuses on providing stable, flexible, reliable and renewable, tactical power.</p>
<p>The overall IPM system consists of three major subsystems: The Mobile Electric Power (Advanced Medium Mobile Power Sources (AMMPS)) with an intelligent Digital Control Systems (DCS); Energy Storage Unit (ESU); Power Distribution with the Marine Corps Mobile Electric Power Distribution System-Replacement (MEPDIS-R). The AMMPS with intelligent DCS allows multiple generators to form a local grid, syncing generators and turning them on and off as needed to automatically adjust to changing load demand. The MEPDIS-R is the current distribution system within Marine Corps and will be the back bone which all other IPM systems must be able to interface with. This RFI is to gather available industry information on potential ESU solutions. Key Traits the Government is interested in for the ESU are:</p>
<p>1. Power Capability: 60kW continuous for 30 minutes Threshold, 60 minutes Objective<br />2. Power Type and Quality: 120/208 VAC 3 Phase, 60 Hz that meets MIL-STD-1332B.<br />3.

Modular system with expandable energy storage capability.<br />5. Autonomous operations that automatically adjust with changing load demand and generation capacity available.<br />6. Environmental Operations: Operates in conditions between 0&#9702;F to 135&#9702;F and be capable of withstanding MIL-STD 810G Environmental tests.<br />7. Life Expectancy: Minimum of 10 year life expectancy.<br />8. ESU shall be capable of battery cycling while under light load and where operating efficiency is high, be capable of switching off.<br />9. ESU shall be capable of providing standalone power when generators are off due to maintenance or tactical necessity.<br />10. The ESU shall detect load transients and exhibit uninterrupted operation while switching between charging and providing power to the load.<br />11. The ESU batteries shall be hot swappable and capable of being removed without interruption to grid power.<br />12. The ESU shall require no changes to the generator set or power distribution system to function.</p>

A TA services contract is needed if there are not enough military support to handle the additional workload. Extensive research specified the types of services that are required in the AF.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These services include: arrival/departure, emergency services, de-icing, towing, tie-down, and maintenance. The Better Buying Power (BBP) 3.0 initiatives target the improvement in the acquisition of services by achieving affordable programs, promoting effective competition, and eliminating unproductive processes and bureaucracy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These goals structure the TA services program and our way forward. We have determined that TA services could support the requirements and opportunities to generate efficiencies in services acquisition. </span></p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The 377th MSG/SC, Kirtland Air Force Base (Albuquerque) NM 87117 requires a bridge contract to succeed contract FA9401-14-C-0016 which expires on 15 March 2016. The bridge contract will consist of a one (1) year basic period of performance with 4, 3-month options. The 377 MSG Contracting Division intends to make an award to Abacus Technology Corporation, 5454 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 1100, Chevy Chase MD 20815. Interested parties may e-mail mary.maestas.1@us.af.mil, not later than 24 November 2015, 3:00 p.m. MST.
<p>All responsible parties may identify their interest and submit a capability statement which will be considered by the government. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Responsible parties must clearly demonstrate in the submitted documents that there will be no service interruptions and no added investment and start-up costs associated with award of a bridge contract to any contractor other than the incumbent contractor. Documentation submitted will not exceed five (5) pages and will be submitted electronically to the cognizant Contracting Officer listed in the first paragraph above. A determination by the government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Award to a new contractor for a bridge contract would impact KAFB's schedules due to the ramp-up time required by a new contractor to support a short period of C4 services. A bridge contract must be executed to ensure that mission critical C4 support remains in place to sustain Kirtland Air Force Base's mission and the various missions of its mission partners. Loss of contract C4 support would have a catastrophic impact on AFNWC and all Kirtland AFB organizations resulting in mission failure and potential negative impacts across the Air Force.</p>
<p>There is only one (1) contractor (Abacus Technology Corporation) who appears to be capable of performing these services on a short-term basis (i.e., bridge contract) with no service interruptions and without added investment and start-up costs.&emsp;</p>

<CONTACT>Kristen Kachur, Phone 9737243217, Email kristen.e.kachur.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of the Joint Project Manager for Medical Countermeasure Systems (JPM-MCS) through the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) is releasing this special notice to inform interested parties about the Government's interest to establish an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) under 10 U.S.C. &sect;845 with an eligible entity or group of entities, to include industry, academic, non-profit, and not-for-profit partners, for advanced development efforts to support the Department of Defense's (DoD) medical pharmaceutical and diagnostic requirements as related to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel. JPM-MCS provides U.S. military forces and the nation safe, effective, and innovative medical solutions to counter Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) threats. JPM-MCS accomplishes this mission through the development of products in four major areas:
<p>- Detection: Systems and devices to identify CBRN agents and assist in making medical decisions <br />- Prevention: Prophylaxis, pretreatment, and post-exposure prophylaxis <br />- Treatment: Therapeutics (post-exposure, post-symptomatic) <br />- Chemical: Medical protection against use of chemical agents</p>
<p>The Government is anticipating establishing a Section 845 Prototype Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) with a consortium that has significant non-traditional contractor participants. The Government in conjunction with a consortium shall perform a coordinated research and development program designed to develop non-traditional opportunities in support of the Joint Program Manager for Medical Countermeasure Systems (JPM-MCS) mission. Under this agreement and associated awards, the Government along with the consortium, shall perform coordinated planning and research and development prototype efforts designed to encompass the following as it relates to support of the Chemical and Biological Defense mission, in the advanced technical areas described below.</p>
<p>JPM-MCS deters or mitigates the use of biological and chemical agents and the means to employ them by providing medical protection to the Warfighter through treatments and prevention. One approach is to develop one-threat-one-drug medical countermeasures (MCMs) for the most catastrophic threats. An example includes the smallpox vaccine to counter a biological threat. A variation on this traditional approach is to use innovative platform technologies that enable rapid development and FDA approval of new MCMs against specific threat agents using approaches analogous to annual influenza vaccines built on a common platform. Another approach is to pursue new technologies for broad-spectrum MCMs or many-threats-one-drug. The current program developing broad-spectrum capability against gram-negative bacteria is an example of this approach, and another is the Bioscavenger prophylactic for protection against chemical nerve agents. JPM-MCS also provides diagnostic devices and technologies to identify and characterize agents for appropriate treatment and other protective measures to improve outcomes against threats, including novel and previously unrecognized, naturally occurring emerging infectious diseases, as well as exposure to radiological and chemical threats:</p>
<p>Medical Countermeasure Technology Objectives:</p>
<p>JPM-MCS is interested in the establishment of a prototype Other Transactions Agreement (OTA), pursuant to &sect;845 of P.L. 103-160 (10 U.S.C. &sect;2371 note), with a consortium that has significant non-traditional defense contractor participants. JPM-MCS intends to use this prototype OTA to collaborate with industry partners for the advanced development of candidate medical countermeasures for chemical and biological defense. JPM-MCS would also like to use this vehicle to partner with the other agencies in the USG and DoD chemical and biological defense enterprise to collaborate with industry on applied research on candidate medical countermeasures and supporting technologies.</p>
<p>The following goals/objectives will be pursued within the execution of this Agreement:<br /><br />(a) Accelerate the development of mission critical technologies in the areas of concern from applied research into advanced development.<br />(b) Deliver therapeutic MCM prototypes targeting viral, bacterial, and biological toxin targets of interest to the DOD. MCM prototypes are drug products that have completed all or part of the activities required to support FDA licensure. This may include meeting warfighter requirements of protection against an aerosolized route of exposure.<br />(c) Deliver enabling technologies that will support the development and regulatory review of MCM prototypes. The enabling technologies can include animal models of viral, bacterial or biological toxin disease and pathogenesis (multiple routes of exposure), assays, diagnostic technologies or other platform technologies applicable to development and regulatory review of MCM.<br />(d) Develop prototype candidates for the prophylaxis, treatment and diagnosis of Chemical threats. This will include diagnosis of, and prophylaxis and treatment for, exposure to traditional and emerging chemical nerve agent threats, as well as other emerging chemical threat agents other than nerve agents.</p>
<p>(e) Develop prototype candidates for the prophylaxis, treatment and diagnosis of Radiological and Nuclear threats. This will include prototype candidates for diagnosis of, and prophylaxis and treatment for Acute Radiation Syndrome.</p>
<p>(f) Develop soldier-carried autoinjector delivery devices for single drug administration. Develop soldier-carried autoinjector delivery devices for administration of two or more drugs.</p>
<p>(g) Develop vaccine-manufacturing platforms that offer early stage manufacturing flexibility and diversity using a deep knowledge of protein(s) expression in a biological system that is reproducible and scalable, and preferably with direct FDA experience. The goal is to manufacture and test identified protective molecule(s) and target molecule(s) (along with associated reagents and standards) in multiple scalable, flexible manufacturing platforms encompassing a diverse array of manufacturing systems (e.g., insect, mammalian, live viral, plant, E.coli, yeast, etc.) for use in appropriate animal model(s) and in Phase 1 trials.</p>
<p>(h) Pharmaceutical development will address the FDA Animal Rule, as appropriate.</p>
<p>(i) Utilize adjuvants and excipients supporting the ability to develop up to 300,000 equivalent doses within 60 days at clinical quality.<br />(j) Support a family of systems diagnostic approach that increases the speed, accuracy, and confidence of agent identification and disease diagnosis. Diagnostic areas include those for organisms that circulate freely and at relatively high numbers at or near the onset of symptoms, organisms that circulate in low numbers early in infection but then integrate with host cells, organisms that have significant genomic diversity from strain to strain, and non-BW agents such as toxins/chemical agents/radiological agents that do not replicate and require low quantities to cause illness.</p>
<p>(k) Support the Critical Reagents Program, the principal DoD resource of high quality, validated, and standardized biological reference materials, reagents, and assays, as necessary.</p>
<p>(l) DoD Advanced Development and Manufacturing Capabilities: The DoD awarded a contract to Nanotherapeutics, Inc. to establish the DoD Advanced Development and Manufacturing (ADM) capabilities. The primary capability will be a BSL-3 capable, multiproduct, cGMP compliant manufacturing facility for biologic products. The ADM, through the prime contractor and teaming partners, will also provide additional product development support, such as clinical research, assay development, small molecule development and manufacturing, and regulatory support, necessary for successful FDA approval/licensure/clearance of medical countermeasures. The facility design employs single use technologies, but will also maintain traditional stainless steel capability. The JPEO-CBD and JPM MCS requires the successful OTA Consortium to include the ADM contractor, Nanotherapeutics, as a member. Further, to facilitate lessons learned and to ensure DoD MCM product development schedules are not impacted, the consortium will consider the ADM contractor for biologics manufacturing activities for monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and recombinant proteins utilize the DoD funded facility. <br />(m) Pursue collaborative research with non-traditional technology providers in a manner that enables effective transition of technologies to Government prototyping programs during any phase of life cycle support (affordability, manufacturability, sustainment, etc.).</p>

This extension will allow the continued the purchase of office supplies for a period of three (3) months with two three (3) month options.  The purpose of this extension is to allow for a continuation in services so the FAA can complete the current competition for a new contract for this requirement.  The FAA is currently in the process of a competition for a new office supplies contract under solicitation number DTFACT-15-R-00003.  

Office Depot is the current provider under contract DTFAWA-10-D-00026. This contract is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under the Strategic Acquisition of Various Equipment (SAVES) Program.  This contract provides simple purchasing of core office supplies, non-core items, Ability One products and UNICOR products for the FAAs CONUS and OCONUS locations.
This is a sole source requirement to Office Depot as they are the only current provider of office supplies under the FAA mandatory source SAVES contract. The follow-on contract for this requirement is currently in the pre-award stages and the proposals received for solicitation DTFACT-15-R-00003 are currently under evaluation. 
The extension to the Office Depot contract will service as a bridge contract consisting of one three (3) month base period and two (2) three (3) month option periods.  The bridge will avoid any interruption in services while the FAA completes the current competition for a follow-on contract.

Accordingly, a competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA is not liable for any costs associated with the preparing of a response to this announcement. Any questions or comments about this announcement must be directed to Elizabeth Ford Ochs at Elizabeth.Ford@faa.gov, no later than 2:00 p.m. EST on November 13, 2015.   All inquiries must be submitted in writing.  Phone calls will not be entertained.

<DESC>The next Base Operation Support Service (BOSS) IDIQ requirement for Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge will be an unrestrictive 8(a) competitive requirement. All qualified 8(a) Business Development (BD) Participants will be eligible to submit an offer. Interested 8(a) contractors will need to have work related experience with 1) Base Operation Support Services (BOSS); 2) Construction Task Order Contracts; and 3) Airfield Operations. A separate Task Order Construction contract would be awarded to the same contractor. Both of these contracts will be awarded with a base year and up to four (4) option years and cover the infrastructure and airfield operations at Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge. Three (3) NAICS codes are applicable to this requirement as follows: NAICS code 561210 - Facility Support Services, NAICS code 488199 - Airfield Operations and NAICS code 238990 - Specialty Trade Contractors. NAICS code 561210 (Facility Support Services) is the main requirement.
<p><br />At this time, we are asking for industry comments from interested 8(a) contractors to be submitted by email to Karl_Lautzenheiser@fws.gov by no later than 3 PM PDT&nbsp;on December 1, 2015. Industry comments received will be consolidated and reviewed to determine whether any edits will be included to the following current Performance Work Statement (PWS) for this requirement:</p>
<p><br />1.0 CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS</p>
<p>1.1 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge and Battle of Midway National Memorial (NWR) is located in the North Central Pacific Ocean at 28 degrees 12 minutes north latitude and 177 degree 22 minutes west longitude. It is about 1,250 miles west-northwest of Honolulu, Hawaii. As a distinct US possession, it is the only land mass in the Hawaiian Island archipelago that is not part of the State of Hawaii. Midway Atoll including all waters to 12nautical miles surrounding the atoll are owned and administered by the U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service). Midway Atoll also lies within the Papah&#257;naumoku&#257;kea Marine National Monument which is administered by three co-trustees - the Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the State of Hawaii. The Service is the agency that has jurisdiction over Midway Atoll. For purposes of this contract, when referring to state and local regulations, the Contractor shall be required to follow state regulations for the state of Hawaii so long as it does not interfere with Federal law. Midway Atoll is home to remarkable wildlife - over 3 million birds of 21 different species and a diversity of other marine life use the atoll and surrounding waters year-round. Midway Atoll is the largest albatross nesting colony in the world with more than 1.3 million individuals of three species visiting November through September each year to lay eggs and raise their chicks to fledging. Midway Atoll also played a notable role in human history from its first settlement in the early 1900's through its many years as a U.S. Navy base. Its significance and the sacrifice of the U.S. soldiers, sailors, Marines and Coast Guardsmen in the final outcome of World War II in the Pacific have been recognized by the additional designation of the Refuge land and water area as the Battle of Midway National Memorial.</p>
<p>Midway Atoll NWR was established in April, 1988 by Cooperative Agreement between the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service). Following its closure under the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990, Midway was transferred to the Department of Interior on October 31, 1996 when President Clinton signed Executive Order 13022.</p>
<p>Today, Midway Atoll NWR functions as one of over 500 National Wildlife Refuges that comprise the National Wildlife Refuge System. Its retention of many of the military facilities that were constructed on the island is not unique within the system, but retention of a fully functional FAA Part 139 certified airport makes it unlike any other refuge. Its location within the Pacific Ocean makes Midway vital to commercial airlines flying twin engine commercial jets across the Pacific Ocean. Those Trans-Pacific jets are required to have emergency landing access to an airport en route, and Henderson Field on Midway Atoll serves that function. The added infrastructure and cost that stem from that requirement are substantial and complex. Midway Atoll is also a fully functioning wildlife refuge with a vital and growing biological program with numerous ongoing, long-term habitat restoration, and species monitoring and research projects.</p>
<p>1.2 ISLAND ACTIVITY</p>
<p>Midway's annual activity may be grouped into three main elements: 1) refuge programs consisting of biological monitoring, habitat restoration, visitor services as funding and support capabilities allow, and Battle of Midway National Memorial commemoration; 2) infrastructure operations and maintenance (including building, structure and historic property construction, rehabilitation, restoration and demolition); and 3) airport capital improvements and operations. Full-time Service employees and volunteers work on the refuge programs throughout the year and the Service hosts a variety of other partner and contracted workers for a variety of programs and projects. Nearly all of the infrastructure maintenance, and airfield operations are conducted by a Base Operations Support Services Contractor (referred to as the BOSS contractor) hired by the Service specifically for those purposes.</p>
<p><br /><br />2.0 PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT</p>
<p>2.1 MOBILIZATION AND TRANSITION/DEMOBILIZATION</p>
<p>2.2.1 The Contractor shall provide an annual management evaluation and assessment report with the same categories and structure as the Quarterly performance report (CDRL B001). This report will provide management trend analysis and recommendations for any systemic improvements for systems/processes (CDRL B002). Contractor format will be acceptable, but it must include categories needed for Service and FAA reports (i.e. US Coast Guard Fuel usage, Refuge Annual Performance Plan, Refuge Management Information, Service's Asset Maintenance Management System, Vehicle Fuel Use Report, Energy Report, Safety Report, Real Property Inventory, etc.). The Service Refuge Manager will verify the BOSS contract Project Manager has included the required information in the Quarterly and Annual Reports.</p>
<p>2.1.1.1 Upon award of the contract, the Contractor shall assume all responsibilities on October 1, 2016 with one (1) month to become fully operational. The contractor will ensure that government property is separated from the contractor's property and that the government property is properly accounted for.</p>
<p>2.1.2 Demobilization shall include all activities and costs for transportation of personnel, equipment and supplies/materials not used in the Contract, including the disassembly, removal and site cleanup of any offices, buildings or other facilities assembled on the site for the Contract.</p>
<p>2.1.3 Work includes mobilization and demobilization required by the Contract at time of award. If additional mobilization or demobilization is required during performance of the Contract as a result of changed, deleted or added items of work, in which the Contractor is entitled to an adjustment in the Contract price, compensation for such costs will be included in the price adjustment for the item or items of work changed or added.</p>
<p>2.1.4 (Delete entire CLIN - placeholder only) Requirement deleted as a result of reduced funding, staffing, and level of required maintenance/service. Reduced maintenance will inevitably lead to reduced facility conditions.</p>
<p>2.1.5 The Contractor is responsible for security of the Contractor's equipment while on site and en route to the site after procurement.</p>
<p>2.2 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>2.2.1 The Contractor shall provide an annual management evaluation and assessment report with the same categories and structure as the Quarterly performance report (CDRL B001). This annual report will provide management trend analysis and recommendations for any systemic improvements for systems/processes (CDRL B002). Contractor format will be acceptable, but it must include categories needed for Service and FAA reports (i.e. US Coast Guard Fuel usage, Refuge Annual Performance Plan, Federal Business Management System Reports, Vehicle Fuel Use Report, Energy Report, Safety Report, Real Property Inventory, etc.). The Service Refuge Manager will verify the BOSS contract Project Manager has included the required information in the Quarterly and Annual Reports.</p>
<p>2.2.2 All equipment necessary for the operational portion of this contract will be furnished by the Government.</p>
<p>2.2.3 Deleted, placeholder only.</p>
<p>2.2.4 Safety Standards<br />The Contractor shall manage and execute all activities included in this Performance Work Statement within the bounds of accepted safety practices and as required by Service Policy and Guidance (FWS 240 FW1 thru FWS 243 FW 5 http://www.fws.gov/policy)<br />The Contractor shall update the Station Safety Plan with all the elements required by 240 FW1 and provide implementation procedures for the safety plan to the Refuge Manager within 60 calendar days after contract award. (CDRL A005)<br />The Contractor shall conduct an annual safety inspection of all Station facilities, operations, and equipment and provide a copy of the report to the Refuge Manager. <br />The Contractor shall comply with the health and safety rules of the Station Safety Plan. <br />The Contractor shall take all reasonable steps and precautions to prevent accidents and preserve the health and safety of Contractor, Government personnel, visitors and wildlife. <br />Any violation of these health and safety rules and requirements, unless promptly corrected as directed by the contracting officer, shall be grounds for termination of this contract in accordance with the Default clause of this contract.</p>
<p>2.2.5 Environmental Compliance<br />The Contractor shall comply with all FWS Policies and Directives pertaining to the Environmental Laws and Regulations (FWS 560 FW 1 thru FWS 561 FW 5 at a minimum). The Contractor shall provide training for contract employees relating to safety, environmental compliance, hazardous material management and fuel spill response in accordance with the FWS Policies and Directives. The Contractor shall adhere to the most updated Midway Atoll NWR Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan (SPCC) (Appendix I) and Facility Response Plan (FRP) (Appendix J). The Contractor shall provide the required inspection forms on a monthly basis and required SPCC training on an annual basis. The Contractor shall keep the Spill notification list in the SPCC and the Emergency Notification list in the FRP. Since the contractor represents the federal government with respect to projects and other activities on Midway Atoll, the contractor is also required to comply with all federal and state regulations and policy pertaining to projects considered to be a "federal action." These include but are not limited to the National Environmental policy Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, The Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act.</p>
<p>2.2.6 Quality Control<br />The Contractor shall develop and implement a quality control (QC) program that provides for adequate control of quality throughout all areas of contract performance. Services under the contract shall be controlled at points necessary to assure complete conformance to contractual requirements. The written procedures developed in compliance with this specification shall be effective, economical, planned, and developed in consonance with overall effort required in contract performance and USFWS Refuge Operations.</p>
<p><br />The Contractors QC (CDRL A002) plan shall be submitted to the Refuge Manager for review in draft format for approval. At a minimum the Contractor will address all utilities, food services, fuel system infrastructure maintenance, vehicle maintenance, vessel maintenance, heavy equipment maintenance, and airfield operations.

<p>The Refuge Manager is the approval authority for all personnel moving to and from Midway, including those requesting travel on Service chartered aircraft or vessels.</p>
<p>2.2.7 Work for Others<br />Request by other agencies for work to be done by the Contractor shall be approved by the Refuge Manager. Reimbursement will be in accordance with the current Midway Fee Schedule. The Service will give consideration to limiting BOSS contractor work for other agencies/contractors during the Midway construction season (approximately August through October) due to high island occupancy and a high volume of BOSS contractor work required when albatrosses are not nesting.</p>
<p>2.2.8 Tracking and Billing of Transient Usage Fees.<br />The Contractor will develop and implement an approved method to account for all fees on a monthly basis, collected from transients to include billeting, food services, guest services fees, port services fees, chartered aircraft transportation fees, equipment rental, labor, recreation fees, and POL.

The Contractor will develop and implement a program to report all Group A, B and C maintenance, including all scheduled or unscheduled routine or emergency maintenance and repairs (Priority 1 through 4 calls and Preventative Maintenance), to the Refuge Manager on a monthly basis at a minimum. This reporting program shall include the disposition of all maintenance activities opened and completed. Completed activities will be removed from the subsequent report. All work performed under this requirement shall conform to industry standards, manufacturers' recommendations and appropriate statutory guidance. Contractor will track property inventory using standard FWS property management system. Repairs and Service Calls will be responded to and completed by the following priority:</p>
<p>Priority Minimum Response Maximum Time to Close the <br />Work Order <br />Emergency, Priority 1 30 minutes 24 hours <br />Urgent, Priority 2 N/A 72 hours <br />Priority, Priority 3 N/A 15calendar days <br />Routine, Priority 4 N/A 30 calendar days</p>
<p>1) Emergency Calls (Priority 1). Situations that require immediate action to eliminate hazards to personnel or wildlife, equipment or environment, prevent loss or damage to Government property, keep the airfield operational, or to restore essential services that have been interrupted by an unplanned event. The Contractor response time to an emergency shall be within thirty (30) minutes following notification of the call for both core and non-core working hours. The Contractor shall stabilize the situation assuring the emergency will not recur. If further labor and material are required to complete the repair once the emergency is arrested, completion and closing of the service call shall be no later than 24 hours following notification of the emergency call unless stated otherwise within the technical portion of this specification.</p>
<p>2) Urgent Calls (Priority 2). Situations that do not immediately endanger personnel/wildlife or threaten to damage property or the environment, but would soon inconvenience and affect the health or well-being of personnel/wildlife or disrupt operational missions or projects. All urgent calls shall be completed and service call closed no later than 72 hours following notification of the call.</p>
<p>3) Priority Calls (Priority 3). Work requiring attention ahead of routine work but does not require immediate response. Completion time for a priority call is usually stated by the requester or a mutually agreed date. A routine service call will be closed when it is completed.. All priority calls shall be completed and service call closed no later than 15 calendar days following notification of the call.</p>
<p>4) Routine Calls (Priority 4). Calls not considered emergency, urgent, or priority call. All routine calls shall be completed and service call closed no later than 30 days following notification of the call, unless specified otherwise when issued. Occasionally, the Refuge Manager shall state specific dates or times for routine service call accomplishment such as providing special maintenance support for other contractors, and other atypical items of work.</p>
<p>Preventive Maintenance (PM) is primarily concerned with items that, if disabled, would interfere with an essential operation, including reliability and availability, endanger life and property, or<br />involve high cost or long lead-time for replacement. PM work includes, but is not limited to,<br />visual and operational inspection, cleaning, corrosion removal and related painting, adjustment, alignments, lubrication and replacement of filters, belts, fasteners, hoses and other consumable items required to correct or minimize operational wear and deterioration of facility systems and equipment.</p>
<p>The Contractor will consult with the Refuge Manager to develop a grounds maintenance plan within the improved areas of the island to be implemented by the Contractor upon final approval by the Refuge Manager. Because of the diversity and abundance of wildlife, the type of maintenance needed will change seasonally. Maintenance will include:</p>
<p>1. A very limited amount of weeding by mechanical means, i.e. weed whacker, (if approved by the Refuge Manager because of endangered nesting Laysan ducks and burrowing seabirds), but no more than four (4) hours per week between August and October<br />2. Weed control by hand or by using approved herbicides as often as required by the plan.<br />3. Pruning of shrubs for aesthetics and to maintain infrastructure free of vegetative damage, but no more than four (4) hours per week<br />4. Trash pick-up and removal, but no more than four (4) hours week and at designated locations.<br />5. Pest control at contracted buildings, but no more than eight (8) hours per week<br />6. Miscellaneous other tasks developed in the plan to maintain safety and a neat appearance. <br />7. Dead bird removal pursuant to the published SOP around the roads, residences, offices and dining facility (note: fire fighters/airfield operations staff will remove "Foreign Object Debris also known as FOD" and dead birds from the runway, taxiway, Runway Safety Area and ramp under CLIN 12).</p>
<p><br />Additionally, the following other areas of grounds maintenance will be limited to no more than four (4) hours per week: washing of walkways/pathways and cement areas before special events and for health and safety; maintenance of landscaped areas, walkways, and parking lots.</p>
<p>2.8 EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE<br />The Contractor shall maintain all equipment, heavy equipment (i.e. dozers, loaders, graders, excavators, dump trucks, flatbed trucks, cranes, etc.), vessels and vehicles. However, priority (Normal Standard) will be placed on emergency/critical equipment, vessels and vehicles such as those supporting the airfield and fuel farm. Non-emergency/critical equipment and vehicles will be maintained as lower priorities (Minimal and/or Preservation Standards). The current equipment listing is located under the annual management report that was incorporated under amendment 0002 that covers the period of October 2009 through September 2010. The equipment will be maintained to either normal, minimal, or preservation levels as directed.</p>
<p>The routine use of motorized vehicles use will only be permitted during work hours/activities. Bicycles will be used for transportation during non-work hours. Motorized vehicles may only be used during non-work hours to transport heavy or bulky items (i.e. transport case of canned goods from the island store to a personal residence). The contractor will ensure that motorized equipment/vehicle use is kept to the absolute minimum even during work hours to conserve fuel and extend the life of the vehicles.</p>
<p><br />1.

<p class="MsoNormal">Responses to the RFI should not exceed 30 pages in length. A complete response to the RFI should include answers to all of the questions below.

Unless stated herein, no additional information is available. Requests for the same will be disregarded. A determination by the Government not to compete this effort is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

Quoters are reminded to include a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 with quotes.
 All clauses shall be
incorporated by reference in the order.

This announcement will close at 8:00a.m. Hawaii Standard time on Friday, December 11, 2015. Questions
shall be submitted to Ms. Thomas via email only at mshindi.thomas@navy.mil no later than 12:00p.m. Hawaii
time Monday, November 30, 2015. 

All responsible sources may submit only one quote via email to mshindi.thomas@navy.mil which shall be considered by the agency.

Procedures in FAR 13.106 are applicable to this procurement. While price will be a significant factor in the
evaluation of offers, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors: price, technical
capability, and past performance. The quoters technical capabilities will be evaluated as follows:
Technical: Quoters must meet or exceed the requirements in the solicitation and any subsequent
amendments.
 The Government will evaluate the Technical Submission, to include the following factors: (a)
technical capability and; (b) past performance, as acceptable or unacceptable. In order to be considered for
award, quoters must receive a rating of acceptable for all factors. The technical capability submission shall
clearly demonstrate the contractors capabilities and expertise in sufficient detail to determine technical
acceptability and should address the following criteria:

**Provide proof of Accreditation from a recognized Regional Accrediting Agency.

**Provide a course syllabus with Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs) for each academic course listed in
paragraph 3.1.1 of the PWS. Each syllabus must provide a detailed description of every week of the five
week course.
** Management/Personnel staffing plan: Demonstrate capability for implementing required services and
providing qualified instructors with professional qualifications, experience and capability to instruct the
necessary curriculum.
 Provide a recruitment plan that includes required qualifications (e.g. education
and experience) for staffing instructors in each field of study listed in paragraph 3.1.1 of the PWS.

Past Performance: The offeror shall submit, as part of its proposal, information on prior experience in providing
educational services on performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the performance work
statement/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for
commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2)
the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the
organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or
Internet) of a contact for each contract listed.
 The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. The
offeror should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state
that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.

Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past
performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably
assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305
(a)(2)(iv)).
 Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of
acceptability/unacceptability, unknown shall be considered acceptable.

Price: For offers which meet technical acceptability, award will be made to the lowest priced offeror.

System for Award Management (SAM). Quoters must be registered in the SAM database to be considered for
award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.sam.gov/.
All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number
if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter
to meet all specifications and requirements.

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The evaluation of quotations shall be on a GO or No-Go basis and will occur in two sequential stages: Technical evaluation determines whether quotations are technically acceptable or unacceptable, followed by a price evaluation. GO: To be technically acceptable, all of the technical requirements as specified in this solicitation are met by the quoter. The technical capability factors are as follows:

Factor 1. Nation-wide Capability 

Standard:  The quoter must provide evidence that it is capable of providing court reporting services on a nation-wide basis with less than a week&rsquo;s notice. The quoter must provide evidence that it has the capability of providing court reporting services in all fifty (50) states, including outside major metropolitan areas.

Factor 2. Time of Delivery 

Standard:  The quoter must provide a written statement indicating that their firm can provide the required court reporting services, and deliver the transcript within the timeframe stated in the RFQ. 

Factor 3. Experience on Similar Contracts 

Standard:  The quoter must provide evidence that it has successfully performed a minimum of three (3) contracts for the same or similar services within the past three (3) years to include contract type, contract number, contract value, point of contact name and telephone number, and the type of service provided. 

NO-GO: An unacceptable quote contains one or more deficiencies. The quote fails to meet specified technical requirements of this RFQ, and not all of the technical requirements are met by the quoter. Once the quotes have been determined to be technically acceptable, award will be based on lowest price. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by the EEOC. Interested quoters are responsible for ensuring that their submitted quote has been received, and is legible.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) seeks to employ a Global Health Security Advisor who will be primarily responsible for ensuring well-coordinated and effective delivery of technical and program support across the Agency's Global Health Security and Development (GHSD) portfolio in Burkina Faso. The portfolio includes priority USG programming for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) preparedness, the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) to prevent, detect,   and respond to infectious disease outbreaks, and USAID's Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) program to pre-empt or combat, at their source, newly emerging diseases of animal origin that could threaten human health. The Advisor will be responsible for overseeing a multi-sectoral, multi&shy;country, complex portfolio, providing leadership and technical support to the full range of GHSD investments as they relate to the designated region. The Advisor will serve as a high-level technical advisor to the USAID Limited Presence Country Office (LPCO) in Burkina Faso which is a unit of the USAID/Senegal Mission. The Advisor will be responsible for working closely with Washington-based AORs to ensure coordination across all assets within the GHSD portfolio and to ensure that program activities are well coordinated with national governments. The Advisor will also liaise with the AORs and CORs of applicable USAID projects in the West Africa region to ensure coordination of GHSA activities and mandated reporting.
<p>Placement of an Advisor in Burkina Faso will fill a critical role for USAID to meet the expectations of the White House and Congress for rapid, effective, and coordinated implementation of GHSA Action Packages.  At the same time, CDC and DOD will be programming significant amounts of their own funds for GHSA activities necessitating effective USG coordination. The Advisor will work closely with other USG partners, particularly the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Department of Defense (DOD) offices working at national levels, which also provide support for GHSA implementation, thus presenting a "whole of government" approach.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. 
If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) as listed on the "Requirements" attachment. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET "HSCG38-16-Q-200029 - REQUIREMENTS" FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS.</p>
<p>Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

SERVICE
Warranty Limited 10 Year Commercial
Lifetime Unclick Locking System Warranty
Construction The Uniclic locking system is milled into all four sides, producing a tight connection that installs quickly. A commercial grade wear layer and M-Force Ceramic Enhanced Urethane finish ensure performance under heavy foot traffic. The adhesive free construction works well over existing flooring and saves time and costs associated with installation.
Urban Patina, These multi-purpose, highly versatile floors offer delightful innovation with never-before-seen visuals in fresh, unique colorways. Urban Patina delivers a bit of mystery: its unusual mix of known species and organic-inspired patterns provide hints of wood without exactly replicating any specific type. Various textures ranging from linear to hand scraped are available in an easy-to-install 7" x 48" size. Hardscape For a more contemporary aesthetic, Hardscape tile products offer a non-directional, limestone visual in a 12" x 24" rectangular format. The result is a modern look that easily accommodates small-scale spaces. Along with Urban Patina, Hardscape is ideal for high-traffic areas in a multitude of segments. Colors shown may vary according to production run.

(Note: As used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)
(a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.
(b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.
(c) 
(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:
(i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and
(ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.
(2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:
(i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and
(ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.
(3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered.

(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering the services under this contract. Complete records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor shall be maintained and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires.
(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all services called for by the contract, to the extent practicable at all times and places during the term of the contract. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.
(d) If the Government performs inspections or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.
(e) If any of the services do not conform with contract requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount. When the defects in services cannot be corrected by reperformance, the Government may --
(1) Require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements; and
(2) Reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.
(f) If the Contractor fails to promptly perform the services again or to take the necessary action to ensure future performance in conformity with contract requirements, the Government may --
(1) By contract or otherwise, perform the services and charge to the Contractor any cost incurred by the Government that is directly related to the performance of such service; or
(2) Terminate the contract for default.
52.228-5 Insurance -- Work on a Government Installation (Jan 1997)
(a) The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain during the entire performance of this contract, at least the kinds and minimum amounts of insurance required in the Schedule or elsewhere in the contract.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under the Act until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under the Act.

(iii) The certification shall state as follows: "I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor."
(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officer's decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in the Act.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractor's specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.
(i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.

Offerors are required only to price the base and four options. Offerors shall not submit a price for the potential one-half year extension of services period.</p>

<p>(b) As part of the quote, offerors must provide three of its most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers in the last three years before the due date for receipt of quotations. One of the past performance references must come from the offeror's Chancellor or Bishop. Relevant contracts include those where the offeror performed services of a similar scope, magnitude, and complexity as those required under this solicitation. Contracts that provide all aspects of the services required by this solicitation will be considered more relevant than those contracts for only portions of the services required. Offerors without relevant past performance information will be assessed a neutral rating for the past performance factor.</p>
<p>(c) The evaluation of past performance will take into account information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the acquisition. In addition, the Government may use past performance information obtained from other than the sources identified by the offeror.

Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.<br />As part of price evaluation, the Government will evaluate its option to extend services (see FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding one-half of the offeror's final option-period price to the offeror's total price. Thus, the offeror's total price for the purpose of evaluation will include the base period, first option, second option, third option, fourth option and extension if needed. Offerors are required only to price the base and four options. Offerors shall not submit a price for the potential one-half year extension of services period.</p>

(Ref FAR 52.217-5) The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

Therefore, each response should be submitted in the most favorable terms satisfying the RFQ requirement.

To permit a through and effective evaluation, the quote should be as concise, complete and clear as possible so as to permit the Government to make evaluation of the quote without further information being required from the quoter. The Government reserves the right to make a determination whether a quote is acceptable or unacceptable solely on the basis of the information submitted and proceed without requesting additional information.

Any resulting additions, deletions or changes to the RFQ will be made by issuances of a formal amendment. Quoters are instructed specifically to contact only the issuing contract office in connection with any aspect of this requirement prior to contract award.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p style="text-align: left; margin: 0in 0in 0.15pt 50.65pt; line-height: 107%;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><br />COMMERCIAL DERIVATIVE AIRCRAFT CAPABILITY ALTERNATIVES<br />Capability Request For Information (CRFI)<br /><br />INTRODUCTION<br />The Air Force is exploring in-production, non-developmental, Government Off-The-Shelf or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (GOTS/COTS) alternatives for a commercial derivative aircraft adapted for military operations. If approved by DoD, the initial need is notionally a "green aircraft" delivery in FY18, subsequent "missionization" by an aircraft mission integrator, followed by an additional 9 aircraft, delivered at a rate of one per year. To assist in this effort, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Aeronautical Systems Development Division<br />(AFLCMC/XZA), Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing this Capability Request for Information (CRFI) to obtain market insight into potential solutions capable of providing at least 10 GOTS/COTS commercial derivative aircraft. In addition to the initial aircraft, sufficient aircraft training and other support (initial spares, support equipment, data, etc.) will be required to operate this aircraft to support a user-command Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY20.<br /><br />Any COTS alternative requires an existing FAA Supplemental Type Certification (STC) and any GOTS alternative requires sufficient airworthiness evidence to enable timely USAF Airworthiness Certification. Meeting schedule is critical and some performance trade-offs will be considered to achieve schedule at an affordable cost. If your solution cannot meet all the USAF desired capabilities, as provided in Attachment 1, describe those capabilities your solution can meet and describe the cost and schedule needed to meet them. If you have more than one commercial derivative solution, please provide a separate response for each. You must describe your solutions' compatibility and comparability to meet the government capabilities listed in Attachment 1, to include rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimates, delivery schedules, and other details requested for potential solutions.<br /><br />This CRFI IS NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this CRFI. This CRFI is part of ongoing Government-conducted, commercial derivative market research for military planning purposes. It is NOT a solicitation. The Government will not provide reimbursement for costs associated with this request. Responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. The submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the US Government and will not be returned. Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government and Contractor personnel hired to provide technical assistance in the Government's preparation of an input to a potential acquisition strategy. All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligation to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contract agreements. The Government has also determined that assisting contractor team members have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of proprietary information. The Government will not reply to information received. The Government may conduct follow-on discussions with responders through individual and/or collective "Industry Day" sessions.<br /><br />PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this CRFI is to: (1) Engage industry early in the effort, (2) Identify sources that can provide a GOTS/COTS aircraft capability and (3) Assist the USAF in ascertaining schedule, cost and technical risk associated with potential procurement of a commercial derivative aircraft for military operations. The information that respondents submit may be used to develop an acquisition strategy. The information in this CRFI is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to any further acquisition actions on the part of the government.<br /><br />RESPONSE GUIDANCE<br />Information received as a result of this request will be considered sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that 'publicly-releasable' and 'proprietary' information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one responder to establish the capability requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition. CRFI responses should include the following components:<br /><br />&bull;1. Cover page containing identification of the company Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, street address, business size for NACICS code 336411 (aircraft manufacturing), names and telephone numbers of the technical Point of Contact (POC) and the overall company POC (in the case of a partnership, please provide appropriate CAGE codes and POC information for the lead company).<br />&bull;2. Responses are limited to 30 pages and must be received by 4 December 2015. Responses must be submitted via e-mail with a CD copy by regular mail in text searchable Portable Document Format (.pdf).<br /><br />All responses should be unclassified. Please send to AFLCMC/XZAB, (Pete Kronbergs, leon.kronbergs.1@us.af.mil) and to the Contracting Officer, AFLCMC/PZITC, (Jonathan Fredrick, jonathan.fredrick.2@us.af.mil), 2275 D Street, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7224.<br /><br />USAF REQUIRED CAPABILITY BACKGROUND<br /><br />A high altitude, extended-range, commercial derivative aircraft is required to meet Air Force needs. Aircraft must be capable of achieving speed/altitude/range minimums as well as the ability to accommodate a mission payload that meets the Size, Weight, and Power / Cooling (SWaP-C) descriptions in Attachment 1.<br /><br />Capabilities to achieve IOC in 2020 include the following:<br />&bull;&bull; COTS production aircraft with an approved Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Type Certificate or Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) or GOTS production aircraft with completed Airworthiness Certification<br />&bull;&bull; One primary "green aircraft" delivered in FY18, plus one set of critical and non-critical spares for each aircraft delivered<br />&bull;&bull; Follow-on production capability for a minimum of 9 additional "green aircraft" (total of 10 aircraft) with delivery to the government at a rate of one aircraft per year beginning in FY19 <br />&bull;&bull; Training initial cadre of pilots and co-pilots (including courseware)<br />&bull;&bull; Implementation of aircraft interim contractor logistics support (CLS)<br />&bull;&bull; One continental United States (CONUS) operating base location with one set of user-verified and published operations and maintenance procedures<br />&bull;&bull; One set of training/courseware material for initial maintenance cadre<br />&bull;&bull; One set of peculiar support equipment<br />RESPONSE DISCUSSION TOPICS<br /><br />Respondents should describe their solution that can best meet the capabilities described in Attachment 1 to achieve the stated IOC. Provide a technical description of the solution to include details of the airframe, subsystems, and costs as requested in Attachments 1 and 2. Assume 600 flight hours annually, for each aircraft, with regard to maintenance, logistics, availability, and training estimates. In addition to the information requested in Attachments 1 and 2, address the following interest areas:<br />&bull;1) Discuss your solutions' current mission(s), users, and delivered quantities.<br />&bull;2) Describe your production rate versus capacity (i.e., excess production capacity).

<DESC><p><br />AN IMPORTANT UPDATE to the previously released SPECIAL NOTICE as of 11/10/15:</p>
<p><br />In an effort to remedy any possible confusion regarding this SPECIAL NOTICE, this requirement will be released through the Consortium for Command, Control, Communications and Computer Technologies (C5). Membership in C5 is required in order to participate in the challenge. For information on the C5 and/or how to become a member, visit the following website: http://c5technologies.org/.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology (ASA(ALT)), Army Cyber Command and Second Army (ARCYBER &amp; 2A), and TRADOC are initiating a Cyber Innovation Challenge to investigate software-based prototype solutions. The intent of the challenge is to evaluate the technical feasibility of a bottom up approach to investigating continuous monitoring and risk scoring, focused initially on developing a risk-based score card capability tool at operational and tactical echelons. <br />As part of the global mission in cyberspace operations, understanding network health and status, as part of larger Cyber SA, and the associated risks generated in the cyberspace domain can be decomposed into functions that rely upon technical elements such as analytics, storage, and visualization. This Cyber Innovation Challenge effort is focused specifically on the commander's ability to visualize the cyber risk posture associated with the networks and assets supporting critical missions. The visualization capability includes, but is not be limited to, various types of data sources such as network topology, friendly asset and open-source information, key-user and threat activity information, and overlays of cyberspace assets on terrain, while supporting interoperability with external mission-command systems. This type of approach allows for the aggregation of information in an Area of Operations (AO) to build a complete risk-based score card that is understandable to decision-makers who are not technically knowledgeable. In order to operate successfully in cyberspace and the electromagnetic spectrum, understanding risk at this echelon must then lead to the implementation of measures that mitigate vulnerabilities and result in a risk-based posture that is acceptable for mission assurance. <br />As previously stated, the Cyber Innovation Challenge is focused on providing commanders and staff elements at the Brigade (BDE) level tailorable and time-relevant information, which facilitates risk-based decision-making. Therefore, the capability must include the ability to understand the cyber posture of the commander's area of responsibility, accounting for all segments of the battlespace (i.e., blue, red and grey). Based on relevance and classification level, the tool must allow for shareable data among the stakeholder community, support analytics on local data stores, and modeling and simulation activities as part of the overall cyber-execution model. The challenge's overarching goal is for the selected awardee(s) to deliver software-based risk-based score card prototype solutions allowing operational evaluation of the capabilities' technical feasibility across various mission areas. This initial aspect of continuous monitoring and risk scoring and supporting solutions must nest within larger, more comprehensive Cyber SA capability; and therefore, any solution offered should be modular to enable integration into all aspects of Cyber SA and Mission Command.<br />An Industry Day is planned for 18 November in the National Capital Region at the MITRE Conference Center which will provide Industry/Academia the opportunity to obtain further details and engage in discussion on Government requirements with the Government sponsors. Additional details and registration information is available at: www.afei.org. The Industry Day will highlight Army requirements and the framework for a follow on Cyber Innovation Challenge event. This Industry Day will serve as an initial opportunity for interested members of industry and academia to meet and discuss details with key Army stakeholders, Army Cyber, TRADOC Cyber Center of Excellence (CoE), ASAALT Program Executive Offices (PEOs). Advance information can be obtained by contacting Mr. Larry Jennings at larry.l.jennings8.ctr@mail.mil.<br />The Army Innovation Challenge and the TRADOC Cyber Quest efforts are complimentary efforts both focused at investigating various aspects of a large requirements space. The Innovation Challenge requirement will be released through an existing consortium community and will utilize Other Transaction Authority (OTA) as the framework, allowing industry to engage with Government. This Industry Day is open to all interested parties across Government, industry, and academia.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposals or Request for Quote, but for planning purposes only. A contract award will not be made from this announcement. The purpose of this announcement is to provide members of industry advanced notification of Government intent.<br />Event Location</p>
<p>MITRE Conference Center<br />MITRE 1 Building (H)<br />7525 Colshire Drive<br />McLean, VA 22102-7539</p>
<p>The Conference Center (South Lobby) is accessed through the back entrance of Building H. <br />Front entrance will not allow access to the event. <br />Parking (free) is allocated there for the event.</p>

<DESC><p>United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) continues its TIE program. Since the program's inception in 2004, ARCIC has conducted over 100 TIE sessions. The TIE program brings industry/corporate/company representatives together with the TRADOC, ARCIC, Research, Development and Engineering Command, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, other Army S&amp;T Organizations, and TRADOC Centers of Excellence (CoE) for a dialogue on emerging technologies that could support Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFCs) http://www.arcic.army.mil/Initiatives/army-warfighting-challenges.aspx. Organizations that participate in TIEs do not receive any financial reimbursement for this participation from the U.S. Army.<br /><br />The TIE program is voluntary and is intended to foster the free flow of information related to the Research and Development (R&amp;D) efforts of private industry, to the benefit of the U.S. Army. Participation in the TIE program is open to all interested members of industry, but due to time and resource constraints, requests to participate are evaluated based on the projects/programs ability to address the needs of the Warfighter. Each TIE session provides a forum allowing an individual member of industry to share proprietary information on its long-range Research and Development efforts (outside the presence of competing industry members) with U.S. Army officials knowledgeable on the general subject matter of AWFCs best aligned with the private R&amp;D effort. The sessions are executive level meetings chaired by an Army Flag Officer or equivalent.<br /><br />The intent is to provide feedback to help industry focus their R&amp;D programs (without any financial reimbursement) toward existing and future Army capabilities, which will benefit both industry and the U.S. Army.<br /><br />This is a Request for Information in accordance with FAR 15.201(b). THIS I NOT A SOLICITATION. RFIs are used to gather information from industry without any promise of a current or future contract or requirement. The ARCIC will use the responses to this RFI to determine what emerging technologies may be available in the market place. This is not a solicitation for bids or offers. Information provided cannot be used to create a binding contract. Respondents to this RFI will not be reimbursed for the information they provide to the ARCIC. This is a RFI from companies already conducting independent research and development in relevant areas, not a request for companies that may be able to conduct research. Only those companies with demonstrated success at addressing Department of Defense warfighting capabilities in their independent R&amp;D programs are requested to respond.<br /><br />The Army will emphasize long range planning to define future decision point that consider equipment age, degradation of overmatch abilities, industrial base viability and closure of capability gaps in the near term (FYs 16 -20), mid-term (FYs 21-30) and long term (FYs 30-50) time frames, while allowing for cost-informed decisions that balance force generation needs for Force 2025 and Beyond. The AWFCs should be used when responding to this RFI to help focus TIE discussion topics. When responding, please provide the following: a brief description and depth of the company independent R&amp;D program; a one-page summary of past R&amp;D success satisfying DOD capability needs; a one-to-two page description of each of the R&amp;D programs/projects that apply directly to AWFCs and, points of contact for further coordination if necessary. Contact the TIE Coordinator listed below, who will provide format for topic submission. Based on the information provided, your company may be selected to participate in an ARCIC-hosted TIE sessions to provide capabilities briefings, highlighting developed or emerging technology.<br /><br />IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Forward responses to: Mr. O'Keefe, TIE Coordinator. Address: TRADOC ARCIC Science &amp; Technology Division (ATFC-ET) Concept Development and Learning Directorate, 950 Jefferson Ave, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, VA 23604-5763, Telephone: (757 501-5527 Email: usarmy.jble.arcic-cdld.mbx.tie-coordinator@mail.mil.<br />For calendar year FY16, Interested companies are requested to notify the TIE Coordinator of their participation intent by 31 January 2016.<br /><br />COMPANIES SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER PLACING INFORMATION ABOUT INDEPENDENT RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT (IR&amp;D) PROJECTS FOR ARCIC AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES to review and consider at http://www.defenseinnovationmarketplace.mil/.

Additionally, there is no Miramar CDRL A007 CIS KC-130 Performance Summary for SEP 15 as there was minimal data during its Mobilization period.

<DESC><strong>Solicitation 7PQC-FW-15-10001/GS-07P-15-UA-C-0010 is hereby canceled in its entirety.</strong><br /><br />The General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service is seeking a construction contractor to furnish all labor, tools, materials, equipment, supplies and supervision to replace the cooling towers system servicing the George H W Bush and George W. Bush US Courthouse and George Mahon Federal Building, at 200 E Wall Street, Midland, TX. The overall intent is to replace the two existing cooling towers with new 210 ton cooling towers in order to meet the current demand. The new cooling towers shall be of 316 stainless steel (or fiberglass) cooling towers featuring resistance to corrosion. New pumps are to match the cooling towers capacities. <br />The work includes installation of new automatic air vents at the high points of the heating and cooling water systems in each mechanical room, install suction diffusers for the hot water pumps, and replace the pneumatic expansion tanks in the penthouse with bladder type pressure tanks.
<p>The magnitude for this project is between $250,000 and $500,000. The firm must be a General Construction firm under NAICS: 238220, size standard: $15 million. It is anticipated that this project will take approximately 150 calendar days from notice to proceed. Award of any resulting contract will be based on the lowest price technically acceptable methodology. The offeror shall obtain any and all necessary licenses or permits required to perform this work in the State of Texas. The project will require work to be performed within an occupied Federal Building while minimizing disruptions to the operations of the existing facility.</p>
<p>This is a SERVICE-DISABLE VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. The procurement is subject to availability of funds.</p>
<p>The solicitation issue date will be on or about July 15, 2015. This solicitation will be restricted to Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms.

<DESC><p><strong>November 10, 2015<br /><br />The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate a "Key Changes" document that outlines the changes made from PGDS version 4.2 to 5.0.</strong><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />August 25, 2015</p>
<p>TSA is issuing the revised Planning Guidelines and Design Standards for Checked Baggage Inspection Systems (PGDS) Version 5.0.</p>
<p>The design principles and methods in the PGDS incorporate the insights and experience of TSA and industry stakeholders, including airport and airline representatives, planners, architects, baggage handling system designers, and equipment manufacturers. The PGDS is intended to assist planners and designers in developing cost-effective solutions, and to convey the TSA's requirements for checked baggage inspection systems. The PGDS emphasizes the best practices that are associated with baggage screening system layouts and addresses other factors necessary to actively manage system costs and performance.</p>
<p>Based on feedback from the industry, the PGDS has now been formatted to differentiate requirements from best practices with a focus on system performance. Requirements tables can now be found at the beginning of each chapter and the statements themselves have been underlined in the text.</p>
<p>The TSA welcomes comments to the PGDS Version 5.0 from industry stakeholders and will continue to coordinate with the aviation industry to periodically update the PGDS. Comments and suggestions should be sent to pgds@tsa.dhs.gov.</p>
<p>Additional guidance for making comments is provided in Appendix A of the PGDS.</p>
<p>***This post is to provide awareness to industry about the latest release of the PGDS. Please do not provide any submissions or e-mails to the TSA Point of Contact listed in this Special Notice. Any comments should be directed to PGDS@tsa.dhs.gov.***</p>

<DESC>VA Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor Next Generation (MSPV-NG) Program
Industry Questions 
November 4, 2015

1.  What are the VA's strategic goals and intended contract outcomes of standardization?
Response:  Standardization to the maximum extent possible the types and kinds of supplies and equipment purchased, consistent with clinical and practitioner needs, facilitating best-value product pricing through committed volume purchasing, and facilitating the delivery of high-quality health care. 

2. What is the role of clinicians in the standardization process?
Response:  It is important to note the MSPV Cataloging process consists of a traditional VHA Standardization effort, and a streamlined process that is based on a continuous open solicitation.  In the standardization process, committees of clinicians led by a project manager are selected for their area of expertise will identify, evaluate and recommend candidate items for standardization.

3. If the FSS program faces diminished participations and if there is an increase in direct purchases, what are the VA's thoughts on using this as an opportunity to pivot towards a more market based model?
Response:  The MSPV-NG process will offer VHA facilities the supplies that are currently being purchased and used to provide medical care to our Veterans.  These supplies will be procured through the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and open market purchases, both of which will be distributed through the MSPV-NG Prime Vendor.

4.  What are the VA's thoughts on using this as an opportunity to pivot towards a more market based model?
Response:  The MSPV-NG process will offer VHA facilities the consumable commodities and supplies that are currently being purchased and used to provide medical care to our Veterans.  These supplies will be which are procured through the FSS and open market purchases, both of which will be distributed available through the MSPV-NG Prime Vendor.  

5. Regarding the recent BPA and certain aspects of the program: What methods are being used to determine the "salient characteristics" for MSPV BPA?
Response:  Because of the number of items in the "most purchased" list (4,869) and due to the limited time allocated for product development process by which all line items must be sent to SAC for contract award by January 30, 2016 in order to complete the MSPV-NG catalog by April 20, 2016, a standing Integrated Product Team (IPT) of medical/surgical/clinical subject matter experts (SMEs) is not available to create product descriptions during the product requirement development process.  In lieu of these personnel, the Procurement and Logistics Organization (P&LO) Program Executive Office Project Managers will use their professional judgement and familiarity with their clinical programs to base the development of the "salient characteristics"/product descriptions upon commercial specifications of the commodities on the "most purchased items" list.

6. VA-SAC is approaching this initiative on an individual item basis instead of at the product category level. Award decisions are being made on a line item basis instead of for an entire product category.  Commercial groups and the DOD approach product standardization at the product category level because this is the best way to receive value from manufacturers/vendors.  Will VA-SAC consider changing their approach and issue solicitations for entire product categories instead of for individual product codes?  
Response:  Concur that duplications have been occurring.  This discrepancy was recently identified by one of our other industry partners and we are working with the Program Office to try and come up with a suitable remedy in this matter.  In the interim, when duplication is identified we are reviewing the two buys to determine the best course of action, for instance cancellation of one of the items.  The final decision is based on the needs of the Government.    

7. What is the relationship of PV's to the VA? Are they "agents" or independent contractors? This is important for definitions as it relates to IFF, commercial pricing and FSS.  
Response:  The BPA are written against the FSS; and therefore, must comply with the FSS. 

8. How will VA monitor compliance with PV?  Asked this question to VA last week and never received a response.  
Response: VHA monitors VISN MSPV spend as a percentage of overall Med/Surg spend monthly using internal VHA financial data.  The current goal is for the MSPV to be 40% of all Med/Surg spend.  VISNs not meeting goal are required to provide VHA P&LO with an action plan with monthly updates until they're in goal.
9. If PV is mandatory is price the only factor considered for award?  
Response: Regarding awards to the MSPV-NG catalog, price and technically acceptable are the criteria to determine award.  

10. What happens to physician's preference under PV?  
Response:  The MSPV-NG process provides the VHA facilities the consumable commodities and supplies that are currently being purchased and used to provide service to our Veterans. These supplies which are procured through the FSS and open market purchases will be available through the MSPV-NG Prime Vendor.  If a physician desires a supply item that is not available through the prime vendor, the medical facility may procure that item on the open market and apply for a waiver if a procurement waiver is necessary.

Government purchase card impact: 
11. As manufacturers lose access to prime vendor program, purchase card use will likely increase dramatically.   
Response:  VA is moving away from credit card purchases to ordering using competed vehicles under prime vendor.   We anticipate a period of transition to identify and establish BPA's for those items that are used by the facilities.

Impact to the FSS Program: 
12. A primary reason many med-surg manufacturers maintain an FSS is to secure product access through the PV program. Without that access, may see dramatic reductions in FSS contracts and migration to an open market direct selling model to VA.  
Response:  It's the Government's intent to maximize those items included in the MSPV catalog.  This model facilitates streamlining, economy of scale, and accessibility to needed products enterprise-wide.  This model meets VA's needs; any adverse effect outside VA is unintentional. 

13. Standardizing by individual line item product codes, as opposed to product categories, is not a standard practice by health care system material management and will likely lead to significant confusion at the clinical level (examples, multiple suture vendor products, disposable products that connect to specific equipment and is not interchangeable, products that have proven superior clinical outcomes, etc.).  What is the rationale for the SAC's decision to standardize by product line item rather than by category?  
Response: The current MSPV acquisition process is designed to get on national level contract or BPA the consumable commodities and supplies that the facilities are currently procuring through FSS, local purchase orders or purchase cards. It is not a standardization program.

14. Will solicitations over $25,000 be posted to FedBizOps along with the award?
Response:  The SAC is currently soliciting MSPV cataloging utilizing two separate procurement processes.  The first process is for the acquisition of items/products in accordance with FAR SubPart 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules through the GSA's e-Buy system.  In accordance with FSS procedures, RFQs for items solicited under the FSS program will posted on e-Buy; however, these items are not subject for further posting under FedBizOps.   

Under the second process, which entails the processing of items not found on FSS; these items (Non-FSS) will be posted in accordance with FBO.
15. Will VA-SAC consider publishing a listing of awarded CLIN(s) from each RFQ and Amendment issued so that vendors can see the successful bidders?  Will this include a Summary of Award by line item?  
Response: Yes, the VA will post a listing of awarded CLIN(s) to e-Buy on a monthly basis.   This will include a summary of awards by line item. 

16. Can the VA SAC please address how line item bidding and category bidding will be aligned?
Response:  The cataloging development is an evolutionary process that will improve over time.  It involves solicitation for VHA Standardization requirements, as well as the solicitation for MSPV Cataloging items on an open continuous standardization efforts and the MSPV Cataloging efforts. 

17. How do we manage line item bids for a surgical item when a posting for that surgical item category standardization occurred separately?
Response:  It sounds like what is being described is duplication within the acquisition processes.  This discrepancy was recently identified by one of our other industry partners and we are working with the Program Office to try and come up with a suitable remedy in this matter.  In the interim, when duplication is identified we are reviewing the two buys to determine the best course of action, for instance cancellation of one of the items.  Please provide, in writing, these discrepancies in solicitation questions so that we can address them.   

18.  Is the VA SAC aware when this process is done by line item, 48-60 person hours per line item BPA is required by one manufacturer's estimate?
Response:  The VHA Program Management Office develops each requirement from historical data in the Medical Products Database.  The MSPV Catalog will be based on aggregate needs, some high volume, and some low volume.  The capability to facilitate smaller requirements may vary from prospective offeror to prospective offeror, therefore the decision to quote or not quote will be a business decision based on capability and level of risk absorption.  The SAC tried to make the proposal process as easy as possible so that vendors could respond to the RFQ without a large investment in the bid process.    We are also relooking at the solicitations to see if we can identify further streamlining opportunities to continue to make it an easier process; we invite industries thoughts on this as well.  Also making this a mandatory use item should increase the usage by the VA.
19. When questions or clarifications are needed for a bid response will the CO respond to email and/or phone requests due to the sensitivity for timeline and deadlines for the bid?
Response:  Yes; in writing.  Responses will be provided within 3 business days or less.  However, in cases whether the SAC has to reach out to the customer (PMO) for a response, the process could take up to five business days.  

20. How is market research being done for line items and/or product categories?  
Response:  Market Research is currently being conducted at two levels utilizing an array of different techniques.  The first level is at the Program Office, where the items/products are researched based on historical usage.  From this research, the Program Office gathers information relating to manufacturers of the items, and associated part numbers; historical prices/cost of the items; units of issue; and appropriate salient characteristics, and/or, product descriptions.  Once assembled, the information is submitted to the SAC to begin the acquisition process.

Upon receipt of the document(s) from the Program Office, the SAC validates the data received and conducts additional market research efforts in accordance with FAR 10.002, to include inquiries of the VetBiz VIP database; internal agency excess stock, and the VA's Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) database.  Each research effort is geared at collecting and analyzing information about capabilities within the market to satisfy the agency's needs. 

If deemed necessary the Contracting Officer can conduct additional market research.  The additional market research consists of, but is not limited to: Conducting Webinars which are designed to get information out to a large number of industry suppliers in an expedient manner; conducting 'Industry Days', which are designed to encourage an interactive mode of communication between the Government and industry; reviewing the results of recently solicited RFQ and conducting a comparison of past historical purchases when there is a shortage of bids received; and querying other Government and Industry databases.       

21. VA-SAC is only notifying our company when we have been awarded a BPA for a particular RFQ CLIN.  Will VA-SAC publish a listing of awarded CLIN(s) from each RFQ and Amendment issued so that all vendors who responded will know who the successful bidder was?  If so, will this listing include a "Summary of Award" by line item as required by the FAR? 
Response: Yes, the VA will post a listing of awarded CLIN(s) on GSA eBuy on an on-going basis (for FSS awards only).  Non-FSS awards will be published on FBO on an on-going basis.  At this time a summary of awards might not seem like a summary since we get the requirements often individually.  Once a grouping has been determined, a summary will be a lot easier to provide.

22. Is the VA SAC aware when this process is done by line item, 48-60 person hours per line item BPA is required by one manufacturer's estimate?  
Response:  We want to group these items but up until now, this has been difficult.  Our intention is for industry to spend a couple of hours proposing on each line item.  What do we need to do to make this better for industry to propose and not spend a lot of effort.  Thanks.

23. When questions or clarifications are needed for a bid response will the CO respond to email and/or phone requests due to the sensitivity for timeline and deadlines for the bid?
Response:  It is the SAC's intent to respond to questions, in writing, within 3 business days, or less.  However, in cases whether the SAC has to reach out to the customer (PMO) for a response, the process could take up to five business days.


24. How is market research being done for line items and/or product categories? 
SAC Response:  Market Research is currently being conducted at three levels utilizing an array of different techniques.  The first level is at the Program Office, where the items/products are researched based on historical usage by the VA Medical Centers.  From this research, the Program Office gathers information relating to manufacturers of the items, and associated part numbers; historical prices/cost of the items; units of issue; and appropriate salient characteristics, and/or, product descriptions.  Once assembled, the information is submitted to the SAC to begin the acquisition process.

Upon receipt of the document(s) from the Program Office, the SAC validates the data received and conducts additional market research efforts in accordance with FAR SubPart 10.002, to include inquiries of the VetBiz VIP database; internal agency excess stock, and the VA's Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) database.  Each research effort is geared at collecting and analyzing information about capabilities within the market to satisfy the agency's needs.  

Based upon the market research, SAC's Contracting Team determines the most suitable approach to acquiring, distributing, and supplying the items under the acquisition.  In addition, if deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, additional research is conducted by the Contracting Specialist working the acquisition.  The additional research consists of, but is not limited to:  Conducting Webinars which are designed to get information out to a large number of industry suppliers in an expedient manner; conducting 'Industry Days', which are designed to encourage an interactive mode of communication between the Government and industry; reviewing the results of recently solicited RFQ and conducting a comparison of past historical purchases when there is a shortage of bids received; and querying other Government and Industry databases.       

26. VA-SAC is only notifying our company when we have been awarded a BPA for a particular RFQ CLIN.  Will VA-SAC publish a listing of awarded CLIN(s) from each RFQ and Amendment issued so that all vendors who responded will know who the successful bidder was?  If so, will this listing include a "Summary of Award" by line item as required by the FAR? 
Response:  FSS MSPV Catalog awarded CLIN(s) will be published under the NAC Contract Management (CM) database.  Non-FSS MSPV Catalog actions will be posted in accordance with FAR and other Agency guidance.  

27. A significant amount of "duplication" is occurring in SAC RFQ's, meaning that the same item or same item description has been included in multiple solicitations.  SAC has made awards for items that have already been included on a previous BPA award in some cases.  It appears that SAC contract specialists do not communicate with each other and that no one is keeping track of the specific types of items that are being solicited and awarded on BPA's. 
Response:  It sounds like what is being described is duplication within the acquisition processes.  This discrepancy was recently identified by one of our other industry partners and we are working with the Program Office to try and come up with a suitable remedy in this matter.  In the interim, when duplication is identified we are reviewing the two buys to determine the best course of action, for instance cancellation of one of the items.  Please identify these duplications in writing to the Contracting Officer in the solicitation so we can address them.

28. Please address the overall changes within the OAO - direction & any immediate changes that would impact manufacturer vendors.
Response:  The only overall change in OAO is that SAC is assuming the strategic medical BPAs from the NAC.  Otherwise, the SAC is not able to gather a clear assessment of what is being requested under this concern.  Request further clarification as to the specific concern under this area.

29. Regarding the open national BPA contracts, when will the process begin and what would be the typical timing from issuance of sources sought notice to contract award.  For example, the standard manual wheelchair sources sought notice went out months ago, but the solicitation is still pending.  (We are anticipating contracts for items such as electric lifts, standard manual wheelchairs and walkers.)  
Response:  SAC is working with the Program Office/Prosthetic POCs to mitigate any lapse in contract coverage.  Vendors are encouraged to continue to monitor FBO and/or GSA eBuy for any subsequent information.
30. Please address the relationship/impact of the MSPV program on the Federal Supply Schedule program.  How does the order process differ between the two programs? What are expectations in terms of pricing? Is it true that in order to qualify to submit products for national contracts, the products must currently be on a FSS? 
Response: The relationship/impact of the MSPV program on the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program.  In accordance with FAR SubPart 8.4, and VAAR 8.002, items procured under the FSS will be prioritized and awarded to FSS Schedule Holders under a competitive environment.  There is no change.  

Order process difference between the two programs
Ordering will be conducted in accordance with established guidelines.  This process will be further addressed under the MSPV-NG Contract and the accompanying 'Ordering Guide', which is still under development at this time.

Expectations in terms of pricing
There are two separate ongoing actions under the MSPV Program, the acquisition of the MSPV-NG Distribution Contract, and the establishment of BPAs, which are currently being established with prospective Suppliers to populate the MSPV Catalog.  The MSPV Catalog will become the cornerstone for items available under the MSPV-NG Program.  Pricing is addressed under each MSPV action, Distribution and Cataloging, separately.  As the MSPV-NG Distribution is currently under active evaluations, no discussions under this topic will be addressed under this response.  Regarding the MSPV Cataloging effort, pricing will be sought with perspective Suppliers with the expectation of obtaining best price quotes through a competitive environment.  Additional information regarding this topic can be found under each of the MSPV Cataloging Solicitation, which can be found on e-Buy.

31. Is it true that in order to qualify to submit products for national contracts, the products must be on a FSS?
Response:  There are two parts to this response.  Yes for FSS.  In order to be considered for award of a BPA under the MSPV Cataloging FSS Program, the Schedule Holder, as well as the Schedule Holder's Product(s) must be included under the VA- FSS Program.  However, MSPV-NG also allows for the award of Non-FSS items where they are not on the FSS schedule. 

32. How long will/should it take to process product additions to FSS contracts? 
Response:  From recent conversation with the VA's National Acquisition Center, it is anticipated that this process could take from six to nine months.  
33. Can the VA address lead time and any improvements to responding to mods, etc.?  
Response:  Lead times vary depending on the type of procurement action, and anticipated lead times can range anywhere from 60 calendar days to 260 days.  The SAC intends to accelerate the time it takes to award and that is why we are soliciting the way we are currently.
34. Does the VA currently have the capability/resources to measure best value vs lowest price for complex medical devices for sole source awards? 
Response:  The high tech medical procurement program is coordinated through the NAC and is not anticipated to be part of MSPV.  If an item is determined to be sole source, we will solicit it as such.
35. How is market research conducted for the MSPV program given the regions set-aside for small businesses?  
Response:  Market research is conducted in accordance with FAR and Agency guidelines.  The MSPV Distribution set-asides are completely different than the MSPV medical Supplies BPAs.  FSS medical supplies will be solicited full and open and Non-FSS medical supplies are applicable under Part 19.  When identified, will be solicited as SB set-aside for manufacturers and then cascading.
36. How will new technologies be introduced into VA with PV? 
Response: New items will be added to the MSPV Catalog provided they are included in VA FSS 65 and 66 or solicited though open market.  These requirements are determined by the VHA Program Management Office as necessary for inclusion.  

37. Will BPA's for products to be distributed by PV be single or multiple awards?  If single how will VA account for surge and out of stock items?  
Response:  Medical products will be distributed on a single-award basis, in order to facilitate ease of use by a VA Ordering Officer.  If there is a surge resulting in an item out of stock, the CO will approve a substitution.  

38. Last week VA talked about establishing an "Amazon" like experience.  Would the VA consider providing it through GSA Advantage?  
Response:  In the short term, each MSPV will have its own web-based catalog ordering system using the same MSPV product catalog.  The long-term goal is to have one Government ordering portal to purchase supplies through MSPV.

39. What will happen in the interim if BPAs are not in place when the PV contract is awarded?  
Response:  We understand that additional items will need to be added to the catalog based on end user needs, and as those items are identified, we will be establishing BPAs.
General Industry Concerns:

Need to recognize the value of FSS pricing: 
40. The VA needs to recognize that FSS pricing is excellent considering for most manufacturers they represent around 1% of the US health care sales for a manufacturer.  
Response:  Significant pricing discounts can be obtained by competition among Federal Supply Schedule holders in accordance with the FAR.  

New technology impact: 
41. New products will be delayed in reaching veterans and clinicians as a BPA would need to be established for PV access.  
Response:  No.  Procurements can still be handled in accordance with the FAR to ensure there is no delay in the care of our Veterans.

Product backorders and recalls: 
42. Sole sourcing results in a customer being vulnerable to product backorders and recalls.  
Response:  MSPV cataloging efforts for FSS items are being conducted in e-Buy on competitive basis.

Increase in Protests:
43. Award protests likely to increase when national level sole source BPAs are awarded.  
Response:  Noted by VA.

Impacts on Competition:  
44. Businesses and manufacturers may choose to "No Bid" many new BPA categories as there is an inverse relationship to the amount of time and money to respond to a BPA (monitor compliance, submit quarterly reports, etc.) compared to the small amount of business generated by volumes projected in many categories. Some BPAs currently being posted by the SAC are below $10,000 in value.  
Response:  Noted by VA.  The VHA Program Management Office develops each requirement from historical data in the Medical Products Database.  The MSPV Catalog will be based on aggregate needs, some high volume, and some low volume.  The capability to facilitate smaller requirements may vary from prospective offeror to prospective offeror, therefore the decision to quote or not quote will be a business decision based on capability and level of risk absorption.   The SAC tried to make the bid process as easy as possible so that vendors could respond to the RFQ without a large investment in the bid process.  Also making this a mandatory use item should increase the usage by the VA.

NEXT GENERATION MSPV (NG-MSPV) CATALOG:
45. While some products can be considered interchangeable commodities, a large number of medical products currently procured from the MSPV are complex medical devices that have variations in clinical outcomes and FDS approvals.  Only standardizing to one product in federal agencies usually values little other than price and rarely understands complex medical devices or impact on patient outcomes.  Will there be a robust clinical involvement and thorough analysis to capture these clinical nuances which may not be captured by procurement staff that may not have experience with medical products?  Will "best value" be considered versus LPTA?  How are "Salient Characteristics" determined?  We've seen many BPA's that have incorrect product numbers and descriptions and "salient characteristics" that do not match the product number and/or descriptions which is very confusing and is forcing a "No bid" as cannot get clarification from the SAC when requested via emails.
Response:  The acquisition for complex medical devices will not be part of the MSPV.   In regards to incorrect product numbers, descriptions and "salient characteristics" the SAC is working with the Program Office to try and come up with a suitable remedy in this matter.  SAC will attempt to respond to all inquiries within 3 business days; however, depending on the complexity of the matter, the response could take longer.   Please continue to identify discrepancies to the Contracting Officer so that the matters can be resolved.
46. Reducing access from approximately 430,000 MSPV line items to 6,000 will reduce timely access to most products to VAMC's, increasing contracting workloads, increasing inventory levels to protect against product outages, increasing Purchase Card use and could potentially lose the basic business value of the Prime Vendor program.  How will the SAC address these potential unanticipated outcomes and, more importantly, how will the remaining 420,000+ product items be procured if they are not available through the MSPV?  
Response:  In addition to establishing and continually updating and adding to the MSPV Catalog, we are reducing the number of suppliers that provide the same items through standardization, but open market and other non-MSPV purchases are still available.  VA is also moving away from credit card purchases to ordering using competed vehicles under prime vendor.  We anticipate a period of transition to identify and establish BPA's for those items that are used by the facilities.

47. There are significant costs to VA and industry by sole sourcing to individual product line item as BPA's have compliance monitoring, quarterly reporting, etc. and many of the line item BPA's being posted have very low yearly dollar values, some less than $10,000.  Many manufacturers may "opt-out" and strategically elect no to participate due to management costs and inefficiencies.  How will the SAC re-evaluate line item BPA sourcing and consider product category sourcing?
Response:  The VHA Program Management Office develops each requirement from historical data in the Medical Products Database.  The MSPV Catalog will be based on aggregate needs, some high volume, and some low volume.  The capability to facilitate smaller requirements may vary from perspective offeror to perspective offeror, therefore the decision to quote or not quote will be a business decision based on capability and level of risk absorption.  The SAC tried to make the quote process as easy as possible so that vendors could respond to the RFQ without a large investment in the bid process.  Also making this a mandatory use item should increase the usage by the VA.
NG-MSPV BPA:
48. Can you please clarify if the MSPV BPA pricing will only be available to VA facilities (as is the current practice) or to all federal government facilities?  If all federal government facilities, could you please provide a complete listing of who can purchase from this contract?
Response:  Yes, Other Government agencies will be allowed to utilize the MSPV Contract.  Currently Indian Health Services and Bureau of Prisons have been identified.

49. The current VA NG-MSPV solicitation has the BPA reporting forms and Appendix C requiring more details than our company, as a manufacturer,  can provide ie purchase order number, work order, etc. and the 30 day timing vs the standard 60 day timing for IFF payment and BPAs today.  Attachment E says "Monthly Reporting Tool" and Section K refers to submitting quarterly report of sales.  Please clarify that quarterly reports not monthly reports are requested.  The FSS contract requirement for payment of IFF is 60 days after calendar quarter close.  The BPA information would not be available within 30 days given the prime vendor and chargebacks.  How can quarterly report of sales not later than thirty (30) calendar days be required when the FSS requirement is 60 days?
Response:  Appendix C data is required for product identification to add items to the MSPV Catalog, and is not a monthly or quarterly reporting tool. Regarding monthly versus quarterly reporting, quarterly reporting is required.  As for the 30 versus 60 days at the end of the quarter, we will amend the current solicitations to coincide with the 60 day FSS requirement.  

50. The form in "Attachment E - BPA Monthly Reporting Tool" looks like it was developed assuming that the BPA awardee sells directly to VA facilities as detail is required for each individual order, such as the fields for PO number, task order/delivery order number.  As a manufacturer selling through the VA Prime Vendors, we do not have visibility of this specific order information (i.e. task order/delivery order number and PO number) when Prime Vendors submit rebate claims to our company.  However, on the BPA awards that we currently hold with the VA, we do provide quarterly purchase volume information to the NAC on the NAC reporting tool.  Would that information be sufficient for these BPA's?  
Response:  No, reporting on the NAC tool will not be sufficient if awarded a BPA, and we will expect an attachment E, Quarterly Report.  However, as stated above we will amend the 60 days report submission.  The reporting format for MSPV-NG is included in each solicitation.
