<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the provision of Program Management and Integration Capability (PMIC).
<p>The goal of the contract is to engage an industrial partner who will support the NCI Agency in the evolution and execution of a program management and integration framework that will improve the coherence, change management, transparency, timeliness, quality, and interoperability of the Bi-Strategic Automated Information System (Bi-SC AIS) &amp; NATO General Communication Services (NGCS) Program.</p>
<p>The capability will provide a single resource to support the management, governance, assurance, and control of the implementation of the Bi-SC AIS &amp; NGCS Program and its constituent projects.</p>
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and 2) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government. In addition, contractor personnel will be required to have individual NATO SECRET security clearances. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Security Service Operations Center forwards to the NATO contracting entity the required NATO security clearance certifications.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-14171-PMIC and all correspondence concerning the IFB should reference this number.</p>
<p>This will be a single Firm Fixed Price contract with expected duration of 18 months with follow-on one-year options for extension of the contract for an additional three years.</p>
<p>Nominated bidders will be invited to attend a PMIC Industry Information Day, the purpose of which is to provide the latest available technical information and to give industry a forum to ask preliminary questions. Further details will be communicated to nominated bidders directly by the NCI Agency.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Please see attached.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list, however, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit the completed one-time NATO ICB application): 26 January 2016<br /><br />- IFB issued (target): February 2016</p>
<p>- Bid Closing (target) : May 2016</p>
<p>- Contract Award (target): Q4 2016</p>

The selected A-E may be required to participate in a pre-fee meeting within seven days of notification and provide a fee proposal within ten days of the meeting.  

The following selection criteria, in descending order of importance, will be used to evaluate the qualifications of the A-E firms:

Criterion (1).
  Firms specialized structural design and engineering experience in new construction, repair, alteration, and maintenance of piers, wharves, bridges, armories, and long span structures (e.g. warehouses, hangars, etc.), as well as structural engineering investigations of existing buildings and structures, in environments similar to Hawaii, Guam, Diego Garcia and other Pacific Ocean areas.  Submission of more variety in the types of facility projects will be more favorably considered.  Specialized design and engineering services include execution of DD 1391 or similar project programming document, FACD/design charettes, DB RFP solicitation documents, and DBB design contract documents.

Projects demonstrating specialized design and engineering services must be approximately $20 million or more in construction value completed within the past ten (10) years.
  


Submission Requirements:

SF330, Part I, Section F.  Submit a maximum of five (5) relevant projects, $20 million or more in construction value, completed in the past ten (10) years, which best demonstrates the firms recent specialized design and engineering experience in new construction, repair, alteration, and maintenance of piers, wharves, bridges, armories, and long span structures (e.g. warehouses, hangars, etc.), as well as structural engineering investigations of existing buildings and structures, in environments similar to Hawaii, Guam, Diego Garcia and other Pacific Ocean areas.  If more than five projects are submitted, the Government will evaluate the first five projects listed in Part I, Section F and disregard any other project information.
 A project is defined as either a stand-alone contract or a single task order in an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The Government will not evaluate information provided for an IDIQ contract and will only evaluate individual task order information. 

Section F, Block 24, shall include (1) contract number or project identification number; (2) contract period of performance; (3) contract award amount; (4) estimated construction cost; (5) general description of project; and (6) a detailed description of specialized design and engineering services.  

Section F, Block 24, shall also include a discussion of the firm that performed the project as pertinent to demonstrating the firms specialized experience.
  If a project was performed by a joint-venture (JV), and all JV partners are not on the proposed team, specifically address the work performed on the project submitted by the proposed JV partner(s).  If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the proposed JV partner(s), the project will be evaluated less favorably.  Similarly, if the proposed JV partner(s) worked as a subcontractor on a project, specifically address the work performed by the proposed JV partner(s) on the project submitted.  If a project does not provide requested data, accessible point-of-contact, or valid phone number, that project may be evaluated less favorably. If the A-E firm is a JV, information should be submitted for projects performed by the JV.
  If the JV does not have shared experience, projects may be submitted for each JV partner.  Failure to submit experience for all JV partners will be evaluated less favorably.

A sub-contractors or sub-consultants specialized experience will not be given the same level of consideration as either the prime contractor or the JV partner(s).  Prime contractor-sub-contractor/JVs/LLCs/LTDs with a demonstrated history of working successfully together on prior projects may be considered more favorably than those without such history.

<DESC>Pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the Contracting Officer may solicit from one source if the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source is reasonably available. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS), on behalf of the Office of Inspector General (OIG), intends to sole source to:
<p>First DataBank, Inc.<br />500 E 96th Street, Suite 500<br />Indianapolis, IN 46240-3767</p>
<p>OIG seeks to obtain 12 months of access to drug pricing data, drug-to-drug interaction data, and therapeutic class data to help: (1) provide OIG's Office of Audit Services with accurate background information during audits; (2) assist OIG's Consolidated Data Analysis Center and Office of Audit Services staff members perform data analysis work related to identifying potentially hazardous and/or fraudulent medical prescribing practices; and (3) support Medicare fraud investigations, new referrals for possible investigations, and criminal and/or civil litigation.</p>
<p>First DataBank is uniquely qualified to provide this access because it has developed a National Drug Data File (NDDF) software license that provides suggested wholesale price and other pricing data for all drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The NDFF allows OIG to access modules that are critical to its data analysis work, including the Drug-Disease Contraindications Module, the Indications Module; the Geriatric Precautions Module; and the Medical Lexicon Module.</p>
<p>First DataBank is the sole provider and distributor of the NDFF; no other vendors are authorized to sell the NDFF license. First DataBank creates the data and also develops and maintains the NDFF data for each customer.</p>
<p>The NDFF license is needed because OIG currently has a subscription to the NDFF. The NDFF data supports active investigations, audits, and cases that often involve court-related litigation or jury trials. As a result, if OIG is required to produce its data analysis used in support of Government litigation, its access to NDFF must be consistent and uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Finally, OIG's use of the NDFF has resulted in knowledge and efficiency: (1) OIG database administrators have created the database structures required to store and access NDDF data and have established reliable and efficient procedures for loading NDDF data into these structures; and (2) OIG data analysts have experience using NDDF data elements and have incorporated these elements in existing analysis programs. Transition to a different source will involve the creation of new database administration and data analysis procedures, along with the rewriting and re-execution of existing OIG analytic code currently using NDDF data.</p>
<p><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive proposal. No solicitation document is available. All responsible sources that have determined that they can provide the same services may submit product information and a capabilities statement that speaks to the services OIG is seeking in this proposed acquisition. The email subject line must reference OIG1228. All responses are due by December 30, 2015, 2:00 PM Eastern Time and can be sent to Khristine Agnello at Khristine.Agnello@psc.hhs.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract base upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>OIG requires one 12-month base period and one 12-month option period of parking garage access for 20 unreserved parking spaces and 1 reserved parking space with an electrical outlet and electric service for a surveillance vehicle in a secure parking structure located adjacent to the OIG office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The parking spaces will be used for OIG law enforcement agents who need to keep their vehicles and equipment safe and secure, and who also need quick access to their vehicles.</p>
<p>615 Chestnut Master Lease LP is uniquely qualified to provide the required parking garage access. 615 Chestnut Master Lease LP is the sole owner of the garage located at 615 Chestnut Street, and that location is required because it is the only garage that satisfies OIG's requirement that OIG law enforcement officers park their vehicles in a secure facility within one block of the OIG office.</p>
<p>OIG defines "secure" as having either a 24/7 gate or guard-controlled accessible parking, and it desires such a facility to be within a one-block radius of the building in which the law enforcement officers work. Such nearby parking allows OIG law enforcement officers to have expedient and judicious access to the vehicles assigned to them, and does not require OIG officers to transport sensitive or valuable information and/or equipment for a great distance. Additionally, the secure facility protects OIG's valuable vehicles that often are equipped with law enforcement technology. No other similarly secured garage is located within one block of the OIG office.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive proposal. No solicitation document is available. All responsible sources that have determined that they can provide the same services may submit product information and a capabilities statement that speaks to the services OIG is seeking in this proposed acquisition. The email subject line must reference OIG168261. All responses are due by December 31, 2015, 4:00 PM Eastern Time and can be sent to Khristine Agnello at Khristine.Agnello@psc.hhs.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract base upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>The mission of the Indian Health Service (IHS), Division of Diabetes Treatment and Prevention (DDTP) is to develop, document, and sustain a public health effort to prevent and control diabetes and related chronic diseases in America Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people and communities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The DDTP employs collaborative strategies in the 12 IHS Areas through coordination of a network of Area Diabetes Consultants, and approximately 500 Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) grant programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the DDTP is the primary point of contact for inter-agency as well as intra-agency communication on the prevention and treatment of diabetes and related chronic diseases in AI/AN communities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The IHS provides comprehensive primary health care and disease prevention services to approximately 2.1 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through a network of over 632 hospitals, clinics, and health stations on or near Indian reservations. Facilities are predominantly located in rural primary care settings and are managed by IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian health programs.<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The diabetes team provides not only clinical consultation services at Alaska Native Medical Center, but also statewide program technical assistance, epidemiologic data, prevention services, training and education for the IHS Alaska region.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>Funds are being allocated to the Alaska Area Diabetes Program, for the development of programs directed at improving the care of Alaska Native People with diabetes and at risk for developing diabetes. Funds were also used to enhance the diabetes surveillance statewide registry that had been tracking diabetes in Alaska Native People since 1985. With the addition of grant funds received in 2001, the Community Outreach Program was enhanced to meet the growing demand for services from the rural communities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Funds are also used to support a multidisciplinary team, for the development of patient education materials and to raise community awareness of healthy lifestyles throughout Alaskan communities.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Number: HHS-NIH-OD-OLAO-SS-16-012<br /><br />Project Title: Access to Wiley Subscription Services
<p>This is a "Sources Sought Notice". It is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations. The purpose of this notice is for market research purposes and will be used to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform the potential requirement described herein in the statement of work.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>PROJECT TITLE: Access to Wiley's Online Resources</p>
<p>I. Statement of Work<br /><br />A. Background Information<br />John Wiley &amp; Sons provides access to online resources for NIH staff and HHS agency staff served by the NIH Library (DLS), including over 1500 journals in a wide range of scientific, technical and medical subjects; the Cochrane Library; Current Protocols; and select online reference works. Links from PubMed, Web of Science&reg;, and the NIH Library website allow NIH staff to connect directly to the articles on the Wiley website following a search of the various sites. Wiley online resources allow DLS to provide enhanced and timely access to information NIH staff need to perform their work whether they are intramural researchers or extramural program administrators. Feedback from NIH and HHS researchers, clinicians and administrators indicates that the easy accessibility of needed information made possible by providing electronic access to Wiley resources has increased their productive work time, because of the time saved identifying and retrieving relevant articles.</p>
<p>B. Objectives</p>
<p>The specific objective of this requirement requires the contractor to provide the NIH and the HHS agency staff served by the NIH Library (DLS) access to the electronic version of all Wiley journals, the Cochrane Library, Current Protocols, and select online reference works through its web interface. Access will be cumulative for articles published in the journals since 1997 or the first year a journal was offered on the Wiley platform. The contractor is also required to provide access to other databases and journals as outlined under the "specific requirements" section of this SOW.</p>
<p><br />II. Services to be performed<br />A. General Requirements<br />1. Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment and facilities needed to perform the Statement of Work below.</p>
<p>2. All work under this contract shall be monitored by the Project Officer.</p>
<p>B. Specific Requirements</p>
<p>Specifically, the contractor shall:<br />1. Provide the NIH and the HHS agency staff served by the NIH Library (DLS) access to the electronic version of all Wiley journals, the Cochrane Library, Current Protocols, and select online reference works through its web interface.

<p>2. The contractor also shall provide options for acquiring eBooks, online reference works, and backfiles of selected journals. Options should factor in all previous investments in print and digital subscriptions, as well as previous archive backfile purchases.</p>
<p>3. The contractor may also provide options to include all Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies with access to the same resources as identified in this contract.</p>
<p>4. In the event of a major natural disaster (local, regional, national, or international), then in addition to the other rights granted under this Agreement, Wiley will allow DLS to provide access to the Licensed Electronic Products for a maximum of 180 days upon approval which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed after which time an extension may be granted to any otherwise unaffiliated health professional, ("Emergency Workers") and ("Displaced Users") from other institutions that are not included as one of DLS' Institutions but which have been affected by such a disaster ("Emergency Institutions") so long as the DLS has established temporary affiliation with such an Emergency Institution in order to meet the demands of the population affected by the disaster and any healthcare needs resulting from the disaster. For purposes of this Agreement, such Displaced Users, Emergency Institutions and Emergency Workers will be considered Authorized Users of the respective Institution that requests Wiley to provide the access to the Licensed Electronic Products under this clause. Under this clause, Wiley will allow previously unidentified IP addresses that are provided by DLS access to the Licensed Electronic Products.</p>
<p>5. DLS may fulfill interlibrary loan requests in accord with Section 108 of the United States Copyright Law (17 USC Sec. 108, "Limitations on exclusive rights: Reproduction by libraries and archives") and clause 3 of the Guidelines for the Proviso of Subsection 108(g)(2) prepared by the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works.</p>
<p>6. DLS shall retain perpetual access to all subscribed years of resources.<br /><br />C. Government Responsibilities</p>

<CONTACT>Denise R Lamb, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-757-5902, Fax 301-757-5973, Email denise.lamb@navy.mil
<DESC><p>1.0 Introduction<br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.2, and is published to obtain market research for use by the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM), Program Executive Office, Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons (PEO(U&amp;W), Navy and Marine Corps Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems Program Office (PMA-263), Patuxent River, Maryland. <br /><br />NAVAIRSYSCOM intends to issue Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) to provide PMA-263 with Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (STUAS) systems in accordance with the requirements contained herein. A BOA is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. A BOA is not a contract. Delivery/Task Orders issued under BOAs are the binding contractual actions, and each order issued shall be subject to the contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions of the BOA. Issuance of BOA's will be based on evaluation of qualifications in accordance with the criteria as set forth in this notice. Award of specific orders as requirements arise will be based on price/cost and other factors as deemed desirable and set forth for each specific requirement. The Government reserves the right to set-aside future BOA orders for small businesses contractors when practicable. In the event more than 1 BOA is issued, specific firm-fixed priced orders will be competed among the BOA holders. Individual orders will not be synopsized unless it is determined by the Contracting Officer that the requirements of FAR Part 5 have not been met by this notice for a specific order, or otherwise determines that synopsis of the requirement is in the best interest of the Government.<br /><br /><br />The Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of preparing submissions in response to this RFI and the Government's use of such information. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with the preparation or submission of the information requested. Submittals will not be returned to the sender. Respondents of this RFI may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals. <br /><br />Contractors that demonstrate that they meet the qualifications in paragraph 3.0 will be considered for issuance of a BOA. The Government reserves the right not to issue a BOA.</p>
<p>BOAs will be issued for a period of 3 years. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the BOAs. Government funds are obligated only to the extent that a duly issued order creates such an obligation. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued under the BOA. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. A BOA may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, NAVAIR may continue to place orders under the BOA.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE<br /><br />PEO (U&amp;W), PMA-263 is seeking industry inputs to identify Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (STUAS) systems capable of providing Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) in day and night operations, and in adverse environmental conditions. The systems are intended to build needed Foreign Partner capacity in accordance with Defense Security Cooperation Agency guidelines. <br /><br />These systems may build partner capacity in countries with differing levels of access to protected U. S. technologies. To this end, Section 4.0 asks respondents to identify the full range (minimum to maximum) of capability within configuration management control for technical attributes such as air vehicle performance, sensor performance, ground station performance, system architecture, communication link design, operating software, and any associated payload capability. <br /><br /><br />3.0 REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />("STUAS" or "the system" refers to the air vehicles and the ground system, to include the control segment, support equipment, launch and recovery equipment, and any ancillary equipment required to accomplish the mission.)<br /><br />System capabilities must be complete and qualified through test and demonstration. A system must be proven to work in its final form and under the expected operational conditions. <br /><br />The desired STUAS should be of lightweight design (Group 2 or low-end Group 3) and shall have the capability of providing real time full motion video via electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) sensors for maritime and land based operations with minimal setup and quick (1 to 2 hour) disassembly capabilities. Systems should be capable of reaching high altitudes to avoid detection or enemy intervention for transit to and from the operating area, with a normal operating altitude in the operations area of 3,000 - 5000 feet AGL.<br /><br />The air vehicle should be capable of autonomous or manual launch and recovery with minimal to no required modifications in a small confined area and hot or cold terrain conditions. It must be runway independent. The system configuration should be designed for quick (24 Hour) deployment, long range missions (minimum 10-12 hours flight time), quick turn-around times between day &amp; night operations. The minimal air vehicle performance attributes are listed in Table 1. <br /><br />The ground control station should be easily deployable and have the necessary equipment to monitor UAS sensor(s) position and status, control its movement and have the capacity to view video surveillance in real time. The system should be reusable and rugged enough to survive adverse weather conditions, unimproved areas, uneven terrain, urban areas, forested areas and salt water (maritime) conditions. <br />Required minimum system capabilities are listed below.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table 1<strong><span><br /></span></strong></p>

<CONTACT>Kim Yen Thi Nguyen, Contracting Specialist, Phone 6123363602, Email kimyen.nguyen@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE - THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE NOTIFICATION<br /><br />1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING <br />ACTIVITY:
<p>Requesting Agency:<br />USDA/APHIS/VS/SPRS DISTRICT 4<br />Attn: Purchasing Agent<br />903 San Jacinto Blvd, Rm 220<br />Austin, Texas 78701<br /><br />Contracting Activity:<br />USDA, APHIS, MRPBS, ASD<br />Minneapolis Procurement Branch<br />Butler Square, Fifth Floor<br />100 North 6th Street<br />Minneapolis, MN 55403</p>
<p>2. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING <br />APPROVED:</p>
<p>The USDA APHIS VS Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP) was developed to control spread of the Cattle Fever Tick throughout the United States. Currently, a permanent quarantine zone (PQZ) has been developed along the southern Texas border from Del Rio to Brownsville, approximately 600 miles. <br />One of the tools utilized by the CFTEP to eliminate fever ticks are Ivermectin medicated molasses tubs. Cattle consume the tubs, which then provides for control and elimination of fever ticks within the herd. The program intends to award a 5 year IDIQ contract to Positive Feed for their Ivermectin treated molasses tubs.</p>
<p>3. A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES, EQUIPMENT, OR SERVICES <br />REQUIRED TO MEET AGENCY NEEDS (INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED <br />VALUE OF THE ACQUISITION INCLUSIVE OF OPTIONS):</p>
<p>130 lbs. of molasses tubs utilized as supplemental protein, vitamin, and mineral sources for feeding livestock in field conditions. The 130 lbs. plastic tubs contain 30% crude protein, vitamin and mineral supplementation,and &nbsp;200 mg of Ivermectin, per pound, is then added to the product to aid in Cattle Fever Tick Eradication. The tubs are utilized on high risk premises as deemed necessary by epidemiologists from the CFTEP.</p>
<p>The estimated value of this acquisition is $212000 for all 5 years.</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUATORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING <br />NONCOMPETITIVE ACQUISITIONS:</p>
<p>The Statutory is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) or 253(c)(2) <br />FAR 6.302-1 when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the needs of the agency.</p>
<p>5. QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES <br />USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED:</p>
<p>A Minimum Use-Major Species Permit was obtained from the FDA for use of this product following a nine month field study. The study, being conducted by CFTEP personnel in south Texas, is evaluating the effectiveness of treating pasture raised cattle ivermectin thru the use of medicated tubs. It is hoped that the delivery of the ivermectin in this manner will provide a positive outcome to treat tick infested cattle in remote areas. Positive Feed Ltd applied for and was granted Investigatory New Animal Drug permit (INAD) number 011-938 by the FDA. This permit allows Positive Feeds, and only this company, to produce for the treated molasses tubs and supply them to the USDA for use in field trials being conducted by the VS Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP) in south Texas. INAD permits are issued by the FDA to allow field studies of newly developed drugs for use in field drug trials. Only the holder of the permit, Positive Feed, is allowed to produce the product for field testing.</p>
<p>6. A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE <br />SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS, OR WILL BE, PUBLICIZED AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 5.2, AND IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER FAR 5.202 APPLIES:</p>
<p>No other offers were solicited. Positive Feeds is the only company holding an FDA permit to manufacture Ivermectin medicated molasses tubs.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE <br />ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND <br />REASONABLE, AND THE BASIS FORTHAT DETERMINATION:</p>
<p>The cost of the treated tubs is currently $120.00 per tub while the cost of an untreated molasses tub with the same make-up is $105.00 per tub. Positive Feeds has provided pricing for a 5 year contract. Cost per tub is $120.00 for year one and two of the contract. Cost per tub will be $130.00 for years three, four and five. (See Attached From Positive Feeds)</p>
<p>In 2012, the treated tubs were $112.00 per tub. Since then, there is an approximate 7% increase in price for the for the first two years and $16% percent increase the following years. The basis of the tubs is feed which has a huge price swing based on availability. Price increase is justifiable to help cover potential price swings and is consistent with the previous expired contract (AG-6395-C-12-0129).</p>
<p>There is no public market for the treated tubs at this moment.</p>
<p>8. A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED (FAR <br />PART 10) AND THE RESULTS, OR AN EXPLANATION OF THE REASON <br />MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT PERFORMED:</p>
<p>As Positive Feeds is the only company with an FDA license to manufacture the product, market research was not performed.</p>
<p>9. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL <br />AND OPEN COMPETITION - FAR 6.303-2(a)(9):</p>
<p>No other companies hold an FDA license for manufacture of Ivermectin treated molasses tubs. This product is for use only by the CFTEP.<br /><br />10. This notice is for informational purposes only. No informal solicitation will be issued. A determination by the Goverment not to compete with this intended contract based on responses to this notification is solely within the discretion of the Government. Simplified procurement per FAR 13 will be used as well as commercial item acquisition of the commercial itens acquisition regulations per FAR 12. Any inquiries regarding this acquisition must be submitted by email to <a href="mailto:Kimyen.Nguyen@aphis.usda.gov">Kimyen.Nguyen@aphis.usda.gov</a> by&nbsp;Monday January 18th, 2016, 12pm central time.</p>

<DESC>USDA-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (AHPIS) Animal Care anticipates a sole source supply contract for the purchase of portable X-ray equipment in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (see attached justification) for the following requirement:
<p>Portable Radiological Veterinary Imaging Device and its associated components.</p>
<p>This contract will be for a Vetel VET-2430EZ Vetel Empower portable digital radiography system, carry case, hard carry case with foam insert, Mobile DR panel holder, 24x30 Lead scatter shield, small hoof tunnel, two Epona Blocks and a Poskom Vet 20BT 90/20/ Xray generator. Also included in this requirement is a 3 year warranty on hardware and 3 years of software support and upgrade/update program. This purchase also includes credit given for rental fees on current temporary equipment, trade-in credit for Poskom PXM-20BT, trade-in credit for a 2012 Envision 1210, shipping case and hoof tunnel. Also included is a credit for the unused portion of a Premium 5 warranty on the 2012 Envision 1210. The justification is attached to this notice.</p>
<p>The Animal Care program has utilized digital radiography technology consistently over the past 3 years to assist in enforcing the Horse Protection Act (HPA). Digital radiography is a form of X-ray imaging, where digital X-ray sensors are used instead of traditional photographic film. Advantages include time efficiency through bypassing chemical processing and the ability to digitally transfer and enhance images. Also less radiation can be used to produce an image of similar contrast to conventional radiography. Digital radiography has shown to enhance the Horse Protection Program inspection process by allowing us to visualize areas that the naked eye cannot see. It has become an additional diagnostic tool that is used to obtain objective and scientific data to help identify sore horses. We have been able to locate in the foot of the horse prohibited metals under the current HPA regulations as well as deformities to bony areas of the foot that are significant findings of a sore horse.</p>
<p>Currently the Animal Care program has a digital radiography unit that is a 2012 model that continues to have mechanical issues requiring constant repairs as well as it is lacking the upgrade components current digital radiography units are able to provide.</p>
<p>Interested sources that are capable of providing the equivalent supply listed&nbsp; including credits for the aforementioned items above are encouraged to submit statements of capability to the contracting office. Small business concerns are encouraged to participate. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice. Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature. Please provide past performance and references regarding your ability to provide this service along with your Statement of Capability.

Closing date for submission of Statement's of Capability is January 28, 2016 at 3:00 p.m. CST.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD - SOLE SOURCE PROCURMENT 
The Network Contracting Office 16, Fayetteville, AR intents to award a sole source contract to ARUP Laboratories for reference laboratory testing services for the Department of Veteran Affairs, Oklahoma City VA Medical Center, 921 NE 13th St, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.  The intent is to provide laboratory testing services with a viable contract to ensure that patient care shall not be interrupted nor delayed, or hindered in quality of patient care.  The anticipated award date for laboratory testing is January 1, 2016.  The amount of the contract is estimated $225,000 for the period of performance Jan 1, 2016 through Nov 30, 2016.
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  
The Department of Veteran Affairs, Pathology &Laboratory Medicine Service (P&LMS), Oklahoma City Medical Center  is requiring medical laboratory testing of patient specimens during the period of performance  Jan 1, 2016 through November 30, 2016 for testing  that is  not available from other vendors, for performance on all required testing.  The laboratory testing is for early disease detection, diagnosis and monitoring and/or to provide a definitive diagnosis or monitoring of the patient treatment plan.  The testing services are not performed in-house at OKC VAHCS or available through other vendors with the inclusive specific types of testing requested.  The Oklahoma City medical center is a tertiary facility with a high volume of testing and a requirement for testing services to be somewhat specialized, of high quality and fast result-time.  ARUP Laboratories is the only vendor has the capability to perform the required testing and perform testing within the time needed for patient care.  ARUP is the only vendor that can provide for testing services for several types of tests at one location.  The vendor must also be able to comply with reporting the results and ARUP Laboratories currently has a computer connection with Oklahoma City VA Medical Center for both ordering and reporting or results automatically.  A change in vendors would not be feasible as there is insufficient time to design, procure and implement a computer system with a new vendor that would provide for reporting results electronically with a computer connection through the Veteran Affairs medical center.  
These reference laboratory services, are all offered by ARUP Laboratories as an comprehensive menu tested at one location.  ARUP provides for collection and transportation of the specimens from the OKC medical center and the Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in the locality.  The vendor possesses all licenses and permits of accreditation and certificates required by law, and provides a comprehensive test menu that includes ordering codes, CPT Code, Test Methodology, Specimen Types, and test result interpretations, with  a fast turn-around-time to meet the needs of the medical center with the large patient care  population.  ARUP has the capability to ensure that all specimens are handled within all industry guidelines and Laws, such that patients do not have to provide duplicate samples for any "lost", or mishandled samplings.  This has a cost savings to the medical center as patients do not need additional appointments to provide for duplicate samples, and reduces the overall administrative costs to the medical center for labor and other expenditures.  This also increases the veteran patients' overall satisfaction of the quality of healthcare.  OKC Medical Center provides tertiary care with many specialized services (Neurology, Oncology, Transplant monitoring, Women's Health, etc.) and has a large and diverse patient population.  The patients require specialized testing; therefore one patient would need a comprehensive array of diagnostic tests for proper treatment.   
ARUP Laboratories provides patient specimen testing results to the Oklahoma City VA Medical Center through an established computer connection system already in place.  ARUP currently has a national MOU, privacy security agreement implemented.  The loss of utilizing this vendor for these testing services would result in a severe delay in patient care due to the need  to implement a new computerized connection between the medical center and a new vendor for test result reports.  Lack of a computerized system increases errors in ordering lab tests and entry of results via manual methods.     When submitting for lab testing manually with a vendor, human error is introduced.  A Computerized system virtually eliminates human errors for ordering lab tests and entering results.  The current computer system accesses the Veteran Affairs laboratory/patient software program, known as VISTA, and pulls orders for lab tests daily, and transmits the result data back into VISTA.   It removes all human interactions for ordering and data entry of results.  It is unreasonable to expect an integrated computerize resulting system to be implemented with the OKC VA Medical Center for results in a time frame for sufficient for quality patient care during the performance period requested.  
Orders and results are submitted electronically via a LEDI computer interface set up between ARUP and the OKC VAHCS Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service VISTA laboratory computer package.  Tests sent to the ARUP vendor has been defined within VISTA computer software to allow tis transmittal of orders and results to ARUP computer system.  This automated mechanism improves patient care by eliminating human errors, minimizing omission of tests orders, eliminating clerical/data entry errors in both ordering and resulting the tests, and decreases the turnaround of availability of those results to OKC VAHCS providers.  Setting up new laboratory tests, populating all of the computer fields for that and installation/implementation and testing of a new vendor computer interface is time consuming and not considered to be feasible for the performance period requested in this requirement.
NOTICE:
This notice is provided to verify that no other source other than ARUP Laboratories can meet this requirement due to the specific menu of the laboratory reference testing conducted at one location by ARUP laboratories and the already established computer interface connection between the Oklahoma City VA Medical Center and ARUP for testing reporting results.  This notice does not constitute an invitation for bid or a request for proposals and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.

<DESC>INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order to the LinkedIn, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043 for subscriptions: Career page, Recruiter Seat, and Job slots for one year. Under the authority of FAR 6.301-1 10 U.S.C. 2304, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies and Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. A justification and approval is currently being processed for this requirement. This requirement is intended as a sole source procurement because LinkedIn is the only resource that offers access to both active (active looking for a job) and passive (not looking but would consider another career opportunity) candidates. With over 300 million members globally and growing by 2 new members per second, LinkedIn offers the ability to identify and target the best candidates for vacancies, not just the best available individual. This also includes the ability to target diversity candidates via the &gt; 3,000 diversity groups on LinkedIn.
<p>CMS REQUIREMENTS: CMS uses the Social Media Network to provide unlimited job postings in 10 job slots. In addition it allows CMS to continuously post and take down jobs as often as liked. As one of the largest social media network in the world it is the perfect tool for CMS to post jobs. With CMS trying to fill several hundred vacancies every year this tool can greatly increase the applicant pool.</p>
<p>NAICS CODES: The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 519130 (Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals).</p>
<p>INTERESTED PARTIES: All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. In order to qualify as a potential contractor for this procurement, the organization must provide valid, reliable and standardized health care performance measures to support and advance public accountability, quality improvement efforts, increased patient safety, and value based purchasing. The organization must also meet the NTTA requirements for a consensus endorsement. To be considered, interested vendors must submit technical literature describing their capability to effectively satisfy this requirement, as well as terms and conditions and a complete price quote within 5 days of this notice, to the following electronic mail address: phillip.harrell@cms.hhs.gov.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This notice is not a Request for Proposals or a Solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. This notice is not a commitment from the Government. The Government will not reimburse any bid or proposal costs as a result of this notice. No solicitation exists and requests for a copy of the solicitation will be disregarded. However, any future solicitation that will be open to competition will be subsequently issued on FedBizOpps in order to permit firms to respond.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA <br /><br />(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this acquisition is to determine the stability of the Lead Compound as the hydrochloride salt, in a series of short and long term studies.</p>
<p>Project Background:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. <br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center that prides itself on its tremensously productive pipeline and is innovative in a number of ways. First, our quantitative high troughput screening (qHTS) paradigm, which tests all compounds at multiple concentrations in the primary screen, is unique. Second, the NCATS is distinctive in its focus on collaboration with outside investigators to produce high-quality chemical probes to define and assess new biology. This focus is reflected in our unprecedented Outreach program, which reaches hundreds of potential new investigators every year, and accounts for much of the new science being done at the NCATS. Third, the NCATS is uniquely focused on new technologies and paradigms to improve the process of translational science, typified by qHTS, our informatics platform, our utilization of structural biology to accelerate probe development, development of new synthetic and analytical chemistry paradigms. Ultimately, NCATS brings together a diverse range of scientists, including medicinal chemists, biologists, toxicologists, and engineers, in order to ultimately translate basic science into real products and services that help improve peoples lives. Included in this process is the the development of unique biological discoveries into potential pharmaceuticals which can greatly assist patients<br />In collaboration with other NIH institutes and outside academic researchers, NCATS is facilitating the development of Lead Compound as a potential treatment for refractory Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), a disease which affects millions of Americans. As part of the Development of Lead Compound for potential use as an investigational new drug (IND), the establishment of the relative chemical stability of Lead Compound is of importance. Chemical stability is of key importance, as a molecule that lacks the requisite long-term stability will require additional formulation work in order to stabilize it. In addition, various preformulation experiments, including solubility in various solvents, water uptake and phototoxicity are necessary.</p>
<p>Requirements<br />NCATS will provide up to 2.0 grams of lead compound for stability testing.<br />Contractor will provide a comprehensive report upon completion of studies, including all data and experiments.<br />Anticipated Period of Performance<br />The Contractor shall deliver manufacturer product within eight (8) weeks after receipt of order.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

    (vii)  Number of employees at your location.
    (viii)  Chief executive officer/key manager.

(e)  Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes five business days, should be taken into consideration when registering.  Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing. <BR> <BR>(f)  The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?
      (A)  Change the name in the SAM database; 
      (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and
      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. 
    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. <BR> <BR>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>(a) An agency protest may be filed with either: (1) The contracting officer, or (2) at a level above the contracting officer, with the appropriate agency Protest Decision Authority.

<p>Solicitation Number: FA8617-15-R-6199 15 July 2015</p>
<p>The purpose of this SSS Amendment is to provide Industry a REVISED PWS due to significant changes of requirements. The original SSS posted on 26 May 2015 remains applicable.</p>
<p>1. This SSS amendment and the attached revised Performance Work Statement (PWS) describe an acquisition strategy for an anticipated CLS/Maintenance Training program for the Afghan Trainer Program in Afghanistan. Vendors are encouraged to carefully review the entire PWS as there are multiple changes made throughout the PWS. The changes are too numerous to specify individually.

See PWS paragraph 1.2.2.</p>
<p>4. Describe your approach to performing maintenance of AAF responsible aircraft IAW PWS paragraph 3.2.4.</p>
<p>5. Remobilization. Since Afghanistan is an unstable environment there is the possibility that the contractor would have to relocate to another base during the contract period.

<DESC>This announcement was previously posted under solicitation number <strong>W91CRB-15-R-0047</strong>
<p style="text-align: left;">This announcement is not a request for proposals. Contractors shall not submit proposals in response to this notice.<br /><br />Generation II Advanced Bomb Suit (GEN II ABS) - for PEO Soldier</p>
<p>Proposed Solicitation Number: W91CRB-16-R-0002</p>
<p>The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground is issuing this pre-solicitation notice to announce the intent to issue a solicitation for the GEN II ABS.</p>
<p>Estimated Solicitation Issue Date: On or before&nbsp;29&nbsp;December 2015 with all documents, attachments and amendments posted at the FedBizOpps website located at the following address: https://www.fbo.gov. No hard copies of the RFP will be issued. All respondents shall be responsible for obtaining the documentation from the website listed above.</p>
<p>The Government intends to procure this requirement on an unrestricted, full and open procurement using procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 315990 Apparel Accessories and Other Apparel Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), in support of Program Executive Office - Soldier (PEO Soldier), Product Manager Soldier Protective Equipment (PM SPE) has a requirement for Gen II ABS systems. The current Advanced Bomb Suit (ABS) ensemble, consisting of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) 8 bomb suit and EOD 9 Gen 2 helmet, is too heavy/bulky, restricts mobility and dexterity, and has limited sizing for full body protection and efficient utilization for US Army EOD Soldiers. Further, the current ABS lacks an effective integrated cooling system capability.</p>
<p>In response to the constantly changing and increased threats encountered, the Army has identified a need to improve and redesign the ABS ensemble to provide not only a higher level of protection, but also to improve the mobility and capability of the EOD Soldier. The Army will be seeking improvements to the helmet and suit of the ABS as a system and, individually. Further it is important to highlight that the Generation II Advanced Bomb Suit (Gen II ABS) is a Non-Developmental Item (NDI), which asks Industry to propose existing, complete designs that are either in production or waiting for a requirement to begin production.</p>
<p>The US Army intends to place the best available Non-Developmental GEN II ABS in the hands of the Warfighter as quickly as possible. The Solicitation will use Best Value with Price Tradeoff were Soldiers feedback is significantly more important than price. Industry designs with no Government design participation will be exclusively evaluated for this program. Executed in two phases, Evaluation (Phase 1) and Production (Phase 2), this solicitation will support the evaluation of multiple designs and allow Soldiers to select the highest rated system to receive FAT approval.</p>
<p>Phase 2 Production will be executed as a requirements contract with an estimated initial quantity of 153 (10% of the ABS Army Acquisition Objective) systems and estimated maximum quantity of 1,538 (full AAO) systems.</p>
<p>A reduction in weight, improved sizing tariff, and integrated cooling capability are the focus of this improvement effort. The number one objective of the Gen II ABS is to reduce weight while improving form, fit, and function. To achieve this, new ballistic, fragmentation, and blast protection materials offer the potential for significant weight reduction while providing the same level of protection or better. Further, the Army is seeking an expanded sizing tariff for the helmet and suit to improve the fit and function for each EOD Soldier. Finally, the Army is seeking to leverage dramatic improvements in cooling system technology by incorporating an enhanced integrated cooling system into the suit.</p>
<p>Based upon these requirements, the following improvements are proposed as they have potential to provide immediate impact for EOD Soldiers:</p>
<p>&bull; Weight: The weight and weight distribution of the ABS ensemble must not significantly impede mission efficiency. The current ABS weighs 74 pounds for a size medium. The objective for the GEN II ABS is to reduce the weight of the current ABS by approximately 15% to 40%</p>
<p>&bull; Size: A lack of proper sizing increases the ABS' system weight issue. Currently there are only four sizes for the ABS suit (small, medium-small, medium and large) and a single helmet with a series of adjustment pads to fit the full sizing tariff. Updated anthropometric data on the US Army Soldier population indicates the need for new sizing. Specifically the Gen II ABS shall be designed to accommodate the full range of user personnel, i.e., 5th percentile female through 95th percentile male for full body protection and efficient utilization by EOD Soldiers.</p>
<p>&bull; Improved Cooling System. EOD technicians require an integrated cooling system to keep core body temperatures within normal range in hot environments. Prolonged exposure to high physical output and temperatures rapidly degrades the operator's ability to effectively perform their duties. The current ABS cooling system is not integrated (adds time to don/doff) and is dependent upon readily available ice in order to provide temperature cooling inside of the bomb suit. Both of these inherent design characteristics make the system unfavorable for Soldiers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Information</span>:</p>
<p>Offerors shall be able to deliver one (1) medium Gen II ABS end item with all components with ballistic test data from an NIJ certified lab within sixty (60) calendar days AFTER release of solicitation.</p>
<p>The Gen II ABS system, in any of its configurations, is considered a critical safety item (CSI). All items being procured under this acquisition are subject to the Buy American Act and Berry Amendment.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding up three (3) FFP contracts, one contract per system design under Phase One, and one (1) FFP Requirements contract with a four (4) year ordering period under Phase Two. Awards will be made to the best overall proposals (Best Value), which are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government.</p>

To list four (04) Questions asked and the Governments Response.

1. Question Asked:  Would the contractor be matching existing lighting fixtures or is there a fixture the customer is looking to have installed and can a   manufacturer/model number be provided in either case?  Goverment Response:  LED fixtures are preferred, either Lithonia Mfg. or approved equal.  Submittal will be required.
2. Question asked:  Is there a panel located closer than the 450 Ft mentioned in the drawing provided? Because of the voltage drop the contractor would have to pull # 3 thhn copper just for receptacles and this would be very expensive. Governments Response:  No other electrical panel is closer than 450 ft.  It is understood that it will require a No. 3 THHN copper wire.
3. Question Asked: Would the new light fixtures be hung from aircraft cable be acceptable if the alternate (new acoustic ceiling) is not taken? Goverment Response: Yes aircraft cable can be proposed and will be acceptable.
4. Question Asked: Is there a clean path from the existing panel to the new room for conduit or will the contractor need uni-strut racks hung from bar joists? Governments Response:  New EMT can be routed between the steel bar joist and it is clear from one room to the other.

ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAINS THE SAME IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.

Amendment #0001

Questions/requests for clarifications must be received by the Contracting Officer, at dave.keehan@faa.gov, no later than 4:00 P.M Eastern Standard Time on January 6, 2016. The FAA will post to FAACO, by January 11, 2016, answers to all clarification requests. Responses to this RFI/Market Survey are still due no later than 2:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on January 29, 2016.
---------------------------------------------------------------

1.	Background:
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) currently uses 900 MHz digital microwave radios to support communications requirements within the National Airspace System (NAS). The microwave radios are primarily used in Alaska and can experience severe weather conditions. In most cases, the microwave radios serve as the primary communications medium and must be highly reliable.  

The current model of microwave radios, the GE-MDS LEDR 900S, has reached the end of its operational supportability. The FAA is considering the replacement of the existing microwave radios through a technology-refresh program. 

2.	Purpose:
The FAA is requesting information from providers of digital microwave radio systems as it considers procurement strategies for a possible replacement for existing digital microwave radios. 

3.	Description of the Required Capabilities:
The FAA requires digital microwave radios capable of operating in the existing 932-935 MHz and 941-944 MHz Government Frequency bands. Ideally, the radios will be tunable within these bands by users in the field. The radio must be operable on 120V 60Hz AC power and fit within one rack unit (1.75) of a standard 19 electronics-equipment rack. In addition, the radio must support a minimum radiofrequency (RF) power output of 1 Watt as measured at the transmitters antenna-output port. The FAA desires the radio to be operable with transmit/receive frequency spacing of 9 MHz.

4.	Additional Information:
	This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposals. 
	The FAAs issuance of this RFI is not an assurance a procurement will occur.
	The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. 
	The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to this RFI/Market Survey.
	Any costs associated with the RFI/Market Survey response submittals are solely at the interested partys expense.
	Information provided in response to this RFI/Market Survey is for the FAAs informational purposes only and will not be released to the public.  
	Any proprietary information submitted must be marked as such.  

5.	Instructions:
Interested parties should submit the following items in response to this Market Survey / RFI by January 29, 2016:
	A 1-page letter of transmittal on company letterhead that identifies a company point of contact, including name, title, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address;
	A Capabilities Statement of no more than 5 pages (12-point Times New Roman font, 1-inch margins); and
	A completed and signed Business Declaration Form (Attachment 1). 

The Capabilities Statement should include the following information:

A.	Technical Capabilities of the Available Radio Equipment
1.	Provide a brief description of the product potentially offered to meet the requirements described in Section 3 of this RFI / Market Survey.
2.	Identify the RF power output levels supported by the recommended microwave radio (as measured at the transmitters antenna output port).
3.	State whether the radio can operate on 120V 60Hz AC power and if other power options are available.
4.	State whether the potentially offered microwave radio can operate with TX/RX frequency spacing of 9 MHz.
5.	State whether the recommended microwave radio can fit in a 1-RU rack mountable chassis.
6.	Identify the data rates, modulation, and coding schemes supported by the radio. Describe what is involved in changing the rate, modulation, and coding.
7.	State whether the power output at the antenna port is adjustable by the user.
8.	State whether the recommended microwave radio supports Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). If so, state the versions of SNMP that are supported.
9.	Identify the Interfaces supported.
10.	State whether the transmit and receive frequencies can be tuned by users within the frequency range specified above. If so, state whether it is a manual process or there is a software tool available to support the task.  If a single radio cannot be tuned across the frequency band, describe the frequency range of a single radio and state whether any subassembly may be exchanged to change the range. 
11.	Indicate whether the radio includes a built-in multiplexer.  If so, describe the extent of the multiplexing capabilities.
12.	Identify any enhanced security features of the microwave radio.

B.	Product Support Provided
1.	Indicate whether your company provides implementation support for the recommended product. If so, is it included in the unit price of the product or priced separately?
2.	Identify the geographic scope of product support that your company provides for the recommended product. 
3.	Describe the levels of support available in terms of response times and hours of operation. 
4.	Describe your warranty/repair/replacement policies for the recommended product.
5.	State whether the warranty includes product updates and bug fixes. 
6.	Describe the technical documentation available for the recommended product.
7.	Describe the training your company provides relative to the recommended product in terms of the mode of delivery (e.g., classroom or online), duration, materials provided, and any restriction on use of those materials by the Government.

C.	Pricing
1.	Indicate whether pricing for your recommended product is available on a GSA schedule or on your corporate website. If so, provide the pricing and a URL.
2.	State whether you offer discounts for volume purchases. If so, at what volume levels?

5.	Indicate whether there are any licensing costs associated with any parts of the recommended solution.
6.	Indicate whether operations and maintenance (O&M) training is included in the purchase price or if it is available at an additional cost. Indicate whether the training materials can be licensed for reproduction and use by the government.

D.	Corporate Overview
1.	Identify the number and dollar value of microwave radios your company sold during your most recently completed corporate fiscal year. Indicate the corresponding percentage of your total corporate revenue.
2.	State how long the recommended product has been in production, how much longer the current model is expected to be in production, and how much longer the current model is expected to be supported by your company or a third party. 
3.	State where the recommended microwave product, including key components, is manufactured.
4.	Indicate whether your company meets the Small Business Size Standards under Small Business Administration guidelines for either of the following NAICS codes:
	334220  Airborne Radio Communications Equipment Manufacturing
334419  Other Electronic Component Manufacturing
If your company does not meet the Small Business Size Standards for one of these NAICS codes, you may suggest another NAICS code for which you meet the size standard if it is relevant to the scope of this RFI.
