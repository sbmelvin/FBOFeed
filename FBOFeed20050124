<CONTACT>Troy Teachey, (202)267-7386
<DESC>The FAA is seeking information on PAPI systems with Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights.  This will assist the FAA's investigation of using LEDs in approach lighting systems in the National Air Space (NAS).  The information provided shall discuss how the LED PAPI system will meet the following requirements: Light beam: The Lamp Housing Assemblies (LHAs) of PAPI LED shall be able to provide a split beam of light consisting of white in the top sector and red light in the bottom sector. The transition from red light to white light shall occur within an angle of 3 minutes of arc at the beam center and within an angle of 5 minutes of arc at the beam edges. The transition band shall be flat to within 3 minutes of arc. Light intensity: Each PAPI unit shall meet the minimum intensity requirements as shown in figure 1 at the maximum intensity setting. Light color: The light colors shall be aviation white and aviation red. Light beam aiming tolerance: The centerline of the transition zone (i.e. the vertical area of change from red light to white) of each LHA projected light signal shall be parallel to the zero aiming angle projection within plus or minus five (5) minutes of arc. This shall be interpreted to mean that the projected vertical transition zone signal angle will be coincident with the LHA aiming angle to the tolerance stated, and is a measure of the aiming accuracy of the LHA/Aiming device combination. Potential offerors must provide the technical documentation that describe how the PAPI LED prototype that is available (or in development) meet these requirements above. For those requirements that are not met by this PAPI LED prototype, the FAA is interested in how easily the un-met requirements can be added and the time frame for such developmental activities. Advise whether the absent requirement is currently being developed through internal research and developmental (IR&D). From a future announcement the FAA may purchase developed prototypes for further testing. FAA anticipates using the information contained in your responses to refine its future PAPI requirements. FAA views this request as one of several additional market surveys. Proprietary information/data may be submitted and will be handled according to FAA procedures. All information should be submitted by April 24, 2005 to the attention of Mr. Troy Teachey, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, D.C. 20591.  It is required that the submittals be 2 hard copies and in Microsoft Office 2003 software. If there are any questions with regard to this market survey please call Mr. Teachey at (202)267-7386.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking a contractor to manage and operate the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF), in Newport News, Virginia. TJNAF is a premier, DOE dedicated-program, national research facility located on a 162  acre site. TJNAF conducts key elements of DOE's missions in science, specifically nuclear physics. TJNAF is also designated as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) and a premier DOE laboratory that provides extensive capabilities in both world-class research expertise and unique facilities and are generally beyond the capability of any nongovernmental institution to construct or operate. Through these national resources, which are available to researchers from universities, industry, other government agencies and other nations, the Department advances the energy, national security and economic well being of the United States, provides for the international advancement of science, and educates future scientists and engineers.  Anticipated funding for FY 2005 for TJNAF, from all sources, is approximately $100,000,000.  TJNAF is an international leader in experimental and theoretical research of the quark substructure of nuclei, the fundamental building blocks of matter. The laboratoryâ€™s nuclear research increases our understanding of the fundamental structure of matter and the forces that hold it together. The laboratory serves an international user community of approximately 1,100 scientists, primarily from universities. It also is the national leader in the development of superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) accelerating technology. TJNAF is dedicated to the development of intense sources of electron and photon beams using the SRF technology.  At the center of the laboratory is the worldâ€™s first large-scale superconducting electron accelerator located in an underground tunnel almost a mile long in circumference.   The SRF core technology benefits not only TJNAF but also advances other research facilities in DOE Nuclear Physics and Basic Energy Sciences and the Department of Defense.

<DESC>The Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS) intends to award a commercial, multiple award, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to acquire wet (Aircraft Crew Insurance Maintenance) and dry (Aircraft Insurance Maintenance) leased aircraft.  The commercial test program procedures established in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.5 will be utilized.  Each IDIQ contract awarded will be for a one (1) year basic period and four (4) one-year options, with individual delivery orders to be issued for any supplies/services furnished as a result.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 532411.  This procurement will be unrestricted under full and open competition.  A Firm-Fixed Price contract is contemplated.  The basic period of performance will be from the date of award through 30 Sep 05.  The period of performance for option terms will be as follows:  Option I, 01 Oct 05 – 30 Sep 06; Option II, 01 Oct 06 – 30 Sep 07; Option III, 01 Oct 07 – 30 Sep 08; Option IV, 01 Oct 08 – 30 Sep 09.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in order to select the offer(s) that is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered, and are included in the relative order of importance.  Offers will be evaluated on their 1) past performance on similar projects, 2) price, and 3) to be considered for award, the offeror submitting the proposal must clearly demonstrate at the time of proposal submission that it has the ability to provide aircraft operated and maintained in accordance with an FAA approved program for a certified Title 14 CFR Part 121/125/135 operator, as applicable.  Demonstration of this ability by an offeror shall be by the presentation of applicable Operating Certificates for themselves or their first tier subcontractor.  In the event multiple contracts are awarded under the resulting solicitation, the Government will issue at least one order for the minimum quantity of 5 flight hours for each contract so awarded.  However, if a contractor is unable to perform, the 5 flight hour minimum guarantee will be considered to have been met.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. DJMS-05-R-0006 will be available on Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) on or about 09 Feb 05, with proposals due thirty days from the issue date of the RFP.  The RFP will be posted in its entirety at the FedBizOpps website.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be issued and no electronic proposal submissions will be accepted.  All proposals from responsible sources shall be considered.  All questions must be submitted in writing either via e-mail or fax to the following by 3:00 PM CST on 22 Feb 05:  Shelley Bothwell, shelley.bothwell@usdoj.gov, FAX 405-680-3466.  NOTE:  Contractors proposing on the solicitation must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for award or payment for any delivery orders issued.  The CCR database may be accessed via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  

JPATS has a requirement for the delivery and use of U.S. registered, transport category, turbojet and/or normal category, turboprop aircraft on a short-term notice via leasing agreement.  All aircraft shall have a valid Certificate of Airworthiness at time of delivery to JPATS.  On a normal operating basis, JPATS will provide as much lead time as possible.  However, on an emergency basis, JPATS will require status from the contractor within two (2) hours as to the availability of an aircraft for wet (ACIM) leases only.  The aircraft are required in the event JPATS aircraft become temporarily inoperable or if additional capacity is needed.  All aircraft furnished to JPATS for lease shall be on an as needed basis.  The anticipated Contract Line Items (CLINS) are as follows for the basic/option years:  X001- X003 Wet Lease Turboprop (passenger capacity 8-19, 20-50, and 51-60); X004 thru X014 Wet Lease Turbojet (passenger capacity 8-19, 20-50, 51-90, 91-120, 121-139, 140-170, 171-220, 221-270, 271-300, 301-350, 351-500; X015 Dry Lease Turbojet, Hawker 800 or equal; X016 Dry Lease Turbojet, Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) MD83 or equal; X017 Dry Lease Turbojet, Boeing 737-300 or equal; X018 Dry Lease Turbojet, Boeing 737-400 or equal; X019 Reserved.  Each identified CLIN will have associated sub-CLINS for positioning/depositioning.  The unit of issue is flight hour which is measured from the moment the aircraft first moves under its own power for the purpose of flight, until the movement comes to rest at the next point of landing.  The turbojet aircraft will generally be required to depart from and return to a JPATS site, normally Oklahoma City OK, Alexandria LA, or Mesa AZ.  On occasion, other airports may be designated by JPATS for air operations.  The turboprop aircraft will generally be required to fly weekly round trips between the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, or on occasion other airports designated by JPATS.  Additional sites for performance, if required, will be established on each individual order.  When requirements exist, a normal JPATS mission consists of 5 flight hours per day for turbojet aircraft and 3 flight hours per day for turboprop aircraft.  The contractor shall provide the aircraft, all maintenance (including line maintenance/line servicing/heavy maintenance/aircraft cleaning), logistics support, and insurance.  The contractor shall also provide a crew for wet (ACIM) leases.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is in the process of requesting Proposals (RFP) for renovations to the Federal Building / Post Office  located at 657 Second Avenue North, Fargo, North Dakota.  GSA is soliciting contractors to participate in the “Best Value Source Selection” process for this project.  This process has been set aside for procurement under the Small Business Administration’s 8(a) Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Step One requires the offeror and major subcontractors (Electrical only) to submit a technical proposal, without pricing.  Each Offeror must be a general contractor, and each offeror must submit between two (2) and four (4) major subcontractors. Following evaluation of the Technical Proposals, the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) shall make a Competitive Range determination that will include all offerors considered to have a reasonable probability of being selected for award.  All  offerors will be allowed to continue in the Source Selection process, however, those that fall outside of the competitive range will be notified that the SSEB has determined that they do not have a reasonable probability of award.  Step Two of this procedure will require the submission of priced proposals and management plans.  Following a final evaluation of the Price and management proposals, the SSEB shall determine which offeror to award the contract to based upon its Best Value analysis.

The following is a brief description of the construction.  This project consists of all labor, equipment, material, transportation, and supervision necessary to complete this renovation.  The building was constructed in Fargo in 1969 and contains 4 stories, a basement, and a penthouse and provides a gross area of 24,121 square meters (259,635 square feet) to house approximately 404 employees.  There are 31 structured parking spaces within the building and 115 surface parking spaces in a lot adjacent to the building.  The major tenant in this building is the U.S. Postal Service, occupying 45% of the building.  Other tenants include the Internal Revenue Service, Small Business Administration, Social Security Administration, Congressional Offices, and GSA operations.  The General Construction Contractor shall be professionally licensed in the State of North Dakota.  The project will generally consist of the following scope of work: major upgrade of the electrical system, repair and replace elevators, replace and re-grade paving, complete window replacement, fire protection upgrade, handicapped accessibility upgrades, security enhancements, interior alterations, exterior façade repairs, and improvements to the postal dock.  Warranties/guarantees, finishes and related management requirements will be included.  Portions of the work, especially in occupied tenant spaces, will have to be performed during non-working hours.  Total project construction costs, including all designated Government allowances, are estimated to be in the range of $5 Million to $6 Million.  The design was prepared by the architectural firm of ACLP Architecture of Denver, Colorado.

			Steven R. Farrington, Contracting Officer

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory has a requirement for architectural and engineering services and anticipates awarding one Architectural-Engineering contract as a result of this synopsis.  It is anticipated that the award amount for this contract will be between $300,000 and $600,000.  The contractor will be required to provide multi-disciplined design work with an emphasis on the architectural and engineering disciplines.  Asbestos and lead are know to be present, therefore the A&E firm shall identify and provide a design which will accommodate the disposal of these materials in the construction plans and specifications in accordance with applicable rules and regulations.  The purpose of this project is to renovate and update the laboratories in Building 207.  There are approximately 40 laboratories per floor and there are three floors.  There is a utility corridor that serves the laboratories.  The laboratories are to have the existing cabinets and hoods removed along with the floor covering, ceilings and lights.  Some of the existing walls are to be removed where two existing single laboratory modules are to be combined into a double laboratory module.  The new laboratories are to have new floor covering, ceilings and lights.  New cabinets systems with integrated electrical will be provided.  Fume hoods will be provided as required but to the extent that the existing exhaust and HVAC systems will accommodate.  The work will be staged so as to minimize the disruption to the ongoing operation of the building.   No more than a quarter of the building may be disrupted at any one time.  Minimization of noise, dust, etc. is a priority during construction.  Hazardous materials are known to be present.  These include but are not limited to asbestos, mercury and PCB (in sealed light ballast).  Remediation of all hazardous is to be part of the construction contract. When hazardous materials are encountered, the A&E Contractor will be required to conduct hazardous materials surveys, including testing and sampling, provide design removal procedures and prepare construction contract documents in accordance with applicable rules and regulations pertaining to such hazardous materials. All hazardous materials licenses and/or accreditations necessary for the locality of the project site are required by the A&E firm or their subcontractors. Services, such as technical reports and studies, site investigations, contract documents (drawings, specifications and construction cost estimates), surveys, shop drawings reviews, construction consultation and inspection, and construction record drawings may be required at any time up to final acceptance of all work.   The A&E shall work extensively with the occupants of the spaces to determine the requirements and limitations of the renovations.  This will require at a minimum two weeks of meetings with the occupants (individually and as groups) to explore the current and future needs of the occupants.  During this period, the A&E shall develop alternatives and document with narratives and sketches the evolution of the design process.  Once approved, the A&E shall develop the design to meet the occupants’ budget and time constraints.  The selected A&E firm for this contract will be required to participate in an orientation and site visit meeting (when requested) within seven days of notification and provide a fee proposal within ten days after receiving the Request for Proposal.  The Estimated Costs of Construction is approximately $4.5 million.  Because this contract could eventually result in an award over $500,000, a subcontracting plan will be required from the selected firm, should the prime contractor be a large business.  Firms responding to this announcement must do so in accordance with the requirements set forth in Note 24 and the evaluation criteria listed at FAR 36.602-1 and DFARS 236.602-1, which are being presented below in descending order of importance: (1) The contractor shall provide specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, with significant emphasis on Architectural, Mechanical and Electrical engineering disciplines. This proof of specialized experience and technical competence must include, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials. The A&E firm must indicate past experience by citing examples of the work required. Responding A/E firms must address both of the potential projects. (2) The contractor shall provide professional qualifications of personnel and proposed subcontractors for the project.  Examples must be provided for similar projects performed by the proposed team and the duties performed by each of the team members. If the proposed team has not worked together before, the firm must provide experience of the individuals with their proven ability to work in a diverse team environment.  (3) Each contractor must also provide convincing evidence of the firm's, as well as, the entire team's capacity to accomplish the work within the required time limits (fourteen weeks for the average projects plus Government review time). (4) The contractor must provide past performance information on contracts with Government agencies and private industry, which demonstrates cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. Demonstrating this should include, at a minimum, things such as letters of commendation/appreciation, a list of contracts, the points of contact and phone numbers for references. (5) Contractors will also be evaluated on their location, which typically should be in the general geographic area of the project, provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.  Contractors must be sure to include the location of each of the proposed subcontractors. (6) Contractors must provide the volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense (for the last twelve months). Those firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement, and wish to be considered, must respond no later than 4:00 P.M. EST on the response date specified herein.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks the following modifications to a NIST owned single-mode, fiber-laser system that produces approximately 1 W of narrowband radiation at 1.126 microns.  Specifically, NIST would like to add a preamplifier stage directly after the master laser that will boost the master laser power from 15 milliwatts to 40 milliwatts.  NIST requires the power to be sent through an acoustical-optical modulator (AOM) prior to the amplifier stage.  This will allow NIST to frequency- and intensity-stabilize the fiber laser in the infrared prior to doubling its frequency in a stabilized cavity. Additionally, NIST seeks to have a port by which to extract 5 milliwatts of the infrared beam subsequent to the AOM but prior to the amplifier to use for diagnostics and the realization of the mercury, single-ion optical clock.  Finally, NIST wants a smaller noise pedestal, which requires changing out the present multi-mode pump laser for a single mode laser. The new, single-mode pump source will help to reduce the noise pedestal from about 100 kHz to about 30 kHz or less.  NIST Proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis with Koheras A/S, Blokken 84, 3460 Birkrod, Denmark a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) for these modifications.***This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Under $100,000). This synopsis is issued for information purposes. Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or email. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.

This notice constitutes the only solicitation; Quatations are being requested and a written solication will not be issued.  This soliciation is a 100% small business set-aside under NAICS code 511210.  The small business size standard is $21 million.  EPA Region 4 intends to purchase the following items: 1) Environmental Data Management System Software in accordance with requirements listed below, 1 lot; 2) Annual Maintenance for the period March  1, 2005 through February 28, 2006, 12 months; 3) RockWorks 2002, 5-pack concurrent use license, 1 each; 4) LogPlot 2003, 5-pack concurrent use license, 1 each; and 5) Golden Software's Surfer Version 8.5, 5-user concurrent use license, 1 each.  Environmental Data Management System Software  Requirements  for EPA Region 4 Science and Ecosystem Support Division 	1.  The Science and Ecosystem Support Division (SESD) of U.S. EPA Region 4 requires 5-concurrent user licenses of an environmental data management system software, including the installation disks, documentation, training,  and upgrades and maintenance/technical support for one year.  The Division also requires 5-concurrent user licenses for additional software (including the installation disks, documentation, training, and upgrades and maintenance/technical support for one year) that is also described below. 	2.   The software will be used to manage environmental data from the various programs administered by Region 4.  It must be able to meet the needs of environmental professionals using advanced software to solve more complex problems as well as generating simple tables or reports. Environmental Data  Management System Software: 	1.  The data management system software shall allow for the rapid analysis and interpretation of the data, and maintain the quality of the data as well.  Such analysis and interpretation includes graphs (such as those created by spreadsheets, i.e., Microsoft "Excel" or  Lotus "123") and maps using ArcGIS 9.  Maps are also important as a visualization tool, allowing for the accurate representation on paper of the extent of contamination on or in the ground, as well as facilitating communication with site stakeholders.  Other visual information software tools  considered important are RockWorks 2002, LogPlot, and Surfer 8.5.  A  software module is also needed that will allow casual users to generate tables and charts using a simplified, easy to understand browser-based interface. 	2.  In addition, the software shall be easy to use, permitting a familiar  browser-based interface that will allow casual users to generate standard tables, reports, and charts based on specified criteria. 	3.  In order to rapidly and accurately create any of the items mentioned above, the environmental data management system ("system") shall meet the following  essential requirements: 	a.  The system shall manage data from multiple environmental media (i.e., ground water, soil, sediment, surface water, air, waste, etc.). 	b.  The system shall handle a variety of kinds of data including chemical (including QA/QC information), spatial (3D), temporal,  geological, field observations, and physical parameters). 	c.  The source code and data model shall be made available so that EPA Region 4 may make any modifications to the system that are deemed necessary or desirable (i.e., if the company goes out of business, further development may still  occur, or if Region 4 chooses to reprogram a part of the system for any purpose). 	d.  The system shall be "non-proprietary" so that the data may be accessed with or without the system's software, using widely available software and tools, and so that new interfaces to the data may be created  without the need for additional licensing. 	e.  The system shall reside on EPA Region 4 computer systems. 	f.  The system shall be Section 508 compliant.  This information can be accessed electronically at: www.section508.gov. 	g.  Ownership of and unencumbered access to the data shall be  retained by EPA Region 4. 	h.  The system shall allow for the easy or transparent exchange of data with EPA Region 4 member states, as well as with other agencies as EPA Region 4 deems appropriate, necessary, or otherwise desirable.  The system shall natively support the Region 5 Electronic Data  Deliverable (EDD)-(see URL  http://www.epa.gov/region5superfund/edman/). 	i.  The system shall enforce data quality in a uniform manner (for example, an analytical result can not exist without an analytical test entry, a field sample entry, and a location entry, etc.). 	j.  The system shall be  capable of generating cross-tab tables of data in various formats including, .pdf, .xls, and .html format files.  The system shall be capable of generating the tables against at least two standards selected by the user (for example,  Federal and State).  The interface to the cross tab function  shall allow for saving of queries to be used against new data and the easy generation of new tables. 	k.  The system shall have advanced query capabilities with a plain-English interface and associated reporting capabilities. 	l.  The system shall have the ability to place data (such as a queried  subset) into and tightly integrate with other software without the user having to manually export, and then import it (for example, into "Microsoft Excel" for graphing, ArcGIS" for mapping, Surfer 8.5 for contouring, RockWorks 2002 for boring logs, etc.); the system's integration capability shall  be such that the user's actions in the graphing/visualization/modeling software is minimized as described above. 	m.  The system shall allow for automated data checking, acceptance and loading (i.e., importing) of data via integration with Lotus Notes email server, generating automated email  reports detailing the success or failure of the load. 	n.  The system shall be implemented as an  enterprise level setup, capable of supporting 100+ users (with additional licensing at some point in the future.  However, it is not intended to purchase the additional licensing under this order.).  	o.  The enterprise level software shall be installed on-site by the vendor within 30 days after award. 	p.  The vendor shall maintain a "Help Desk", or other available staffed resource to answer questions about the system. 	q.  This software shall be commercially available, ready to use as  installed.  	r.  The system shall enforce relational and referential integrity, the standard programming techniques for normalized databases.  	s.  The system shall be capable of automatically pushing graphs and reports to the end  user,  based on triggers set by the user. Ancillary Software  (shall tightly integrate with environmental data management system as described in Paragraph l above): 	1.  RockWorks 2002 integration (including the RockWorks 2002 software), 5 concurrent -user licenses. 	2.  LogPlot integration (including the LogPlot software), 5 concurrent-user licenses. 	3.   Surfer 8.5 integration (including the Surfer software), 5 concurrent-user licenses. 	4.  ArcGIS 9 integration (NOT including the ArcGIS 9 software), 10 concurrent- user licenses.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) will be conducting a full and open unrestricted competition (but see last paragraph) to award a contract for advisory and assistance and systems engineering and technical assistance (A&A SETA) support services to the MDA in the execution of its mission.  This will be a follow-on contract to MDA Contract HQ0006-04-C-0013 with Computer Sciences Corporation, which expires June 30, 2005.  While primary support under the contract is for the MDA Deputy Director for Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Integration (MDA/DN), the MDA Deputy Director for Technology & Engineering (MDA/DT), and the MDA Chief of Staff (MDA/DS), similar A&A SETA support will also be provided as required to the MDA Director (MDA/D), Deputy Director (MDA/DD), Executive Director (MDA/DX), Deputy Director, Business Management (MDA/DM), and Deputy Director, International Affairs (MDA/DI).
The resultant contract will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed/Base-Fee-Award Term Level of Effort for Direct Productive Labor Hours (DPLH) and associated other direct costs.  The term of the contract, if all options are exercised and/or awarded, is anticipated to be five (5) years: One (1) one-year base period; one (1) one-year option period; and three (3) one-year award term option periods.  The contract will require delivery of up to a maximum of 132,000 DPLH of A&A SETA support per contract year (approximately a 66 man-year equivalency for the three primary areas of support combined, DN, DS and DT).  Support will be provided primarily on site at MDA Headquarters in Arlington, VA, or other on site MDA National Capital Region (NCR) locations.  All personnel require a SECRET clearance, and several personnel supporting DN and DT will also require a TOP SECRET clearance and must be eligible for Sensitive Compartmented Information access.  A successful offeror must be able to provide 75% of personnel with SECRET clearances within 30 days of contract start date (planned for June 15, 2005) and 100% within 90 days of contract start date.  Interested parties are invited to electronically submit their company’s name and points of contact to the contracting office as early as possible, but not later than February 16, 2005.  The subject line for all electronic correspondence shall start with “HQ0006-05-001” (but see last paragraph).  NOTE:  The MDA Server will delete all “ZIP” type files, so only attached MS WORD/Excel compatible files or PDF files in electronic correspondence.
	Services to be provided include, but are not limited to: 1) providing senior independent technical and programmatic assessments on a broad range of issues affecting the development, deployment or operation of missile defenses; 2) executive services for the MDA Executive Management Council, including but not limited to tracking of taskings, issues, correspondence and policies, meeting planning and coordination, strategic planning, executive communications support and emergency preparedness support; 3) meeting support for program and organizational reviews; 4) strategic planning and executive communications support; 5) BMDS Integration and Engagement Sequence Group management support including research and analysis and document preparation supporting cost, schedule and performance management, executive actions, lessons learned, program support officers and working group support; and 6)issue tracking, studies and analyses in the areas of safety and mission assurance support.
It is anticipated that proposals will be technically evaluated primarily on 1) the technical expertise (relevant recent experience) of the proposed staff to accomplish the Statement of Objectives (SOO) efforts, 2) technical understanding and approach to determine the adequacy of an offerors’ experience manifesting a capability to perform and/or support identified activities, and 3) corporate experience to determine the adequacy of the extent (i.e., number of contracts) and significance (i.e., size, complexity, involvement/contract share) of corporate experience, including subcontractors and key personnel, in accomplishing efforts relevant to those in the SOO.
A Draft SOO and Draft Request for Proposal, as well as other supporting documents, are located on the MDA Business Acquisition Reporting Bulletin Board (BARBB) New Procurements and Awards website at http://www.acq.osd.mil/mda/barbb/newpa.html.  The subject matter title is “RFP for MDA Front Office - DN, DS, DT A&A SETA Support.”  Industry comments on these documents should be forwarded electronically to the Contracting Officer (Marc.Lesser@mda.mil) and the Contracts Specialist (Joseph.Dooley.ctr@mda.mil).  Again, the subject line for all electronic correspondence shall start with “HQ0006-05-001” (but see last paragraph).
As stated this requirement is planned as unrestricted; however, MDA may set-aside this requirement for small businesses if a sufficient number of qualified small business sources respond.  Small business sources must also demonstrate to MDA’s satisfaction that the restrictions of FAR 52.219-14 (b)(1)“Limitations On Subcontracting (DEC 1996)” will not: (1) hinder their ability to provide the varied skills/capabilities/attributes required of the staff to meet this requirement, and (2) hinder their ability to respond to quick reaction tasks and temporary surge requirements necessitating highly skilled individuals possessing unique capabilities and experience.

Interested small business firms are invited to submit to the contracting office as early as possible, but not later than February 1, 2005, a three (3) page Capability Statement per contract line item (CLIN) (a separate CLIN each for DN, DS and DT), summarizing the corporate strengths in relation to the following criteria:  1) Personnel qualifications and relevant experience; 2) Specific, related corporate prime contractor past/current DoD experience related to this requirement; and 3) Management approach in managing on-site staff, retention/replacement, authority, responsibilities, and quality control.  All small business respondents shall confirm that their size status is small under the NAICS code size standard and address the aforementioned FAR 52.219-14 issue.  Also, please specify by name one primary and one alternate Point of Contact within your firm, including the respective telephone numbers and email addresses of those individuals.  All information must be contained within the three-page capability statement limit.  Responses may be provided electronically, in hard copy, or both.  Submit electronic submissions to both Marc.Lesser@mda.mil and Joseph.Dooley.ctr@mda.mil.  The subject line for all electronic Capability Statement correspondence shall start with “HQ0006-05-001 SmBus.”

<SUBJECT>D -- Development and Maintenance of CRIMSON
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-N01-AO-30014

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to award a sole source modification for an increase in the level of effort, in support of the continuing development, improvement and maintenance of the Clinical Research Information Management System (CRIMSON) of the NIAID. Services will be procured on a sole source basis from the current contractor; Systex, Inc. Systex, Inc. possesses the unique ability to handle this requirement.  

The CRIMSON Clinical Data Management System is predicated on the use of client software that will run in both Macintosh and PC Operating Systems and will produce interfaces with a complexity that XML languages cannot. Systex has developed and maintained the current system using 4th Dimension, GQL, and Sybase software tools.  Systex has extensive experience with cross-platform development and with the development of the orphaned programs currently in use in CRIMSON, such as, Andyne and GQL.  

In addition, the development of database solutions for clinical care and research documentation and data warehousing requires an in-depth knowledge of clinical practice and research documentation standards as set for by institutional and regulatory authorities, privacy and security standards set to protect patient data, data standards for submission of research findings set by regulatory agencies and the environment and personnel who do clinical research and care. Systex possesses the required experience with development of clinical research data management systems that meet the unique needs of the NIAID DIR clinical research program.  The experience of Systex is crucial to the management and maintenance of this system. 

The current contract was awarded on a sole source basis to Systex, Inc. Because Systex, Inc. is the current contractor, and because of their expertise of the CRIMSON system, the Government believes that no other offerors would be available or suitable to provide the additional hours necessary for this contract.  Any questions regarding this requirement should be addressed to Michele DiNatale, Contract Specialist, at (301) 402-5644, or dinatalem@niaid.nih.gov before the synopsis closing date of March 9, 2005.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>DONA APGAR, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3271
<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement Introduction:The U.S. Army, Research Development and Engineering Command, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Armaments Engineering & Technology Center (AETC), Weapon Systems & Technology Directorate, is soliciting concepts, for a nonlethal projectile that will provide an electrical area stun effect to temporarily incapacitate a small group of belligerents.  The goal of the program is to explore concepts that could be the basis for a new nonlethal capability that would support the U.S. in future urban policing and combat situations. General Requirements: Proposals are solicited to design, manufacture and test prototype projectiles that will enhance the ability of the warfighter to engage belligerents with a new nonlethal option.  The proposals should be in the form of White Papers that will describe how the contractor will investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of applying advanced technologies to achieve personnel incapacitation at extended ranges.  The proposals shall address the tasks listed below.Specific Requirements, OBJECTIVE:To design, build and launch a prototype projectile that would deliver electrical energy to a small group of targets, as opposed to a point target, in order to (near instantaneously) incapacitate the targets in a non-lethal manner. DESCRIPTION,Currently, blunt trauma projectiles are used to incapacitate individuals but the energy delivered to the target decreases with range as the projectile loses velocity.  Further, the effect on the target can be excessive for a small person or inadequate for a large, target.  The use of stored electrical energy, acting as an  electromuscular disruptor (EMD), will have relatively  the same effect against an individual, when it impacts against that individual, regardless of range or target size.  However, currently available EMD devices require the user to directly contact the target with the device or fire tethered darts that are limited to a distance of approximately 7 meters.  The purpose of this effort is to develop a projectile that would be capable of delivering an EMD effect to a small group of individuals out to a range of approximately 100 meters.  The projectile would derive its electrical energy from launch using conventional propellant, through the use of energy storage, or energy generation within the projectile.  The projectile would not be tethered to the launching platform as in current versions of electrical incapacitation devices.  Innovation is encouraged in how to store, generate, deliver, and vary the electrical energy to the target but the stated target effects are of greater importance.  The preferred launch platform is the 40mm M203 grenade launcher but other standard platforms (e.g., 12 gauge shotgun, etc.) will be considered.Procurement Strategy:  It is anticipated that contracts for the Phase I, in-lab proof of principle demonstration, will be awarded to the 2 candidates that submit the best White paper proposals.  As a result of the Phase I efforts, 1 or 2 candidates will be downselected for Phase II prototype development and testing at a government proving ground.  Candidates will be requested to submit formal contract proposals for their Phase II efforts at that time.Additional information: (1)  Anticipated Period of Performance:Phase I:  6 months Phase II:  24 months (2)  Phase I Expected Award Date:  31 Mar 05 (3) Phase I Government Estimate:  Up to 2 contracts at $65K/contract (4)  Phase I Type of Contract:  Firm Fixed price (5) Phase I  Government Furnished Equipment: None PHASE I:The contractor will research, design and manufacture a proof-of-principle projectile that will be able to rapidly deliver electrical energy to an area target in a non-lethal manner.  The projectile would be self-contained and not tethered to the launching platform.  The launching platform would be a 40mm M203 grenade launcher or a 12 gauge shotgun.The contractor will perform the following tasks. Task 1:  Concept development. Establish areas of focus, top-level systems concepts and preliminary performance goals.Conduct an assessment of the technologies necessary to enable the proposed concepts to determine what technologies are available and their level of maturity. Research and detail the basic method of energy storage and/or generation.  a) Research and detail the method of fuzing that may be used to cause the projectile to function between 30 meters and 100 meters from the operator. Task 2:  Design the prototype projectile. Task 3:  Manufacture prototype projectiles.  A quantity of projectiles will be manufactured that is sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of the design. Task 4:  Conduct an in-lab, proof of principle, demonstration in which the projectiles will be fired at a target and document the effectiveness of the projectiles.  The projectiles may be functioned by methods that simulate typical projectile fuzing as the objective of this in-lab demo is to show the effectiveness of the concept rather than to design the fuzing method. Task 5:  As a result of the demonstration, further develop the concept and submit a proposal with a ROM (Rough Order of Magnitude) cost for the Phase II effort.  The results of the Phase I effort will be used to justify further funding of the concept. PHASE II:  Develop and build a quantity of proof-of-principle prototype projectiles.  These projectiles will contain all of the elements required for proper functioning of the projectile.  A series of test firings will be conducted at a government approved test  range to evaluate the projectile's effectiveness from 30 meters to 100 meters. The technical proposals should address the following:(1)Technical Concept and Approach:  In this section, offerors should provide as much technical detail and analysis as is necessary or useful to support the technical approach and development they are proposing.  If the offeror has a "new and innovative" solution to the problem(s), that solution should be presented in this evaluation.  The preferred technical approach should be described in as much detail as is necessary or useful to establish confidence in the approach and enable thorough evaluation.  The level of maturity of the concept should be stated.  (2) Understanding the Problem:  A successful program cannot be conducted without a complete understanding of the larger technology picture and intended end application.  The proposal must convey an understanding of the technical challenges and limitations of the system under development and the intended application.  This can be accomplished by citing previous attempts to solve similar problems and their subsequent shortcomings. A general discussion of how the proposed approach will overcome these shortcomings should be included for comparison purposes.  Additionally, an overall summary of the technical issues addressed by this proposal needs to be included.  A program plan should be included to present an orderly progression of the issues to be addressed.(3)Qualifications and Relevant Experience:The proposal should contain a summary of related experience and capabilities to perform design work and concept demonstrations.  (4) Cost estimate:  the proposal should include a cost estimate for the Phase I effort only and should include the following details.  a.Direct Labor:  The type of labor and number of hours must be accompanied by a narrative describing what each will do, why it is required and amount of hours each will consume to complete the task.  b. Subcontractor:  If applicable, Rationale as to why a subcontractor is required.  The types of LABOR and NUMBER of HOURS must be accompanied by a narrative describing what each will do, why it is required and amount of hours each will consume to complete the task.  If labor categories are the SAME as those negotiated on your Basic contract you must treat these as Direct Labor. c.  Travel:  What travel is required, to where and how many trips are required.  (Only if applicable).  d.   Material, Types of material, quantity, and rationale why it is required.  Basis for award, evaluation factors and approach:Awards will be made to those offerors whose proposal represents the "best value" to the government as reflected  by the evaluation criteria established below.  The government will weigh the relative benefit of each proposal and awards will be made based on merit rating with the merit rating being significantly more important than price.  The  Contracting Officer will perform an integrated assessment of the merit rating & price in making the source selection decision. Under "best value," the government reserves the right to award contracts to other than the lowest priced offeror or to other than highest technically rated offeror.  Each proposal will be evaluated by a team of Government Engineers who will assign a rating based on their assessment of the offerors proposed concept approach.  The ratings received for the evaluation factors described below will be combined into a merit rating.  Price will be evaluated for reasonableness and cost sharing, if any, will be considered.  Price will not be scored.  If merit ratings are equal, price could become determining factor.  Each of the areas and factors are listed below:  Evaluation Criteria:1. Technical concept and approach (65%) - The concept should be based on sound engineering principles.   The development path from concept to demonstration should be clearly stated. The projectile should be ballisticly similar to current 40 mm projectiles and should require little or no modification to the M203 weapon.  2. Understanding  the problem (20%).  - The proposal should demonstrate that the offeror understands the concept of EMD devices,ammunition and the technical possibilities and barriers to solving the problem.  3. Qualifications and Relevant Experience (15%):  The proposal should show that the offeror has appropriate related experience and the capabilities to perform  design work and concept demonstrations.  Notice that the "White Paper" proposal is not required to include the Phase II system development program cost and schedule.  Only the program cost and schedule for the Phase I effort needs to  be included in the "White Paper."  The contract period of performance will be 6 months for completion of all tasks for Phase 1 and 24 months for Phase II.  Multiple awards are anticipated on a Firm Fixed Price Basis.  The estimated level of funding expected per award is up to $65,000.  Proposals are due on the FEBRUARY 28, 2005 at 1300 EST.  Proposals will be submitted in electronic format using MS Word, MS Excel and MS Power Point compatible formats.  Each part shall be as brief as possible, consistent with complete submission.  The suggested length for the technical proposals is 5 to 15 pages.  The cover page of the proposal should include the title, name and telephone number for the principal point of contact (both technical and contractual), and any other information that identify the proposal.  The cover page should also contain the proprietary data disclosure statement, if applicable, as well as the proposal price.  Any resulting contracts will contain appropriate FAR and DOD FAR Supplement clauses (and any implementation thereof) appropriate  for the type of contract.   Proposals shall be sent to Donna Apgar, EMAIL ADDRESS:  dapgar@pica.army.mil by 28 FEBRUARY 2005 at 1300 EST, POC for this action is Donna Apgar, Contracting Officer, 973-724-3271.

All interested firms are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximu m practicable extent with small and small disadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507.  If a large business firm is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontrac ting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. Of those dollars the large business firm intends to subcontract out, the Corps of Engineers floors for subcontracting are 50.9% to small business concerns; 8.8% to small disadvantaged business c oncerns; 7.2% to women-owned small business concerns; 2.9% for HUBZONE concerns; and 0.5% to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business. The term 'floors' is  used instead of 'goals' as the Corps of Engineers objective is to exceed the percentages rather than merely meet the percentages. Large firms should keep these floors in mind when considering qualifications of potential subcontractors and ensure that each  proposed subcontractor's socio-economic status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications.  The NAICS code is 541330. The size standard is $4,000,000. Responses to this ad should be in writing only; telephone calls and personal visits are d iscouraged.

Visitors requiring access must present a drivers license, current passport, or similar positive identification.  Fac simile copies are not acceptable.  Security personnel are neither Government employees nor Government contractor employees.  For purposes of determining whether an offer is late, delivery into the hands of security personnel will not constitute delivery to  the Government.

<DESC>This amendment is posted to clear up any confusion for the due date of technical proposals.  The due date is November 24, 2004.

******************************************************************
******************************************************************

The General Services Administration (GSA) is in the process of requesting Proposals (RFP) for renovations to the Federal Building / Post Office  located at 657 Second Avenue North, Fargo, North Dakota.  GSA is soliciting contractors to participate in the “Best Value Source Selection” process for this project.  This process has been set aside for procurement under the Small Business Administration’s 8(a) Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Step One requires the offeror and major subcontractors (Electrical only) to submit a technical proposal, without pricing.  Each Offeror must be a general contractor, and each offeror must submit between two (2) and four (4) major subcontractors. Following evaluation of the Technical Proposals, the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) shall make a Competitive Range determination that will include all offerors considered to have a reasonable probability of being selected for award.  All  offerors will be allowed to continue in the Source Selection process, however, those that fall outside of the competitive range will be notified that the SSEB has determined that they do not have a reasonable probability of award.  Step Two of this procedure will require the submission of priced proposals and management plans.  Following a final evaluation of the Price and management proposals, the SSEB shall determine which offeror to award the contract to based upon its Best Value analysis.

The following is a brief description of the construction.  This project consists of all labor, equipment, material, transportation, and supervision necessary to complete this renovation.  The building was constructed in Fargo in 1969 and contains 4 stories, a basement, and a penthouse and provides a gross area of 24,121 square meters (259,635 square feet) to house approximately 404 employees.

<DESC>THIS IS THE SOLICITATION NOTICE.  RFTP IS NOW AVAILABLE.  SEE DETAILS BELOW.  NO HARD COPIES WILL BE PROVIDED.  

The project is a continuation of a four-phase program to renovate an 18-story office building.  Approximately 188,000 gross square feet of the 1.2 million gross square foot building will be renovated in this project.  Estimated award range is $20,000,000 to $30,000,000.  Completion time is 715 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about August 29, 2005.  This contract is restricted and limited to only those firms having (1) an existing general construction contracting office as of the date of this announcement within the four state region  consisting of Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska; (2) meeting the minimum requirement of having worked on a similar or partially similar project – defined as an interior office renovation or other renovation project with a high level of interior finishes and complexity (new construction projects will not be evaluated); (3) a hazardous materials abatement subcontractor whose on-site supervisors for this project possess the Supervisor / Missouri State Certificate for Asbestos Related Occupations and their most recent required refresher training certificate; and (4) a data wiring subcontractor whose on-site supervisor for this project has been certified by Building Industry Consulting Services International, Inc. (BICSI).

This project will be limited to floors 11 through 14; miscellaneous lobby work on floors 15, 16 and 18; and stair towers on floors 11 through 18.  The building will be occupied during construction, however floors 13 and 14 will be initially vacant.  The 12th floor tenant will vacate the floor and move to 14 after completion of 14th floor work, the 11th floor tenant will move to 13, the 10th floor tenant will move to 12 and the 9th floor tenant will move to 11.  Limited above ceiling work on the 10th floor generally related to 11th floor plumbing is also required.  Base Bid Work:  Generally consists of general demolition, and asbestos and lead paint abatement; reconfiguration of existing shaft openings; seismic bracing of shaft walls; complete renovation of lobbies and restrooms including reconfiguration of restrooms; wood paneling, terrazzo, drywall partitions, paint and plaster, new ceramic tile walls and floors; new ceilings, lighting and above ceiling HVAC throughout the floor; and new building signage/graphics.  Option Bid Work:  Generally consists of tenant improvements including new drywall partitions, doors, frames and hardware, plaster, paint, vinyl tile, carpet and vinyl base, casework, new panel boards, tenant power distribution and data drops; computer room chiller; meeting certification standards to qualify for a LEED Certified rating; stairway egress improvements; and Building Automation System work.  Phased substantial completion dates are required.

Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  Construction work disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed outside of normal business hours.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures.  The Government intends to use the “trade-off process” in selecting the prime contractor.  The “trade-off process” is a method of evaluating both the technical factors specified in the solicitation, the price and an optional in-person interview.  For this solicitation, the goal is to select the proposal that offers the best combination of technical qualifications, price and an optional interview.  The Government intends to award the contract to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, with technical factors being considered more important than price. The object is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price. Proposals will be evaluated in three stages.  Stage One, the Request for Technical Proposals (RFTP) will be issued on or about 01-24-05.  The RFTP will consist of technical evaluations to establish those within a competitive range. The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel, (3) Management Plan, and (4) Sustainable Construction Materials and Methods.  Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality.  Offerors whose proposals fall within the competitive range will be invited by the Government to make Stage Two submissions, which shall consist of Pricing, a subcontracting plan and special competency requirements. Offerors whose technical evaluations do not meet minimum requirements will be notified by phone or letter that they will not be allowed to submit a price proposal. Offerors whose technical evaluations are not in the competitive range will also be so notified; however their price proposals will still be received and evaluated. Pricing Packages will be issued on or about April 11, 2005.  Initial Price proposals will be received in this office on or about May 20, 2005. Offerors should submit Stage Two price proposals that are acceptable without additional information, as the Government may make the final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability based solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted. The Government may proceed with the award of the contract without discussion. However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors. A request for final price proposals will be issued on or about May 29, 2005.  The offeror with the highest technical rank and the lowest price will be considered the most advantageous.  If the ranks of two or more offerors are approximately equal, the higher technical proposal will be the offer considered most advantageous. As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important.  If the selection board deems it necessary or desirable, they may invite selected firms to an in-person interview, which shall constitute Stage Three. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the combination of technical qualifications, price and the interview, if held, that is the most advantageous to the Government. The Government will evaluate all proposals that meet the minimum requirements.  

The Request for Technical Proposal (RFTP) includes a general scope of work, completed Design Development level drawings and outline specifications, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.  In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of construction solicitations and amendments.  The solicitation (specifications and drawings) and its amendments will only be available through a link in FedBizOpps to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov <http://www.ccr.gov>) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov <http://www.fedteds.gov>).  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications and drawings) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  The drawings are being provided as .DWG and .PDF files.  Drawings can be viewed from Autodesk.  Bidders are responsible for producing their own print sets for their use.   

Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  At minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: 

1.	Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Company's CCR Point of Contact, 
2.	Your Company's DUNS Number (800-333-0505 if you do not have one) or CAGE Code 
3.	Your Company’s Tax ID Number, 
4.	Your Telephone Number, and 
5.	Your E-Mail Address.  

Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.

Your CCR registration should take approximately 48 hours for processing and activation.  Once you have registered with CCR you may then register with FEDTeDS to view solicitations.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may register with FEDTeDS via the following URL https://www.fedteds.gov/.  If you have not used the site previously, please go to "Register with FedTeds" and read the Vendor User Guide.  The official planholders list will be based on only those requesting specifications through FedTeDS. 

There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on or about, February 15, 2005, at 10:00 a.m., local time, in room N133 of the Richard Bolling Federal Building, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri.  Proposals will be received on Tuesday, March 1, 2005, at 2:00 p.m., local time.  Specific location is specified in the RFTP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  The Government will evaluate submissions to establish those within a competitive range.

Prior to award of contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.

The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  All responsible sources not limited by the restrictions stated in the first paragraph may submit an offer, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.  

The RFTP specification and Construction Documents are available ONLY by link via this announcement.

<DESC>The systems to be purchased will be used by the US Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory to capture and print images of evidence under microscopic examination.  Their firearms division examines and documents bullets, cartridge cases, and a wide variety of toolmark evidence.  They use comparison microscopes to compare evidence collected at a crime scene to test fired ammunition and/or test impressions made by questioned tools in the lab.  The system will be used to visually document these comparisons.  The camera must mount and focus properly on the microscope used by the crime lab.  The imaging system components must be compatible with the Leica UFM 4 and/or Reichert comparison microscopes. These microscopes cost many times what this imaging system does and it all has to work together.

Line item 2 is for their Trace Evidence Division and will be used for similar purposes to document various types of trace evidence (e.g. hairs, fibers,glass and paint fragments, etc.).  It must be compatible with the Leica FS4000 comparison microscope.

<DESC>The first modification issued this date completely replaced the description of the synopsis.  This second modification provides answers to questions received to date.  

NOTE:  Any inconsistency between this document and the synopsis shall be resolved by giving precedence to the synopsis including all modifications. 

QUESTION 1: 	Is registration with the Central Contractor Register required?

ANSWER:   	Yes.  The synopsis description has been amended to include the requirement.  

QUESTION 2: 	Is the response date still April 12, 2004 by 4:00 p.m.?  

ANSWER:	Yes, April 12, 2004 by 4:00 p.m. local time.

QUESTION 3:	Please advise if a one-person firm with available subcontractors can respond and compete for this project.

ANSWER:	The ID/IQ A/E service contract will have multiple task orders issued at different times, with many being performed simultaneously for more than one geographic location.  Hydrology may or may not be part of projects for the next five years.  A hydrologist would, of necessity, subcontract the greater part of the work and provide the professional A/E warranty for each task order and the entire ID/IQ contract.  A one-person consultant firm can team with prospective prime consultant A/Es for work in the expertise arena.  

QUESTION 4:	There must be a way for large and small DBE firms to acknowledge who is available and capable.  The pre registration must be keyed so we can find out how to contact the large firms and offer our services. 

ANSWER:	The synopsis has been amended as follows:  “Interested parties are encouraged to register to receive changes and register for the interested vendor list.”  The option to “View List of Interested Vendors” has also been added.  

QUESTION 5:	This appears to be a single selection.  Is there any chance that it might be divided into a few smaller contracts that small businesses like PEC could handle as a prime?  

ANSWER:  	No.  The Government need is for one award, as advertised.  

QUESTION 6:	Who is currently under contract for these services? 

ANSWER:	MWH America’s, Inc. (MWH), is the incumbent contractor.

QUESTION 7:	What other firms have had this contract?

ANSWER:	There has only been one contract to MWH.  

QUESTION 8:	Is the IBWC pleased with the past consultants efforts?  

ANSWER:	Yes.
  
QUESTION 9: 	Is this a continuation of the existing contract or is it a solicitation for an additional provider?

ANSWER:	The ID/IQ is targeted for award 10-01-04 for a base year with four option years.  It is a new contract providing follow-on A/E service from the current contract that expires 09-30-04.

<DESC>The sources sought synopsis is modifed to include the geographic restriction, which is provided elsewhere in this notice.    The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone concerns or for Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business concerns.  The estimated value of this procurement is between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00.  The small business size standard is less than 1,000 employees.  The acquisition is to dry dock and repair the USCGC NEAH BAY (WTGB-105), a 140 Foot ICE BREAKING TUG.  The homeport of the vessel is Cleveland, Ohio.  The performance period is FOURTY-TWO (42) calendar days and is expected to begin on or about 01 August 2005 and end on or about 11 September 2005.  The scope of the acquisition is for the overhauling, renewing and repairing of various items aboard the USCGC NEAH BAY (WTG-105).  This work will include, but is not limited to:  welding repairs;  remove, inspect, and reinstall propeller;  clean ballast tanks and voids;  clean and inspect fuel and oil tanks;  clean sewage and grey water collection and holding tanks;  overhaul shaft seal;  preserve transducer hull ring;  upgrade heating system;  overhaul and renew valves;  renew sea strainers;  preserve main mast, fore mast and stub mast;  service liferafts and hydrostatic releases;  preserve underwater body; preserve freeboard;  routine drydocking;  provide temporary berthing;  provide temporary messing;  remove boiler overboard discharge valve;  renew hot water heater;  renew dielectric matting;  pull test pad eyes;  renew a/c system valves;  renew deck in O2 space;  renew insulation in various compartments;  renew hot water booster;  renew fire plugs and main deck monitor;  provide temporary logistics and provide additional temporary logistics.  All welding and brazing shall be accomplished by trained welders, who have been certified by the applicable regulatory code performance qualification procedures.  At the present time, the acquisition is expected to be issued as a small business set aside.  However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305 if your firm is HUBZone certified or a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to lromano@mlca.uscg.mil or by fax at (757) 628-4676.

At least two references are requested, but more are desirable.  Your response is required by January 26, 2005.  Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a Hubzone set aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total Hubzone Set-aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.   All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone set-aside.  Failure to submit all information requested may result in an unrestricted acquisition.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
(1)Is there a special form or format for submitting capabilities packages?  No just a 10 page limit on the entire package.
(2) Are the award for the PMTSS program going to be full and open competition?  2 of the contracts will be full and open competition.  The third contract will be a small business set-aside.  There is no specification as to what kind of small business, such as, 8(a), Veteran owned, Woman owned, etc.
(3)Will the three contracts be awarded to three different contractors? Yes
(4)Is it expected that all three contracts will run concurrently?
Yes.  All three contracts should be awarded at the same time and have the same period of performance.  Starting at the same time and expiring at the same time.
(5)In reference to the Customer Analyst Support position.  Is it expected that the individual(s) filling the position(s) will have a Top Secret clearance at the time of the contract award or is it acceptable to achieve Top Secret clearance after the contract has been awarded?  All positions must be filled with persons who have at least an interim Top Secret Clearance.  Completion of the clearance after award is acceptable.

POC:  ADRIENNE REXROAD, phone: (937) 255-6161, ext. 3161, email:  adrienne.rexroad@wpafb.af.mil DESC:  Notice of Contract Action for A-10 ENGINE UPGRADE, POC: Mr. Leroy Long,  CONTRACT NEGOTIATOR, phone: (937) 255-3385 ext. 3022, email:  Leroy.Long@wpafb.af.mil, Mr. Lewis Reed, CONTRACTING OFFICER, phone:  (937)  255-3385 ext. 3057, email: lewis.reed@wpafb.af.mil.   The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding a  requirement for a TF34 propulsion performance upgrade for the A-10 weapon  system.  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, Agile Combat  Support Wing, Propulsion Squadron, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  As formally documented in MSIP ORD (2001), the A-10 has long been recognized  as underpowered.  During FY04, the current Secretary of the Air Force and the  Chief of Staff for the Air Force (SECAF/CSAF) requested the USAF address this  need. The most effective solution is a kit upgrade to current engine. The  upgraded engine must 1) still fit in current nacelle, 2) not require major  structural mods, 3) produce sufficient additional thrust to address identified  deficiencies, and 4) be funded from within A-10 program in accordance with  (IAW) SECAF/CSAF direction.  To meet cost and schedule constraints, the A-10  Engine Upgrade must be based on mature technology.  The kit approach offers  best value, yet meets A-10 and warfighter needs and provides the fastest  delivery of the propulsion upgrade at a significantly lower risk.  This  modification approach saves three to four (3-4) years over development. There is a proposed  FY06 target year to begin a three (3) year Systems Design  and Demonstration (SDD) effort ($160M budget). The modification kit purchases  must begin with adequate leadtime to support kit installations by early FY09,  which allows synchronization with planned TF34-100A overhaul schedule.   Acquisition planning factors include the following assumptions:  1) The  acquisition effort begins at Milestone B,  2) 356 A-10s will be modified, 3)  in addition, 68 spare engines will be modified.  The table below identifies  performance requirements for the upgraded TF34-100 engine. Capability	Threshold	Objective	Justification Operate from high density attitude airfields with militarily significant  payloads	A 47K lb A/OA-10 (DI of 7.75) operating on a 9000 foot runway  at 5,000 feet PA and 35 degrees C can lose an engine at rotation, jettison  stores (41.75K lbs remaining, DI of 3.62) and climb with the gear up and  failed engine wind milling and maintain a minimum rate of climb of 150 feet  per minute (FPM).	Same conditions but maintain a minimum climb rate of  500 FPM.	Allows safe operations with a militarily significant payload  in high DA expeditionary conditions; Enables significantly more worldwide basing options. 	A 47 K lb A/OA-10 (DI of 7.75) operating on a 9,000 foot runway at  5,000 feet PA and 35 degrees C must have a critical field length of less than  9,000 feet.	Same conditions but have a critical field length of less than  7,500 feet.	 Operate from austere expeditionary airfields	A 47K lb A/OA-10 (DI of 7.75)  operating on a 5,000 foot runway at 2,500 foot PA and 25 degrees C can lose an  engine at rotation, jettison stores (41.7 lbs remaining, DI of 3.62) and climb  with the gear up and failed engine wind milling and maintain a minimum rate of  climb of 150 FPM.	Same conditions but maintain a minimum climb rate of  500 FPM.	Allows forward basing of “Sandy” role aircraft with CSAR Task  Force; Enables rapid response to calls for CAS/CSAR; Minimizes sortie transit  times and maximizes employment; Allows more staging options for TST  operations; Allows staging closer to the ground forces for emergency/immediate  CAS.  	A 47K lb A/OA-10 (DI of 7.75) operating on an airfield at a 2,500 foot  PA and 25 degrees C must have a critical field length of less than 5,000 feet. 	Same conditions but have a critical field length of less than 4,500. Maximize gross weight on take-off (weapons and internal fuel)	Operate a 51K  lb A/OA-10 (DI of 14.49) on a 9,000 foot runway, sea level, standard day, be  able to lose an engine at rotation, jettison stores (41.6K lbs remaining, DI  of 3.62( and climb with the gear up and failed engine wind milling and  maintain a minimum rate of climb of 150 FPM.	Same conditions but operate on  a 7,500 foot runway.	Leverage PE Mod; Fully capitalize on available hard  points in the optimum conditions. TABLE: A-10/TF34 ENGINE UPGRADE REQUIREMENTS Key A-10 engine upgrade attributes include:  air to air refueling at higher  altitudes, reduced susceptibility to FOD, maintaining existing TF34  reliability, operating above the threat with a 500 FPM rate of climb on a  standard day at 20,000 feet, decreasing fuel flow, and reducing transit time.

Service delivery requirements, as dictated by the dynamics of the Government, may be expanded over the period of contract performance for new, improved or additional services, technological refreshment substitutes, or engineering changes. GSA, FTS, prefers Multiple Awards, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, Fixed Price, Performance-Based contracting for each state and city location.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM), Army Material Command and Fort Lewis, Washington, seek to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to possible privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority for Utility Privatization of the Electric and Water Distribution Utility Systems and Wastewater Collection System at Fort Lewis, Washington.  The potential privatization action will include transfer of ownership, operation and maintenance, and the obligation to serve.  The Army will not transfer ownership of land or any land lease interest for Fort Lewis, Washington and will grant easements and leases, with concurrence of the underlying leaseholder where applicable, for access to land associated with each utility system.  

INSTALLATION DESCRIPTION: Fort Lewis, one of the U.S. Army largest and most modern, consists of 87,000 acres located approximately 15 miles south of Tacoma, Washington. Founded in 1917, the Installation was named after Captain Meriwether Lewis, leader of the historic Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1803. Today, Fort Lewis is home to I Corps, 4th ROTC Region, 2nd Battalion, 7th Rangers, 1st Special Forces Group and Madigan Medical Center.    

A brief description and approximate size of each system is detailed as follows: 

Electrical Distribution System:

Fort Lewis currently purchases its electrical power requirements from the Tacoma City Utilities (TCU) through four (4) separate primary delivery points located within the Installation’s main cantonment area. All three (4) delivery points are supplied from TCU’s 110 kV Boise Cascade/Fort Lewis Loop transmission system. 

The Installation’s distribution system consists of four (4) 100 kV / 13.8 kV substations, 96.2 circuit miles of overhead (OH) primary distribution line and 52.1 circuit miles of underground (UG) primary distribution line. With regard to the four (4) substations, TCU owns the 110 kV switching, protective equipment and the power transformers and Fort Lewis owns the secondary structures, bus-works, voltage regulators and metal-clad switchgear. The primary distribution system consists of a total of twenty-one (21) 13.8 circuits. The majority of the distribution circuits are configured with loop tie switches to neighboring circuits. The distribution system is primarily OH conventional open wire pole-line construction with pole-mounted transformers. However, there is also a substantial amount of UG primary construction, utilizing duct type construction practices.
 
Water Treatment and Distribution System:

Fort Lewis’ potable water system includes eight (8) active, two (2) standby wells, the Sequalitchew Springs, a raw water pumping station, a WTP, a booster pump station, a pressure reducing station, an elevated storage tank, eleven (11) ground-level storage tanks and the water distribution lines. The raw water taken from the Sequalitchew Springs and the wells is chlorinated, fluoridated and a corrosion inhibitor is added before the water enters the distribution system. Fort Lewis redistributes the treated water throughout the Main Post, North Fort and Davis Hill service areas via 718,388 linear feet (136 miles) of asbestos cement, cast iron, ductile iron, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, ranging in size from less than 2 to 16-inches in diameter. The 500,000 gallon elevated storage tank was constructed in 1960 and repaired in 1979 and 1995. There are also eleven (11) ground-level storage tanks: one (1) 200,000 gallon tanks (constructed in 1949 and repaired in 1979 and 1995), five (5) 500,000 gallon tanks (constructed in 1949 and repaired in 1979), one (1) 500,000 gallon tank (constructed in 1965 and repaired in 1979), two (2) 750,000 gallon tanks (constructed in 1949 and repaired in 1979), and two (2) 840,000 gallon tanks (constructed in 1953 and repaired in 1979 and 1995).       

Wastewater Collection and Treatment System: 

Fort Lewis’ wastewater utility system includes 501,400 linear feet (95 miles) of underground wastewater collection lines, 1,674 manholes, 35 relatively small sewage life stations and a secondary wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The wastewater collection lines include vitrified clay, concrete or reinforced concrete, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, ranging in size from 4 to 36-inches in diameter. The wastewater is collected and conveyed primarily via the gravity system with the help of 35 relatively small sewage lift stations to the WWTP. On average, the 7.6 million gallon per day (MGD) WWTP treats 4.3 MGD of domestic and industrial wastewater collected from the Main Post, North Fort, Camp Murray, the VA Hospital, Clover Park Schools, McChord AFB, DuPont Village, Northwest Landing and Madigan Army Medical Center. Initially constructed in 1955 as a primary treatment facility, the WWTP was upgraded in 1974 to provide secondary treatment. Fort Lewis’ WTP includes two (2) mechanically cleaned bar screen, a grit chamber, four (4) primary clarifiers, two (2) trickling filters, (2) secondary clarifiers, three (3) anaerobic digestors, one (1) sludge thickener tank and sludge drying beds.

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition. The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM), Army Material Command and Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico, seek to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to possible privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, "Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority" for Utility Privatization of the Electric and Water Distribution Systems and Wastewater Collection Systems at Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico.  The potential privatization action will include transfer of ownership, operation and maintenance, and the obligation to serve.  The Army will not transfer ownership of land or any land lease interest for Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico and will grant easements and leases, with concurrence of the underlying leaseholder where applicable, for access to land associated with each utility system.  
 
OBJECTIVE:  Should privatization occur, the ownership of the Electric and Water Distribution Systems and Wastewater Collection System and equipment to include, all capital investments, operation, maintenance and repair responsibilities, shall transfer to a publicly or privately owned utility provider.  All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, operation, maintenance, major systems renovation, construction, equipment, manpower and overhead shall be the responsibility of the new owner.  Utility services under the potential contract will not include the commodity itself.  

INSTALLATION DESCRIPTION: Fort Buchanan is a U.S. Army Installation which covers approximately 746 acres located southwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico. First established in 1932, Fort Buchanan was named after Brigadier General James A. Buchanan, first commander of the Puerto Rican Regiment, U.S. Volunteers, which was formed in 1900. In 1997, the Installation became a sub-installation of U.S. Army South (USARSO). Today, Fort Buchanan provides administrative and logistical support to all active-duty and Reserve elements on the Island of Puerto Rico.

A brief description and approximate size of each system is detailed as follows: 

Electrical Distribution System:

Fort Buchanan owns its electrical distribution system located within the boundaries of the Installation. The Puerto Rico Power Authority (PREPA) supplies electrical power to the Installation from its Puerto Nuevo Steam Plant via PREPA’s 38 KV transmission line, designated as line # 3900. PREPA can also supply Fort Buchanan through its main transmission grid via its Caparra substation. Caparra is a 38 KV to 4160- volt substation, with designated lines # 3500 and # 4300 as well as # 3900 feeding into it. Fort Buchanan takes delivery of its electric power requirements through its main substation, which has two (2), three phase transformers; one rated 10 MVA and the other 7.5 MVA, at 38KV/ 13.2 KV but with the addition of forced air can be increased to 12.5 and 10 MVA respectively. The transformers contain no known PCBs. The main substation has a total capacity of 22.5 MVA, however when redundancy is considered, the capacity is reduced to 12.5 MVA.

In addition to the main substation, Fort Buchanan’s electrical distribution system consists of three (3), 13.2 kV three phase feeder lines (designated Black, Brown and Red) that provide primary distribution to the Installation. The distribution system is primarily overhead (OH), supported on wood and concrete poles, however there is some underground (UG) primary and secondary distribution, primarily for the housing area and for street lighting. The OH pole-line is conventional open wire grid with a length of 546,835 linear feet, (25.9 circuit miles). The existing system uses pole-mounted transformers and the majority is 20 + years old. The UG distribution system includes approximately 15,239 linear feet, (0.7 circuit miles) and was repaired / upgraded in September 2001. A small portion of UG primary construction utilizes duct type construction and pad-mounted transformers. The upgraded UG distribution system located within two of the four family housing areas is partially completed and has not yet been energized. 
 
Water Distribution System:

Fort Buchanan owns its water distribution system located within the boundaries of the Installation. The Installation purchases its potable water requirements from the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) and takes delivery of the potable water through its three interconnections with PRASA. The Installation’s primary interconnect is its 10-inch diameter cast iron pipe which is connected to a PRASA’s 30-inch diameter main supply line located near the East Gate. This 10-inch line feeds a booster pump station followed by meter to improve the pressure of the water supplied through PRASA’s 30-inch diameter line. The other two interconnections (connected to Fort Buchanan’s 6-inch and 10-inch diametere lines) are used when the pressure from the primary interconnection is not sufficient to provide adequate service to the Installation.
 
Constructed primarily in the mid-1950s, Fort Buchanan’s water distribution system consists of approximately 169,198 linear feet (32.0 miles) of potable water distribution lines and two ground-level concrete water storage tanks. The water distribution lines include cast iron, asbestos cement, galvanized iron, ductile iron, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, ranging in size from 2 inches to 30 inches in diameter. The Installation has two (2) ground-level concrete water storage tanks which supply the Installation’s maximum day and peak hour demands; one is a 500,000 gallon tank located on the north side of the Installation and the other is a 1.0 million-gallon (MG) tank located near the southern-most boundary. Although the 1.0 MG tanks is in good operating condition, the 500,000 gallon tank is out-of-service and under repair. Fort Buchanan does not maintain a separate non-potable water system for fire protection purposes.

Wastewater Collection System: 

Fort Buchanan also owns its wastewater collection system located within the boundaries of the Installation. Wastewater collected from the Installation is discharged into either PRASA’s Bayamon 42-inch diameter trunk sewer line or Tintillo 18-24-inch diameter trunk sewer line for delivery for treatment and disposal at PRASA’s sewage treatment facility. The Bayamon trunk line, which handles the majority of the wastewater collected on the Installation, traverses the northern half of the Installation in an east-to-west direction. The Tintillo trunk line, which parallels the El Toro Creek in a south-to-north direction, receives Installation wastewater from a few isolated points. The Tintillo trunk line primarily serves the Tintillo Development and other areas south of the Fort Buchanan perimeter. 

Constructed primarily in the mid-1950s, Fort Buchanan’s wastewater collection system consists of approximately 117,063 linear feet (22.2 miles) of wastewater collection lines and one (1) 500 gallon per minute lift station. The wastewater collection lines include vitrified clay; reinforce concrete, cast iron, and concrete pipe, ranging in size from 4 to 24-inch in diameter. Insituform Company restored all of the wastewater collection lines in 1994 by installing custom-manufactured polyester-fiber tubing that forms a seamless, joint-less, leak proof "pipe within a pipe”. The 500 gallon per minute lift station discharges into a force-main line on the Golf Club sub-basin area.

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition. The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement as an attachment to the Request For Proposal (RFP). The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. At this time, no solicitation exists: therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION. HOWEVER, BE ADVISED THAT A SOLICITATION ISSUANCE IS ANTICIPATED ON OR BEFORE March 31, 2005.

<DESC>RELAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL DATA FROM NOAA DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM PLATFORMS (DCPs) TO THE USERS

Category: Automatic Data Processing and Telecommunication Services

I.  INTRODUCTION.

This is a request for information (RFI) for planning purposes in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.215 3 (OCT 1997).  The purpose of this request is to solicit an expression of interest and potential capability for relaying environmental data emitted by local sensor platforms (moving as well as fixed) from worldwide locations to the data acquisition sites at (a) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NOAA/ NESDIS) Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) stations at Wallops, Virginia or Fairbanks, Alaska; or (b) the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility at Suitland, Maryland.

NOAA has broad interests in various approaches to data collection services, including partnerships, to provide some or all of the components of data collection, or the development of instrument technology to operate on United States spacecrafts.  As a bureau of the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), NOAA is interested in surveying the capability of industry, academia, or other interested organizations to relay environmental sensor data from fixed and mobile platforms throughout the world to its data collection systems processing facilities, noted above.  

NOAA does not intend to award a contract based on this information.  

II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION.

Currently NOAA/NESDIS operates two types of NOAA environmental satellites, POES and GOES, which carry transponders to relay environmental data from fixed moving and fixed surface platforms. NOAA will also operate the NPOESS series of satellites beginning in 2009 to replace the POES series of satellites.

(a) Polar orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) based Argos Data Collection and Location System:  The current Argos Data Collection System (DCS) platforms carry environmental sensors.  The platforms are both fixed and mobile and located throughout the world. The number of platforms in 2004 was about 12,000, and is expected to grow to nearly 100,000 by 2020.  These platforms are active and transmit signals containing environmental observation information (at 401.65 megahertz center frequency), which are received by NOAA POES satellite transponders when passing over the platforms.  The platform environmental observation data are downlinked by POES to local receiver stations.  The data received from the platforms for the entire orbit are stored onboard the satellite spacecraft, then downlinked to NOAA/NESDIS CDA stations, which deliver the data to the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility at Suitland, Maryland.  Data are then transmitted to Service Argos in Largo, MD.  The current Argos system operates in receive mode only.  The next generation Argos system will provide an interrogation function (465.9875 megahertz); meaning that the Argos DCS instrument onboard the satellite will include the capability to transmit commands to the platform.
 
(b) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) based Data Relay System:  The GOES DCS is limited to geostationary coverage areas.  The GOES DCS relays data from earth based platforms within the GOES coverage area/footprint; i.e., GOES East (75 degrees West) and GOES West (135 degrees West).  The number of platforms in 2004 was about 40,000, and expected to grow to nearly 160,000 by 2020.  These platforms are active and transmit environmental data collected by the platform's sensors, at frequencies of 401.7 402.0 megahertz at pre defined times.  The transponder on the GOES satellite receives this signal, and then relays it to  the Command and Data Acquisition station, at Wallops Island, Virginia.  The GOES DCS includes an interrogation capability, with the ability to relay commands from the Wallops CDA station to platforms, using several frequencies near 468.8 megahertz.  The functions of current ARGOS and GOES DCS systems can be found on the website at: http://noaasis.noaa.gov.  

(c) National Polar Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) (Launch C 1 2009):  NPOESS will continue the DCS capabilities and presents an opportunity to perform a technology refresh both on the space platform (receiver/transmitter and relay capability) and associated ground terminal users.  At full operational capability the NPOESS system will have three operational satellites populating three orbital planes with Local Times of Ascending Node of 1330, 1730, and 2130 Hours.  During the NPOESS era, NPOESS environmental data records will be available at the NOAA server within 28.3 minutes from observation, 95% of the time.  During the NPOESS era, consideration can be given to increase the capability of the DCS subsystem in several aspects: expanded frequency coverage (401 401.7 megahertz), larger message size (up to 25 megabytes) and data rates up to 32 kilobits per second.

III.  INFORMATION REQUESTED BY THE GOVERNMENT.
  
Interested parties are invited to provide information to help NOAA determine the interest in, and possible solutions and sources for some or all components of its Data Collection System.  NOAA requests that each interested party's response be limited to no more than 25 pages including (a) a 1 2 page summary of its products, services, history, ownership and other relevant information; (b) possible technical approaches to be used for environmental data relay; (c) the technical contact's phone number and e mail address; and (d) Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimated costs for any existing commercial services, as well as projected costs for commercial services that may be available in the 2010 2015 time frame.   Respondents are required to supply only a ROM cost for this service and, if possible, a ROM for the following: segmented end to end costs of supplying this service into any or all of the following components of the end to end service: (a) relay of data from the Data Collection Platforms to the data processing service; (b) the data processing service; (c) the delivery service of processed data to the users; and, (d) the customer service interface.  Responses should be submitted in via e mail with one electronic copy in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format and one hard copy using 82 x 11 paper, font size no smaller than 12 point.  The cover page of the response should include all contact information regarding the responder's organization (including type of business).  Please send the e mail to the technical point of contact (POC) with the contracting POC receiving both the e mail and the hard copy, as listed below:

<SUBJECT>Q -- PROPOSED TRICARE ACTIVE DUTY DENTAL PROGRAM (RFI)
<DESC>The Department of Defense is interested in contracting for processing and payment of Dental claims for Active Duty Service Members (ADSMs) residing within the United States and its territories. A potential offeror must tender its current nation-wide dental network of credentialed providers to the Program and its most favorable network fee schedule.  However, in remote locations, claims from non-network providers will be submitted for payment.  All claims will be preauthorized by Government personnel prior to payment who, it is anticipated, will also determine each ADSM’s eligibility. The dental benefit structure will be a full-spectrum of possible dental procedures; however, the contractor will pay claims based solely on the specified procedures in the authorizations and will make no benefit determinations. The contractor must be able to pay for a wide range of benefits, both routine and specialty care.  Authorizations may be received by fax or by other electronic means to be determined.  The contractor must have the ability to accept both ADA the versions of the paper claim form and the electronic formats to include the dental ANSI X12N 837.  Benefit payments will be drawn from an account established specifically for this program and the contractor will be given authority to draw funds into that bank account. The volume of dental claims paid for authorized civilian dental care in CY2004 was 158,866.  Please direct any questions you may have to this RFI to the POC's e-mail addresses listed below.

<SUBJECT>--Technology Information Exchange.  Request for Information.
<DESC>Training and Doctrine Command Futures Center Capabilities Development Directorate Science & Technology Division 10 Whistler Lane, Building 163, Room 201 Fort Monroe, Virginia 23651 TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION EXCHANGE-REQUEST FOR INFORMATION The United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Futures Center is initiating a Technology Information Exchange (TIE) program.  One aspect of this program is to establish dialogue with industry on its corporate/company Independent Research an d Development projects relating to identified Army Force Operating Capabilities (FOCs).  This program brings industry/corporate/company representatives together with the TRADOC Futures Center for a dialogue session on emerging technologies and desired Army  force capabilities.  Each TIE session is a distinct and separate presentation intended to facilitate a discussion between industry and the Futures Center at the executive level on a companys independent research and development projects.  A General Offic er or equivalent from the Futures Center will host each session and the intent is to provide input to help industry focus their R&D programs (without any financial reimbursement) towards existing and future Army capabilities, to the benefit of both industr y and the U.S. Army. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION but is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 15.201(b), TRADOC, Futures Center will use the responses to the RFI to determine what emerging technologies are available in the market place.  RFIs are used to gather  information from industry without any promise of a current or future contract or requirement.  This is not a request for contractual offers and information provided cannot be used to create a binding contract.  Respondents to RFIs will not be reimbursed f or the information they provide to the Futures Center.  This is not a request for companies that may be able to conduct research but is a request for information from companies already conducting independent research and development in relevant areas.  Onl y companies with demonstrated success in their independent R&D programs to address Department of Defense war fighting capabilities are requested to respond. TRADOC Pamphlet 525-66 is the base document that describes the war fighting objective capabilities that the Army desires in its current to future force.  The capability areas are:  Strategic Responsiveness and Deployability, Battle Command, Sensor Fusion, Mounted/Dismounted Maneuver, Non-Line of Sight Lethality/Networked Fires, Line of Sight/Beyond Line of Sight Lethality, Maneuver Support, Maneuver Sustainment, Air/Ground Operations, Survivability, Training and Leader Development, and Human Engineering. A detailed description of each Force Operating Capability can be obtained by accessing the TRADOC Web site using the following instructions:  1.  Go to http://www.TRADOC.army.mil/index.html 2.  On the left hand side of the page CLICK on the Publications button. 3.  Once the page opens look for the section titled TRADOC Publications, CLICK on       the Administrative Publications button. 4.  Once the page opens titled TRADOC Command and Administrative Publications,      CLICK on the Pamphlets button. 5.	Once the page opens scroll down to 525-66 and CLICK on the PDF or DOC button on the right to download. Additional information may be available after coordination with the TIE coordinator (listed below) and verification of an active Industrial Security Program with the USG. When responding to this Request For Information provide a brief description and depth of the company independent R&D program, a brief description (one page) of past R&D success satisfying DOD capability needs, a brief description (one to two pages) on each  of the R&D programs/projects that apply directly to Army Force Operating Capabilities, and points of contact list for further coordination if necessary.  Based on the information provided, your c ompany may be selected to attend a Technology Information Exchange hosted by the TRADOC Futures Center to address specific issues within your independent R&D program.

<DESC>Request for Information  

“Interoperability problems in the capital facilities industry stem from the highly fragmented nature of the industry, the industry’s continued paper-based business practices, a lack of standardization, and inconsistent technology adoption among stakeholders.  Based on interviews and surveys it is found that $15.8 billion in annual interoperability costs were quantified for the capital facilities industry in 2002.  Of these costs, two-thirds are borne by owners and operators, which incur most of these costs during ongoing facility operation and maintenance (O&M).”  

The United States General Services Administration (GSA) / Public Buildings Service (PBS) is seeking information from industry partners on Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) -Based, Integrated and Interoperable Building Information Model (BIM) technology as part of its effort to improve project deliveries in the capital construction program.  The GSA/PBS currently has an active pipeline of more than 200 major capital construction projects conclusively exceeding a value of eleven (11) billion United States dollars. 

In December of 2003, the GSA/PBS issued internal guidance to its regional staff stressing the need to focus on on-time and under budget deliveries of projects in the capital construction program, with specific initiatives to improve each project's definition and execution processes.  New and emerging technologies such as 3D/4D and Building Information Models, according to this guidance, have the potential to dramatically improve the outcome of projects and enhance customer satisfaction.  

During 2004, several industry milestones have further supported the GSA/PBS’s resolve:

•	The publication of The Construction Users Roundtable (CURT) A/E Productivity Task Force Report which strongly encourages the use of virtual modeling as a keystone to improved A/E design delivery.  Information pertaining to CURT may be viewed at their website, http://www.curt.org/.  

•	The publication of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Study on the "Cost Analysis of Inadequate Interoperability in the U.S. Capital Facilities Industry." Information pertaining to this study may be viewed at the NIST website, http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/oae/publications/gcrs/04867.pdf. 

On-going engagement between the GSA/PBS and numerous industry partners and organizations on this issue include :  The American Institute of Architects (AIA), Construction Users Roundtable (CURT), Construction Specifications Institute (CSI), Construction Management Association of America (CMAA), Association of General Contractors (AGC), Civil Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Federal Facilities Council (FFC), Stanford Center for Integrated Facilities Engineering (CIFE), the Open Standards for Commercial Real Estate (OSCRE) , FIATECH, the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS), and the International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI). 

The General Services Administration/Public Buildings Service, National Capital Region, Washington, DC announces an opportunity for firms in the design, construction, facility management, and real property industries to submit information on the use of IFC-BIM Technology.  This information will be utilized to assist the government in establishing potential sources in the marketplace with knowledge and experience in the use and practices of this state-of-the-art technology.  This is not a solicitation or request for specific proposals.  
 
For each submission, provide at a minimum, the below listed information in the following format:

I:  	Name of Company or Organization, Contact Name, phone number and email address, Description of product or service, product literature or other information, and expressions of interest.
II:	Include examples of best practices, case studies, white papers, published articles, PowerPoint or multimedia presentations, and identify any software packages.
III:	Identify architecture, consulting, construction management and construction professional organizations, firms, and individuals that are currently involved in or with corporate and organizational strategies supporting and promoting this new paradigm.
IV:	Identify any improved business processes, integrated decision making practices, and collaborative design processes that have been established as a result of this technology.
V:	List all known BIM contracting specifications.
VI:	Any other beneficial information.

All information submitted must be in the public domain and not proprietary or otherwise business confidential.  The GSA/PBS may, at its sole discretion, request additional information from items submitted and review and publish the information as a body of knowledge on a publicly Accessible website. Submit all information by email or with word, PDF, PowerPoint, URLs, or other attachments no later than March 15, 2005 to: ifc.bim@gsa.gov. Any questions regarding this request for information may also be submitted to the same email address.
