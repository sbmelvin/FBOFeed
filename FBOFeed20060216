<CONTACT>Sherry L. Gasaway, Contracting Officer, Phone (321) 867-5294, Fax (321) 867-1166, Email sherry.l.gasaway@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA’s Kennedy Space Center (KSC) plans to issue a request for proposals resulting in the award of multiple Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) general construction contracts to support construction, alteration, and repair of NASA buildings, structures, and other real property located at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), and other locations near KSC and CCAFS.  These multiple general construction contracts will provide NASA/KSC the capability to compete selected quick turn-around construction projects amongst a group of highly qualified general construction contractors for a five year period.  Selection of this group of general construction contractors will be based on best value trade-offs between relevant experience/past performance and price factors with relevant experience/past performance being significantly more important than price.  Each IDIQ contract will have a minimum value of $10,000 which represents the minimum value of work the Government is required to order under each IDIQ contract.  The maximum contract value of each IDIQ contract and the maximum value of all IDIQ contracts will be $400 million.   The acquisition process will include the issuance of a DRAFT request for proposal (RFP) inviting comments from potential offerors on all aspects of the DRAFT RFP, including the requirements, schedules, proposal instructions, and evaluation approaches.  The anticipated release date of the DRAFT RFP is not earlier than March 03, 2006. The RFP will include specifications and drawings for a task order envisioned to be awarded to one of the selected IDIQ contractors. The task order will be representative in nature of the tasks to be ordered under the proposed IDIQ general construction contracts.  Offerors will be required to submit a price proposal for the task order as part of its proposal for the IDIQ contracts.  Offerors will be provided a tour of the site where the model task order will be performed. Future task orders will be competed amongst all of the general construction IDIQ contractors unless one of the statutory exceptions in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b) (2) applies.  The task order placement process will provide primarily for a “sealed bid” type process where low price wins; however, the task ordering procedures will allow the contracting officer to consider past performance on earlier orders under the contract (including quality and timeliness), past performance on other relevant and recent projects, potential impact on other orders placed with the contractor, and minimum order requirements when making task order award. The performance periods for task orders will vary depending on the scope, urgency of the project, and other applicable factors as determined during the design phase of the projects.  The specific projects to be ordered will be detailed in construction drawings and specifications (unless a design-build project is contemplated in which case a statement of work will be provided) as attachments to task order solicitations.   This acquisition will be conducted under full and open competition procedures allowing maximum participation from large and small businesses. This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement is 236220 and $31 million, respectively.  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The DRAFT and FINAL solicitations and any documents related to this procurement [with the exception of the specifications and drawings] will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/KSC Business Opportunities page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=76  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the DRAFT and FINAL solicitations and amendments (if any).	Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitations and amendments (if any).  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the URLs linked below. All contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing.  Telephone questions will not be accepted.

Vendors will be expected to have experience creating and maintaining a such a system for an agency or organization similar to the NCCS.  

We are only interested in seeing proposals for proven and existing systems.  The proposed system may be adapted to meet our specific needs.  

If you are interested in receiving the solicitation please send an email to the undersigned.  

besancenezwr@ornl.gov 


If there are any questions please send an email or phone at 865-576-1538.

NCCS Proposal Management System Requirements

NCCS
The National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory provides unique, world-class scientific computing resources to Department of Energy Office of Science (DOE-SC) researchers in national laboratories, universities, and industry. The DOE-SC seeks high priority, high payoff computationally intensive experiments, where the capability of the NCCS systems can enable new breakthroughs in science and enable the DOE-SC to be "first to market" with important scientific and technological capabilities, ideas, and software.

Access to the NCCS resources is made available through a proposal process, whereby requests from scientists for accounts on existing projects, or, allocations of computer time for new projects, are submitted electronically and routed to the appropriate reviewers and staff members. Requests are received on a continuing basis, although specific calls-for-proposals (solicitations) are issued periodically.

Management Software System Desired
The NCCS seeks a web-based proposal management system to electronically manage requests from researchers for access to the NCCS resources, from solicitation to close out when the research is completed.  The proposal management system should include the following functionality:

1- Integrated Problems-Solutions Database
The system should support the storage and retrieval of data in a relational database.  Open source databases such as MySQL are preferred; however, other third party databases such as Oracle will be considered.  All data, including databases and login information, that is considered proprietary information should be designated as such by the owner of such data.  Such designation should be such as to clearly convey to each individual accessing such data the proprietary nature of such data and the obligation of confidentiality associated with such access.  The system’s security measures should have the ability to control access to the data of each owner in order to protect such data in all stages of its lifetime, including entry, storage and retrieval.

The system and database will be hosted on a Unix based operating system.

Data back up and system failover must be supported.

The proposed software must interact with the local Resource Allocation and Management System infrastructure.  This tool is a MySQL-based resource accounting system.  Resources tracked include CPU-hours, memory, or disk usage.  The system must have the ability to export data (i.e. flat files, .sql script files) that can be utilized by the Resource Allocation and Management System.  The system should have the ability to meet these and other similar needs.

2- Proposal Solicitation:
The system should have the ability to display online solicitations for proposals, and to send defined groups solicitations in the form of email via the system.  Solicitations should be viewable to the general public via the web without the need to obtain an account on or log into the system.  Solicitation emails and responses to these emails should be stored and logged. Solicitations for proposals will be announced at least once a year and will be modified to correspond with the current strategic direction of the facility.

The system must include a web based interface (e.g. web site), where the following activities are supported, based on login roles:

3- Proposal Submission:
The system should support role based login access restrictions.  Researchers (internal and external to Oak Ridge National Laboratory) and NCCS staff should be able to log into the system using LDAP or SecurID for authentication.  New researchers should be given the opportunity to create a new login account after providing the web site’s required information.  Returning researchers should be allowed to login using the previously created login account.  The system should also support the (re)setting of passwords.

Upon successful login researchers should have the ability to initiate one or more new proposals, modify an existing proposal, or submit a completed proposal for review.  Each proposal will be composed of discrete sections comprised of check boxes, radio buttons, pull down menus and text fields.  The system should also support importing documents of various types (ex. Plain text, Microsoft Word, PDF, JPG, TIFF).  Select staff should have the ability to edit the proposal forms.  Researchers should have the ability to save an incomplete proposal and return at a later time to complete the proposal.  An edit and creation timeframe window can be set for each proposal.  The researcher will not have the ability to edit an existing proposal or create a new proposal outside of this timeframe.

The multiple groups of staff and researchers, and their roles in terms of level of access, should be definable and modifiable by NCCS staff members.  The system should have the ability to automatically and manually notify varying groups of predefined staff and researchers throughout the proposal’s lifecycle.  Notification may be done through email and by flagging an account.  The notification email’s subject and body should be definable and have the ability to contain all or a subset of a proposal.  The system should support multiple definitions of predefined notification emails.  Automatic notifications to selected groups should occur upon action, at defined times, or at a set limit of inaction throughout the proposal’s lifecycle.  Notifications will be dynamic reminders of actions needed or pre-set report/data distribution.  Proposal lifecycle actions may include, saving of a proposal, submitting a proposal, proposal review, or denying or approving a proposal.

4- Review and Selection:
Once a proposal has been submitted it will go through a series of review stages conducted by multiple groups.  The proposal system should automatically notify predefined review groups that a proposal is awaiting their review.  The review groups may change at various stages in the proposal’s review life cycle.  Each reviewer should have the ability to log into the proposal system and review proposals for which they have been given permission to review.  Reviewers should only be able to view proposals for which they have been given permission.

Each proposal will go through multiple review stages.  Review stages may be independent of or dependant on other review stages.  Multiple simultaneous review stages should be supported as well as the ability to lock the review process to a single review stage for set stages.  Each review stage will be composed of multiple forms.  Each form will be comprised of check boxes, radio buttons, pull down menus and text boxes as well as numeric ranking for multiple sections.  The proposal system should have the ability to produce a report for each review stage and for the review as a whole.  The report should include calculated rankings based on the given numeric rankings and concatenated text comments.

5- Negotiation and Award:
Upon completion of the review process the proposal will be approved or denied by a single role that has the appropriate approve/deny role permissions.  The approve/deny role may consist of one staff member or a committee and may vary based on proposal solicitation type.  If the proposal is denied the system should notify the researcher and select staff groups.  No further action is required.  If approved, the system should have the ability to store allocation and access data.  This data should be emailed to the researcher and select staff groups.  The system should also create a text file including the allocation, access, and researcher data gathered during the account creation.

6- Administration:
Select NCCS staff members will have the ability to access and edit all areas of the system including the database and all comprising forms, email templates, and code.  Staff members shall only edit the system database by making: (1) non-substantive format and organizational changes to the system database or (2) substantive changes to those third-party databases incorporated and contained within the system database as expressly requested by the respective owners of such third-party databases.

7- Closeout and Reports:
The system should allow the researcher to log in and enter a research summary or lists of publications resulting from their research.  At set periods throughout the fiscal year the system should request a summary from the researcher via email.  The system should track each request and response including times.  Predefined groups should be notified each time a notification was sent or received.  

The system should have the ability to create numerical and graphical reports.  Reports may be obtained by logging into the system or via email.  The system should also have the ability to automatically generate reports at set times.  Select groups should also have the ability to pull raw data in a format that may be imported into a reporting tool.  Examples of reports may include, but are not limited to: hours allocated by proposal and by system, and researcher notification times and response times.  At-a-glance reports showing status of proposals within their lifecycle would also be desirable. Access to each report should be limited based on researcher and staff roles. NCCS staff must be able to create new report types within a 24-hour time frame.
8- Post-Closeout:
Once the researcher has completed the closeout the system should automatically notify via email predefined staff groups.  After review, selected staff members should have the ability to move the proposal from an active state to an inactive closed state.

<DESC>The Department of Treasury’s Bureau of the Public Debt intends to issue a solicitation for website architectural mapping services and quality assessment on behalf of the Federal Consulting Group (FCG).  The Information Technology service being solicited is unique.  We are looking for a website management tool that provides architectural mapping and reporting services which include analysis of content, data collection regarding users, and reporting capabilities.  The architectural mapping technology must capture and visualize websites accurately.  Methods using hierarchical approaches or thematic representations may be mathematically flawed and cannot be considered.  Genuine architectural mapping captures and visualizes the three-dimensional characteristics that are the essence of the worldwide web.  Using an appropriate architectural map, agencies can then correctly understand their websites’ quality, structure, and online processes.  The contractors need to provide solutions that combine website structure, content and traffic into one searchable database.  This procurement is set-aside for small business competition only.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this solicitation is 511210 and the Small Business Size Standard is $23.0 million.  The resulting contract will be a firm-fixed-price, performance-based contract with an estimated total amount of $9.4 million.  The period of performance will be a base year and four option years.  
 
Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list. Therefore, we recommend that you monitor the FedBizOpps site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions. If the Internet option is not available to you, you may receive a hard copy of the solicitation and any amendments (via U.S. Mail) by faxing your request to (304) 480-7203 or e-mailing your request to procurement@bpd.treas.gov.

<DESC>1.  The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), Special Projects Directorate at Lackland AFB, TX is soliciting your comments in response to several questions below.  This RFI is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.<br> <br> 2.  CPSG is developing a new generation of TT&C cryptographic devices to meet the needs of national security space programs and the Cryptographic Modernization (CM) program.  These new devices will be used to protect satellite and ground station command uplinks and telemetry downlinks from disruption or exploitation by non-authorized parties.   The Cryptologic Systems Group's Special Projects Directorate (CPSG/ZJ) is the developing program office assigned with the task of acquiring these cryptographic devices to support the modernization of Space TT&C for both satellite and ground control stations. <br> <br> 3.  CPSG intends to award a single contract to modify an existing Crypto-Modernized terrestrial re-programmable COMSEC product, with an option for production.  This modified COMSEC product will be used to replace existing/legacy Ground Operating Equipment (GOE) as well as a near term solution for new satellite ground stations.  The modified End Cryptographic Unit (ECU) will replace legacy GOE that implements the KG 28/46, KG-29/57, KI-23, CARDHOLDER, and BELSHAZZAR algorithms.  In order to meet the requirement of new ground stations the ECU will need to provide higher data rates and modern cryptographic features.  The final ECU will be NSA Type 1 certified. <br> <br> 4.  Please provide answers to the following questions. Your responses will be used in market research for this acquisition.  Please send responses via email no later than 6 Mar 2006 to:  jeffrey.hardin@lackland.af.mil<br> <br> a.  Hardware/Software Maintenance/Support Concept:  Based on a last operational need date of 2024, which of the product support concepts listed below would you recommend the Government choose to support these devices?  What is your rationale for the recommendation?  What is your current maintenance concept for other customers of this device?  Would you be capable of providing a realistic cost estimate for each of the product support concepts listed below at the time of the solicitation? <br>    	(1)  Total contractor support (warranty periods, post-warranty costs) <br> (2)  Interim contractor support with a 3-year minimum followed by Government organic support (e.g., tech manuals, training, support equipment, etc.) <br> 	(3)  Private-Public Partnership<br> 	(4)  Other recommendations<br> <br> b. Contract type:  The Government is considering awarding a cost plus incentive fee (CPIF) for the SD&D effort.  What areas of the contract would you recommend incentivizing other than cost? <br> <br> c. Command Authentication:  Please describe any experience you have with implementing algorithms or designing equipment with command authentication. <br> <br> d. Capability Maturity Model:  The following is proposed language for the solicitation.  Would this criterion be difficult for your company to meet? <br> <br> "As a minimum, the offeror must be appraised CMMI-SW Version 1.1 or later (Staged) Maturity Level III, by an SEI-authorized third party appraiser, for the specific subsidiary and division of the company (whether it be prime or subcontractor) proposing to perform the software effort.  It is desirable for the offeror to be appraised CMMI-SW Version 1.1 or later (Staged) Maturity Level IV or higher, by an SEI-authorized third party appraiser, for the specific subsidiary and division of the company (whether it be prime or subcontractor) proposing to perform the software effort.  It is also desirable for the prime contractor to be appraised CMMI-SE/SW Version 1.1 or later (Staged) Maturity Level III or higher, by an SEI-authorized third party appraiser." <br> <br> e. Production Capacity:  The Government is considering acquiring a maximum of 3,000 units over a 3-year period.  Can you support this production rate?  What challenges would you anticipate?  What is the minimum lead time to production and delivery of the first unit?  If longer than 90 days, please briefly elaborate.  What is your surge capability?  Any limiting factors related to surge capacity? <br> <br> f. Device Reliability:  Please state the reliability rates of the devices you currently produce, i.e., MTBF, MTTR, and MTTF. <br> <br> g.  Production Quality:  What QA/QC processes are you third-party appraised to ensure production quality (e.g., ISO 9000, IEEE 127 series, etc.)? <br> <br> h.  Data Rights:  Based upon the current acquisition strategy, what data rights will be available to the Government? <br> <br>  See Note 26.

<DESC>This procurement is set-aside for eligible Section 8(a) firms pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) §19.805, Competitive 8(a).   Joint ventures must meet the requirements of 13 CFR §124.513 to compete for these 8(a) competitive procurements and must be approved by SBA prior to award of any resulting contract.  SBA’s mentor-protégé program allows an 8(a) firm to serve as the protégé and an experienced firm to serve as the mentor.  Candidate mentor firms may include large business prime contractors.  Under SBA’s mentor-protégé program, a mentor and protégé may joint venture (not merely team or have a prime contractor/subcontractor relationship) and be considered small for any federal procurement if the 8(a) firm meets the definition of small for the NAICS code assigned to the project.  FAR clause 52.219-14 “Limitations on Subcontracting” applies to all 8(a) contracts and specifies that the 8(a) firm must perform a certain percentage of the work with its own resources.  The joint venture must perform the applicable percentage of work required and the 8(a) partner to the joint venture must perform a significant portion of the contract.  In joint ventures under the SBA’s mentor-protégé program, the contents of the joint venture are specified by SBA and the agreement must be fair and equitable.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The small business size standard is $30 million.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is authorized by the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. §§5121 et seq.)(Stafford Act), to provide assistance to applicants of Presidentially-declared disasters and emergencies.  FEMA’s Individual Assistance (IA) Program provides temporary housing assistance to disaster applicants in accordance with the Act.  In order to accomplish its mission, FEMA requires nationwide Individual Assistance-Technical Assistance Contract (IA-TAC) services, to include but not limited to, the following tasks: (1)  Site Assessment for potential group sites related to placement of temporary housing; (2)  Site Inspections for potential placement of temporary housing on applicants property; (3)  Staging area support for temporary housing units; (4) Installation of temporary housing units; (5)  Maintenance of temporary housing units; (6)  Deactivation of temporary housing units; (7) Group site design for building and placement of temporary housing units; (8) General construction services (e.g. temporary housing of disaster workers or applicants, refurbishment of existing housing units to make habitable); (9)  Facility Management (e.g. manage Disaster Recovery Centers); (10)  Housing Strategy Support (e.g. gather, analyze, issue recommendations related to short, medium and long term housing solutions); (11) Technical Support Staff (e.g. assist in the identification of housing needs/solutions – Pre-placement interviews, Preliminary Damage Assessments, registration of applicants at DRCs or other field offices, etc…).  The period of performance will be five years from date of award.  FEMA intends to award resulting Section 8(a) competitive, Performance Based, Fixed Unit Price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), multiple award contracts.  FEMA anticipates that approximately four (4) contracts will be awarded.  The maximum value of each contract will not exceed $1,250,000,000 ($250 million per year).

The NAICS code is 33!  4519 and the Small Business Standard is 500 Employees.  The proposed action is for commercial supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.5(a)(1)(ii).  This is a sole source action with Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc, Bellevue, WA, due to the following unique, critical features and usage.  The instruments will be used in shallow water acoustic propagation experiments on the Continental slope and shelf off the New Jersey coast.  Instruments will provide critical information about the spatial and temporal evolution of internal waves.  Experiments are for both research and education purposes.  The datastream from Sea-Bird Electronic Instruments is fully compatible with acquisition hardware and software data acquisition and processing systems currently being used for processing and interpreting observations.  The use of other instruments would require a complete rebuild of both systems at considerable extra co!  st to the government, with no gain in system performance.  The data pr ocessing software is proprietary to Sea-Bird Electronics and results in a superior data quality compared to other manufacturers and techniques.

The items being procured are various components of the Air Booster Pump Assembly (ABPA) and the High Pres!  sure Filter Assembly (HPFA).  The HPFA is bulkhead mounted and hard piped into the ship's high pressure service line via a bulkhead union in the top back center of the HPFA.  Air flows through the bulkhead fitting to a tee which directs the air to either (1) the drive air QD nipple and in-line filter ready for discharge to the ABPA or (2) to the HPFA filters.  The ABPA are used to charge high-pressure air into breathing air systems aboard US Navy ships.   Only AFST can provide the required parts because the APBA and the HPFA form highly specialized life support systems under the NAVSEA Diving Certification Authority.  Only those articles which have been successfully tested are qualified.  Procedures are specified under SS521-AA-MAN-010 U.S. Navy Diving and Manned Hyperbaric Certification Manual.  The objective of this process is to verify that the life support and damage control systems provides acceptable levels of safety throughout the specified operating range.  The inte!  nt of the process is to provide maximum reasonable assurance that an a ccident will not occur and establishes maximum reasonable assurance that U.S. Navy personnel may be recovered without injury if there is an accident. AFST is the only source available that is certified to provide these required components for the ABPA and the HPFA. Award will be based on the written quotation. These parts will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government. An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. On the heels of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, signs of a possible pandemic have emerged in Southeast Asia, as lethal infections of poultry and humans with avian influenza virus H5N1 continue and this virus is now endemic in bird populations, which increase the likelihood of continued human exposure.

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Although domestic vaccine supply and usage has gradually risen over the past decade and incremental expansion of domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity is anticipated over the next decade, private sector investment in surge capacity to meet the vaccine requirement in a pandemic is unlikely. 
       
One means to increase vaccine capacity is to increase the yield of vaccine product incrementally at various stages in the vaccine manufacturing process. Further modifications of present influenza vaccine manufacturing processes may be productive in increasing product stability. Taken together these improvements could have positive impacts on surge capacity during times of vaccine shortage and in the event of an influenza pandemic. 
       
The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple contract awards to improve the manufacturing process of influenza vaccines to achieve greater product yields and potentially shorter production cycles. Contracts will be awarded to influenza vaccine manufacturers or their corporate partners, which have vaccine manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. and which plan and implement a coordinated and integrated systematic strategy to enhance influenza vaccine manufacturing. The vaccine manufacturing activities that may be pursued include raw material selection and qualification, upstream processing, downstream processing, vaccine formulation, and final product presentation. Other activities supported by this RFP include manufacturing, clinical evaluation, and validation of pilot investigational and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccines manufactured by the improved processes. 

Eligibility requirements of vaccine manufacturers for these contracts include the following: (1) Licensure and manufacturing of vaccines for human usage; (2) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing, clinical development, and FDA-licensure of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage in the U.S. market; and (3) Documented development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 
       
The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to expand the domestic influenza vaccine capacity for seasonal and pandemic influenza. The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three years or 36 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-07 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about April 1, 2005. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26. All responses should be identified with RFP No. DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-07, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice. Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date of September 2005.

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government.  An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. On the heels of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, signs of a possible pandemic have emerged in Southeast Asia, as lethal infections of poultry and humans with avian influenza virus H5N1 continue and this virus is now endemic in bird populations, which increase the likelihood of continued human exposure.

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Currently, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines are comprised of 15 ìg of hemagglutinin (HA) for each included virus strain and are administered intramuscularly. Studies recently have shown that antigen sparing effects have been elicited for monovalent influenza vaccines formulated with adjuvants and trivalent influenza vaccines administered intradermally. Antigen sparing approaches may increase overall influenza vaccine capacity in the short term by reducing the amount of HA antigen that may be needed in the vaccine by using adjuvants or by administering vaccines by alternate routes such as intradermally.   

The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to develop medical devices and/or domestically- manufactured antigen sparing influenza vaccines for FDA licensure and human usage.  The scope of activities for which the Offeror may request funds may include manufacturing and clinical evaluation of pilot and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccine using adjuvants or other immune enhancing substances. Funds may be used also for vaccine and medical device development and testing. 

Contracts will be awarded to companies or their corporate partners that have U.S. manufacturing facilities available for influenza vaccines, adjuvants, and/or medical devices, which may afford an antigen sparing effect. Other eligibility requirements of manufacturers and their corporate partners, if applicable, for these contracts include the following: (1) Documented history of development and clinical testing of vaccines, adjuvants, or medical devices for human usage; (2) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing and clinical development leading toward FDA-licensure of pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage; and (3) Documented comprehensive development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 

	The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to facilitate late stage development and testing leading toward FDA-licensure of new antigen sparing influenza vaccines in U.S.-based manufacturing facilities.  The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three years or 36 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation.  RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-08 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about April 1, 2005.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.

<CONTACT>Sarah J. Welch Contract Specialist 360873459011   Sarah_Welch@nps.gov;
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This contract is for excavation, data recovery, and documentation of two archeological sites on Ross Lake, during maximum reservoir drawdown, approximately April and May, 2006.  The contractor will employ surface mapping of artifacts (including collection of formed or culturally and chronologically-sensitive types), site mapping, excavation of shovel or test probes, excavation of stratigraphy trenches and pits, and full-scale excavation using 1x1 and 2x2 m square excavation units, as needed to perform data recovery.   The contractor will employ standard laboratory and analytic techniques used to describe, identify, and classify archeological collections.  An inventory will be prepared of all artifacts recovered from excavation units, their provenience, class or artifact category, age assessment, and context (in situ or disturbed).  Laboratory methods, like field methods, must be clearly described and their results clearly presented, along with archeological interpretations of the data that address issues and objectives of the research design.  The contractor is strongly encouraged to seek qualified field workers among members of the three Skagit River tribes, to the extent possible.  At the contractor's request, NPS staff will provide contact information for each of the tribes, which include the Sauk-Suiattle, Swinomish, and Upper Skagit.  The annual exposure of both sites to the erosive effects of reservoir shoreline processes may have altered site conditions since original field testing 1989-1990.  These two sites, located high in the reservoir, may be particularly susceptible to reservoir effects, lending an urgency to the proposed excavations.  No pre-contact period human burials, gravesites, ceremonial features, or sacred objects have been recorded or reported the project area or within the park boundaries.  The historic gravesite of John McMillan is located far to the south of this project area. LOCATION:  The project area is located near Hozomeen campground in Ross Lake National Recreation Area, eastern Whatcom County, Washington, on lands managed by the National Park Service.  It is comprised of the exposed and devegetated reservoir bottom lands ("drawdown zone"), where reservoir sediments and eroded soils are exposed to air for a short time each year.  Vehicle access is easiest from the north, through British Columbia.  This requires travel up the Fraser River valley to the town of Hope, B.C., then south for ~45 miles following the gravel Silverhope-Klesilkwa Road to the northern end of Ross Lake.   SOLICITATION DETAILS:  This is a best value procurement open to small business concerns.  The NAICS code for this project is 541720 and the small business size standard is $6 million.  The electronic Request for Quotations will be available on approximately March 6, 2006, at www.fedbizopps.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov. In order to download the solicitation, interested vendors must register at  http://ideasec.nbc.gov and maintain an active registration at http://www.ccr.gov.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.

<DESC>The contract requires contractor to thin timber stands, remove designated hazard trees, and treat activity fuels (slash) to reduce the potential of high intensity wildfires.  All thinned material shall be masticated, lopped or piled on site.  Project area is approximately 265 acres on the Espanola Ranger District, Santa Fe National Forest.  The planned treatment is on slopes that are generally less than 30 percent; however, there are inclusions that are up to 50 percent.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement only.  This synopsis is issued for the sole purpose of the 55th Contracting Squadron to conduct Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10.  

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:  This effort is to seek qualified sources capable of providing engineering and technical services for maintenance and  development of enhancements to the Air Vehicle Planning System (APS) application for United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), Mobile Consolidated Command Center (MCCC), and DET 1, 608TH Air Operations Group (AOG).  APS is an air vehicle mission-planning tool with a graphical user interface and database (i.e. uses USSTRATCOM’s Enterprise Database (EDB)) capable of planning the air vehicle missions supporting USSTRATCOM and United States Air Force missions.  A sample of the air vehicles included are the B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers; KC-135 and KC-10 tankers; U-2, EP-3, and RC-135C reconnaissance aircraft; Dual-Capable F-15 and F-16 aircraft; Air Launched Cruise Missiles; Advanced Cruise Missiles; and Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missiles.  APS’ approximate 6.5 million lines of software code have been developed in languages such as FORTRAN, C, and C++.  The size of the database is approximately one terabyte.  APS provides interactive graphical displays supporting air vehicle routing; route conflict resolutions, reconnaissance objective acquisition analysis, threat and weapon effect analysis, and timing plan development.  APS interfaces with the Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS), Mission Data Planning System (MDPS), and other USSTRATCOM and/or Joint systems.  The possible (or potential) enhancements are not limited to the following: improvement by modernizing and upgrading the software per the USSTRATCOM System and Technical Architecture Documents; migration toward a thin client environment; support for Theater Planning; EDB updates; re-engineering to reduce legacy languages (i.e. PL/1); improve performance of the application; modernization and integration with other Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) Sub-Systems, transition planning functions to other DoD systems (i.e. Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS)) and increase inter-operability with current and future mission planning systems. Contractor personnel who work on APS must posses and maintain a favorable SSBI within the past five years for TOP SECRET and specific SAR clearances and be cleared for SIOP/ESI and Special Compartmentalized Information (SCI) access.  The contractor must possess and maintain a TOP SECRET and Special Access Required (SAR) facility clearance with storage capacity for TOP SECRET and SAR documents and equipment.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<RESPDATE>030306
<ARCHDATE>03182006
<CONTACT>Melvin Fondue, Purchasing Agent, Phone (206) 526-6043, Fax (206) 526-6025, Email melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov
<DESC>This requirement is being procured and an award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located is Seattle, WA intends to procure on a sole source basis with Eco Logical Research, Inc for Implement and test a sampling methodology used to estimate stream benthic and drift macroinvertebrate abundance and develop a metric of food availability for stream rearing salmonids for a period of one (1) year from date of award with and option for one (1) additional year.

Background and Objective -- The Center provides scientific and technical support to NMFS for the management, conservation, and wise-use of the Northwest region’s marine and anadromous resources.  
		To address some of these needs the Conservation Biology Division formed the Mathematical Biology and Systems Monitoring Program to develop, in tandem with the existing Salmon Science Programs and Salmon Recovery Planning Teams, quantitative tools for assessing population and habitat status and recovery potential and progress.  One of the major projects undertaken by this program is the development of a large-scale comprehensive monitoring program to be implemented in three Columbia River sub-basins.  The primary objective of this project is the development of a rule set to guide the implementation of large-scale monitoring and evaluation programs across the Columbia River basin.  The project will accomplish this goal through the quantitative assessment of status and effectiveness monitoring and evaluation approaches.  The component of the overall project described herein specifically addresses the issue of developing standardized approaches to monitoring food resources for stream rearing salmonid fishes as an indicator of growth and survival rates.


Currently, stream macroinvertebrates are collected using kick nets and therefore samples include a large portion of debris.  Separating this debris from the invertebrates accounts for approximately ¾ of the cost to process these samples.  Drift net samples, on the other hand, capture very little detritus and cost approximately 1/10th the price of benthic samples to separate.  The total cost to process a drift sample, information that may prove to be more relevant to fish production, could be as low as $20/sample versus the approximately $200/sample cost to process a benthic sample.
	Another disadvantage of kick net samples is that they do not sample the surface for terrestrial insects that have fallen into the stream.  Terrestrial invertebrates can account for a substantial proportion of the diet of drift feeding fishes. 
	The goal of the proposed work requested in this requisition is to provide samples and to test a sampling methodology used to estimate benthic and drift invertebrate abundance.  In addition, field observations of spatially explicit juvenile red band trout (RBT) growth rates and temperature will also be collected.  The combination of this data can then be used to determine the metrics of invertebrate abundance coupled with temperature that best describes growth rates of RBT. Eco Logical has particular specialized experience with the on-going development of Research, Monitoring and Evaluation (RME) programs for FCRPS Biological Opinion Action Agencies in the John Day River basin as the coordinator for the John Day RME pilot project (a NMFS/NWFSC project funded by Bonneville Power Administration).  Eco Logical Research also was the contractor for the initial phase of the work contained in this procurement request – they performed the initial year of field data sampling and they have the samples and associated data collected in 2005.  Therefore, Eco Logical Research is uniquely positioned to do this work as they have the specialized training and experience, as well as having direct connections to the overall project in which this piece of work is situated, have been directly responsible for this work up until now, and are in the unique position of currently holding the samples and data.
This notice may represent the only offical notice. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation number FA4600-06-T-0011 is issued as a request for quotation.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 423690. The business size standard is 500 employees.  Offutt AFB intends to issue a purchase order for the following services: 
STATEMENT OF WORK:
Scope:		The work covered by this statement of work includes the furnishing of labor, material, and equipment in performing all operations in connection with the removal and replacement of the sound system located in the Dougherty Conference Center, Room 140. 
General:	The work under this contract will be performed on Offutt AFB Nebraska and can proceed on 27 February 2006 and be completed no later than 8 March 2006.  Contractor will comply with the following provisions and is subject to the terms and conditions of the contract.  

1.	The project end date must be March 8th 2006.
2.	The contractor will remove and dispose of all replaced equipment, wires and garbage and dispose of them properly.
3.	The contractor will provide a system to connect all microphones and speakers together.  This system will allow the controller to control any aspect of the microphones and speakers in the room.  
4.	The contractor will provide 1 rack-mounted computer (PC, stand alone) that will have the necessary software and user interface (UI) to control of each microphones and speakers in the room.  The UI will have the ability to turn off or mute, increase gain and decrease gain of each 58 microphones (57 on the desks, 1 on the podium).  This UI will also allow the volume control of each speaker zone in the room.  The PC will come with a wireless card that is 802.11A, B and G capable to cover all wireless bands in the room.
5.	The contractor will provide a control panel that has a privacy button that is attached to the indicator lights in the room indicating that a predetermined action is being initiated.  The control panel will also provide up and down buttons for the external screen in the room.  This is a hardware item not a software item.   
6.	The contractor will replace the 36 speakers in the ceiling.  
7.	The contractor will replace all of the current speaker cable with 18 gauge plenum speaker wire. 
8.	The contractor will create listening zones in the room so that when an individual is speaking the speakers in their zone are muted thus allowing the controller to increase the gain on the speaker’s microphone.     
9.	The contractor will remove, replace and strategically move all the surround sound speakers in the room that are on the walls.  These speakers need to be controlled by the UI also.
10.	The contractor will remove and replace the current microphones with microphones that don’t have goose-necks and have only one pivot point at the base of the microphone to allow the user to move the microphone in one direction only allowing the user to make more room on the desk.  The microphones need to have a light to indicate which user is speaking.  This light is placed at the top of the microphone around the actual speaking part of the microphone. 
11.	The contractor will provide push-to-talk buttons on all microphones minus the podium.  The buttons will have a light inside indicating that the microphone is active.  Then the button is pushed the light is on.  The buttons need to have the capability to stat on once pushed and then when pushed again the light goes out and the microphone is muted.  These need to be out of the way but still in easy reach. 
12.	The contractor will provide small, non-obtrusive labels stating “Push to talk”.  Preferably brass with black letters 2” wide by 1/2” tall with good double-sided tape on the back.   They will be placed near the button and near the microphone. 
13.	The contractor will replace the current microphones and cover the two (2) holes that are in the top of the desks by each microphone.  The new microphones will use the plate that will be covering the holes.  The plate needs to be able to cover both holes.  Preferable square plates with rounded corners.  The wires from the microphones should be unexposed and under the desks.   
14.	The contractor will provide 8-10 high quality, small, ceiling hanging microphones.  To pick up the speaker’s voice at the podium or if they choose to walk around in between the horse-shoe table.  The microphones will need to pick up the speakers voice anywhere in that area.     
15.	The contractor will provide a switch of sorts to connect the sound system of the VCR and the computer/microphones.  Currently the sound from the VCR goes through separate speakers and we need the VCR to go through the same system as the microphones.  
16.	EXPRESS WARRANTY
a)	First year: 100% replacement warranty to include all labor cost.
b)	Second and Third Year:  100% replacement warranty.  If failure rate during the year exceeds 10%, contractor will supply all labor to install and test replacement equipment.  
c)	Warranty will commence after government acceptance of all items supplied by order.  Government will denote acceptance by completion of DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report.
d)	Fourth Year and beyond:  Standard manufacturer pro-rated warranty.  Contractor shall provide copy of pertinent warranty information upon completion of installation.

Disposal of Material: 	All other material resulting from work accomplished under this statement of work will be disposed of by the contractor outside the confines of Offutt AFB NE.

<DESC>The subject Combined Synopsis/Solicitation that appeared on 2/09/06 is modified to answer the following questions and to extend the Response Date to 02/22/06. 1Q.  Do you have a system that satisfies specs or one you know that exactly fits specs? 1A. No. The specification is written to include a typical, off the shelf 10,000 lb-f capacity universal tensile testing machine. 2Q. Is switching between Eng and SI units during a test necessary?  2A.  It is not necessary to switch between units during a test, but it's necessary to change units before the test.  3Q.   Explain "display panels must be printable".  3A.  After the test, hardcopy of plot will be printed.  Plot need not be a "screen capture".  The plot could be developed during post processing, but the data that was displayed on the screen needs to be replicated in hard copy form.  4Q.  Where is copy of ASTM F1157-2004 available?  Are these a simple quick release grips?  4A.  ASTM F1157-2004 is available through www.astm.org.  In general, ASTM F1157-2004 does not specify the fixture to machine interface.  Rather, F1157 specifies the interface features between the seal and fixture.  For example, F1157 specifies a round bar with 1/4" diameter be used to test a wire seal.  The fixture standardizes the diameter so the wire seal is forced over a defined radius during a test.  Note, the 1/4" diameter cited is only an example.  F1157 does not specify "quick release grips", that are typically used in coupon testing.

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government. An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. On the heels of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, signs of a possible pandemic have emerged in Southeast Asia, as lethal infections of poultry and humans with avian influenza virus H5N1 continue and this virus is now endemic in bird populations, which increase the likelihood of continued human exposure.

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Although domestic vaccine supply and usage has gradually risen over the past decade and incremental expansion of domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity is anticipated over the next decade, private sector investment in surge capacity to meet the vaccine requirement in a pandemic is unlikely. 
       
One means to increase vaccine capacity is to increase the yield of vaccine product incrementally at various stages in the vaccine manufacturing process. Further modifications of present influenza vaccine manufacturing processes may be productive in increasing product stability. Taken together these improvements could have positive impacts on surge capacity during times of vaccine shortage and in the event of an influenza pandemic. 
       
The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple contract awards to improve the manufacturing process of influenza vaccines to achieve greater product yields and potentially shorter production cycles. Contracts will be awarded to influenza vaccine manufacturers or their corporate partners, which have vaccine manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. and which plan and implement a coordinated and integrated systematic strategy to enhance influenza vaccine manufacturing. The vaccine manufacturing activities that may be pursued include raw material selection and qualification, upstream processing, downstream processing, vaccine formulation, and final product presentation. Other activities supported by this RFP include manufacturing, clinical evaluation, and validation of pilot investigational and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccines manufactured by the improved processes. 

Eligibility requirements of vaccine manufacturers for these contracts include the following: (1) Licensure and manufacturing of vaccines for human usage; (2) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing, clinical development, and FDA-licensure of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage in the U.S. market; and (3) Documented development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 
       
The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to expand the domestic influenza vaccine capacity for seasonal and pandemic influenza. The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three years or 36 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-07 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

Release of the solicitation has been delayed and is currently projected for September 2005.ward date of September 2005.

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Currently, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines are comprised of 15 ug of hemagglutinin (HA) for each included virus strain and are administered intramuscularly. Studies recently have shown that antigen sparing effects have been elicited for monovalent influenza vaccines formulated with adjuvants and trivalent influenza vaccines administered intradermally. Antigen sparing approaches may increase overall influenza vaccine capacity in the short term by reducing the amount of HA antigen that may be needed in the vaccine by using adjuvants or by administering vaccines by alternate routes such as intradermally.   

The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to develop medical devices and/or domestically- manufactured antigen sparing influenza vaccines for FDA licensure and human usage. The scope of activities for which the Offeror may request funds may include manufacturing and clinical evaluation of pilot and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccine using adjuvants or other immune enhancing substances. Funds may be used also for vaccine and medical device development and testing. 

Contracts will be awarded to companies or their corporate partners that have U.S. manufacturing facilities available for influenza vaccines, adjuvants, and/or medical devices, which may afford an antigen sparing effect. Other eligibility requirements of manufacturers and their corporate partners, if applicable, for these contracts include the following: (1) Documented history of development and clinical testing of vaccines, adjuvants, or medical devices for human usage; (2) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing and clinical development leading toward FDA-licensure of pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage; and (3) Documented comprehensive development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 

The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to facilitate late stage development and testing leading toward FDA-licensure of new antigen sparing influenza vaccines in U.S.-based manufacturing facilities. The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three years or 36 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement to provide support for NATA and Risk Assessment Activities within the Integrated Air Program.  The EPA has integrated its air toxics program into four components.  The first component is source specific regulatory programs.  This component includes the development of MACT standards under section 112(d), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards under 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources.  The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives on multi-media and cumulative risks, such as the Great Water Program and EPA?s Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxics initiative. The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales, ranging from national-scale to local-scale assessments.  The fourth and final component of EPA?s air toxics program is education and outreach.   One of the purposes of this contract is to provide support for risk assessment activities associated with the first component of EPA's air toxics program.  Within the context of this component, EPA evaluates the effects of hazardous and potentially hazardous air pollutants and develops appropriate regulatory strategies. In this role, EPA:  (1) identifies, screens, and characterizes air pollutants to determine which should be evaluated further as candidates for being listed as hazardous;  (2) reviews and evaluates health and/or ecological assessment documents on hazardous air pollutants; (3) performs risk assessments using EPA methods and models, or other methods and/or models if more appropriate to help guide reasoned decision-making; (4) identifies and evaluates alternative control options; (5) gathers information on production, use, emissions, control technology, control cost, and regulatory status to establish appropriate regulatory development priorities; (6) assesses the effectiveness of EPA and State/local programs in controlling hazardous and criteria pollutants; and (7) coordinates with other EPA offices and Federal and State/local programs to develop appropriate single or multimedia (e.g.,  air, water, solid waste, and/or other media) regulations. 	Another purpose of this contract is to provide support for the second, third, and fourth components of EPA's air toxics program.  This will be accomplished by developing assessment tools, conducting assessments, communicating the results of assessments, and educating the public.  In addition, as EPA moves forward with its air program, the EPA will be examining the air pollution problem in a more integrated fashion (i.e., considering the cumulative effects of air toxics and criteria pollutants across media rather than conducting separate assessments).  This contract will also provide support for these integrated assessments.  EPA anticipates the award of two cost-plus fixed fee level of effort type contract with a base period of performance of twelve (12) months, with four (4) additional twelve-month option periods.   The total duration of the proposed contracts is sixty (60) months.  The first contract, will be awarded on the basis of full and open competition which will consist of 5,100 base quantity labor hours and 15,300 optional quantity labor hours for each of the five (5) periods, for a total contract maximum of 102,000 labor hours.  The second contract, will be awarded as a 100% small business set-aside which will consist of 5,100 base quantity labor hours and 15,300 optional quantity labor hours for each of the five (5) periods, for a total contract maximum of 102,000 labor hours.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541620  with a size standard of 6.5 million.  This requirement is a follow on to contract numbers 68-D-01-071 and 68-D-01-076 with ECR and 68-D-01-052 with ICF each of which expire on September 30, 2006.  The RFP will be issued approximately on March 6, 2006 and proposals will be due approximately thirty (30) calendar days after the RFP issuance date.

<DESC>This acquisition is for a firm fixed price, requirements contract consisting of a six-month base period, plus four pre-priced one-year options.  The base period will run from 01 April 2006 to 30 September 2006.  Option Year One is from 1 October 2007 through 30 September 2007.  Option Year Two is from 1 October 2008 through 30 September 2008.  Option Year Three is from 1 October 2009 through 30 September 2009.  Option Year Four is from 1 October 2010 through 30 September 2010.  The applicable NAICS code is 611430 with a corresponding small business size standard (not to exceed) $6,500,000.  Acquisition will be set-aside for small business concerns.  

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED:  Contractor shall furnish all labor, material, equipment, supervision, transportation and management necessary to perform Maintenance Resource Management Training in accordance with the performance work statement.  Services under this contract are required to be performed at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.

Evaluation for award will be Performance-Price Trade-off (PPTO).  Issuance of the solicitation will be on or about 15 February 2006 and will close on or about 16 March 2006.  The solicitation will be available over the Internet only; NO HARD COPIES will be sent.  Follow the links on the EPS website to access the solicitation:  USAF Offices, Air Mobility Command Locations, and 436 CONS, Dover AFB, DE.     Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.  IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:  Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires that any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contracts shall be submitted in electronic form.  Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided via the website.  Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.  As of January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and 
certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or to list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN.  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is designed to help you gather information you need for the resultant clauses/provisions.  The information you provide in your questionnaire is automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  The questionnaire is not your official ORCA submission; the information reflected in your provisions is the version Contracting will review.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; you then acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.  The POC for this acquisition is Lani L. Lowe (302) 677-5028, Fax (302) 677-2309, email: lani.lowe@dover.af.mil.

<DESC>SAIC-Frederick, the Operations and Maintenance Contractor for the NCI Frederick Cancer Research Facility will be soliciting for the services described herein on behalf of the NCI and the NHGRI.  The NCI and NHGRI have agreed to pursue a three year pilot  - The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).  A sine qua non for the pilot project is high quality human biospecimens.  The term “high quality” refers not only the histological and molecular properties of the tissue, but also to characteristics such as degree and quality of clinical annotation, appropriately informed consent and IRB protocol, as well as unencumbered contractual status (MTA or IP restrictions).  To ensure the rapid availability, highest quality, and uniformity of the biological specimens for the project, the NCI proposes to establish a centralized Biospecimen Resource Center (BRC) that would acquire material from existing cancer tissue repositories that have been pre-identified as part of an earlier NCI request for information (RFI) seen at the URL (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-CA-06-002.html).  In addition, the centralized facility will have a role in evaluating for suitability to the TCGA other existing repositories for potential acquisition of their biospecimens.  The centralized facility will provide ongoing services for importing the materials from such repositories, processing those materials into molecular derivatives, and distributing those derivatives to the various analytical sites.  The BRC will also develop, implement and publish standard operating procedures (SOPs) for all processes of cancer tissue sample acquisition, preparation, storage, and distribution, including operating and QA/QC procedures that can be validated.  Biospecimen types will include tumor tissue, and normal cell sources such as blood and/or buccal cells.  The BRC will also establish SOPs for prospective collections of other tumor types, and develop new protocols for extracting molecular isolates from tissues in synchrony with new analytical procedures being developed within the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) framework.  The RFP is intended to solicit responses from parties interested in providing centralized biorepository and biospecimen services to the joint NCI and NHGRI - The Cancer Genome Atlas.  Only one contract will be issued.

If the above listed URL is not available, please notify jlewis@ncifcrf.gov for the text version of the URL.

Interested potential sources are to submit a letter of interest with their point of contact information to Jeanne Lewis, email: jlewis@ncifcrf.gov.  We are expecting release of the RFP in the next few weeks.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled JPL DESKTOP COMPUTING SUPPORT, Solicitation #SS-05-16, which was posted on October 21, 2005. You are notified that additions were made to the Statement of Work and asset value. The due date for responses is extended to February 28, 2006. NOTE: If you responded to the original announcement and your company is still interested in this RFP, given the changes in scope, you are required to respond again. Those companies responding a second time are not required to submit company information unless that information has changed since your previous submittal. DESCRIPTION - The California Institute of Technology’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), operating under a prime contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), seeks to perform market research to identify potential sources interested in responding to a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the integrated, managed solution to JPL Desktop Computing. This announcement is a restatement of a previous announcement posted under Solicitation No. SS-05-16. It contains some significant Statement of Work changes and a significant change to the asset value.  Potential sources shall provide all necessary resources including, but not limited to, personnel, proximal and remote facilities, transportation, computer hardware, software, documentation, and all necessary equipment and support services. The services to be performed are, but not limited to:  HELP DESK - Provide help desk problem resolution for computer hardware, software and networking in support of the JPL end-users and JPL technical service providers. Help desk operational coverage shall be provided 24 hours per day 7 days per week (24 x 7) all year.  SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATION - Provide Systems Administration (SA) coverage 10 x 5, that is, 10 hours per day on JPL workdays.  Systems administration includes interfacing with users, both on-site and remotely, and implementation of: IT Security, network interface and connectivity; PC and Macintosh installation and configuration; client-server administration; planning, analysis, system engineering, and documentation; and asset protection and disaster recovery. The software infrastructure required to be administered will include commercial operating systems, utilities, tools, and applications plus public domain software.  The scope is limited to those functions and applications being implemented on PC and Macintosh systems and those Unix systems which are tightly integrated with the PC/Macintosh systems on the same subnetwork. The systems include desktops, notebooks, and servers, and the related hardware, software, and network interfaces.  COMPUTER HARDWARE MAINTENANCE - Provide coverage 10 x 5, that is, 10 hours per day on JPL workdays. Provide hardware maintenance for desktop, notebook, and server PC and Macintosh systems and related peripherals. Maintenance service includes preventative and corrective maintenance, sparing, component upgrades, installation of new equipment, and relocations. REPLENISHMENT OF HARDWARE (RPLN) - Provide system replenishment (scheduled replacement) and software replenishment services including the end-to-end process of requirements definition, technology assessment, product selection, placement of orders, procurement, delivery, installation, and setup, thereby providing to JPL the beneficial use of such systems and software. The systems replenished are being provided to JPL, as a service and ownership responsibility is the potential contractor’s. The replenishment cycle may vary with system type and project requirements. Installation of software is expected to be more frequent in order to maintain and improve interoperability and meet security requirements. Implement software installation using techniques, such as push-pull, which ensure user choice of timing of upgrade.  Recommend, maintain, control, update, and offer to users standard baseline configurations, including hardware, software, and peripherals, which are compatible and interoperate in the JPL computing environment. Recommend, maintain, control, update, and offer to users selected standard upgrade options, including hardware, software, and peripherals, which build upon the baseline configurations without compromising compatibility and interoperability in the JPL computing environment.  Perform product testing and evaluations as required to ensure compatibility and interoperability. Coordinate recommendations with JPL. Communicate with the customer and take responsibility and ownership of the customer’s RPLN process. Review with the customer the system configuration and the delivery schedule and process. Coordinate requirements for setup support, including data transfer, initial support and training, and support from other service areas. PURCHASE HARDWARE - Purchase hardware, as specified by JPL that will remain government-owned equipment. Potential contractor shall deliver the hardware and install, as needed.  ADDITIONAL SERVICES – JPL is considering the expansion of the current Statement of Work to include additional enterprise IT services. These services are: Helpdesk Consolidation (including Oracle level one support, Network Operations, Information Services Operations), Server Consolidation (including Web hosting, Application hosting, and File Sharing), Software License Management, Email, Calendaring, Instant Messaging, Backup and Recovery, Network Operations (including wireless), Mobile Devices (Treo, Blackberry, PDA, and cell phones), IT Training, and VoIP.  It is anticipated that these additional services will appear in the final RFP as priced options. GENERAL INFORMATION - JPL is a sprawling campus over several acres with computers located in every building. The majority of support will occur at the main campus in Pasadena. However, some support of offices in different locales within the U.S. shall be required. No physical space will be provided by JPL. The potential contractor will have to arrange for their own physical space to support this effort. There are about 8,000 systems with a mix of 75 percent PC and 25 percent Mac. Additional Information about JPL can be found at  http://jpl.nasa.gov  The potential contact is envisioned to run for a five (5) year period with option(s) to extend another five (5) years. Therefore, technology solutions will be assessed for viability over the next ten (10) year period. The potential contractor will be measured against metrics in the first five (5) years and to earn the option(s) to extend the potential contract over a ten (10) year period.  It is anticipated that the potential contractor will have to finance approximately $16M in hardware costs and arrange software licenses of over $1.5M up front, spreading the costs over the first five (5) years. Hardware and software will be left in place for the transition of services. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE – JPL, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, California 91109-8099.  SMALL BUSINESS GOALS - Small Business Goals will likely exceed thirty (30) percent and the potential contractor will have to team with small businesses (unless the contractor is a small business concern) as part of the evaluation of the proposal. REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL - Release of the RFP is anticipated in the third quarter of calendar year 2006. RESPONSES DUE - JPL requests that interested parties respond with their company’s capabilities via brochures, company literature or any medium, which will describe their company’s capabilities. Potential sources should respond to this requirement via email to: Steven.L.Simpson@jpl.nasa.gov, no later than February 28, 2006. All correspondence shall be conducted via email. Company literature should be mailed to JPL, Attn: Steve Simpson, M/S 190-220, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109-8099. Include your company name and contact information; small business status; and any other information about your company and/or experience in this type of effort. If you responded to the original announcement and your company is still interested in this RFP (given the changes in scope), you are required to respond again. Those responding a second time are not required to submit company information unless that information has changed since your previous submittal. Companies with a genuine interest in proposing to JPL for the Desktop Services Contract will be invited to participate in a two (2) hour “one-on-one” session with JPL either April 17 or April 19. JPL employees who will influence the RFP are interested in interacting with companies to discuss innovative ideas that may improve the services provided to the Laboratory and its employees. POINT OF CONTACT - Steve Simpson, Subcontracts Manager, Phone 818-354-7243, FAX 818-354-3494, Email: Steven.L.Simpson@jpl.nasa.gov

<DESC>Request for Information Electronic Health Care Eligibility and Benefit Inquiry Services Introduction:  Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the United States largest healthcare provider networks, with medical centers, clinics and pharmacies throughout the country.  While some of the care provided is service related, much of the care is not service related and may be reimbursable by a patient’s health insurance plan.  VHA needs to have current, accurate healthcare coverage and benefits information.  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit information from interested parties to assist VHA in improving its healthcare insurance eligibility verification and identification processes. Disclaimers: 1.	This is not a procurement document.  At this time, VHA is requesting only information.  This may result in one or more formal procurements.  Pricing information and/or price quotes are not being requested. 2.	Only written responses to this RFI will be accepted.  No requests to schedule meetings with VHA resources or to present information in-person or electronically will be granted.  Responders may submit materials on electronic media, including product demonstrations.  We reserve the right to contact selected responders to request additional information, meetings and/or demonstrations. 3.	VHA, as part of the Department of Veterans Affairs, is a Federal agency, subject to various public records rules and regulations.  Responders must not submit any information that they deem confidential and/or proprietary. Background:  VHA, like most healthcare providers, attempts to collect accurate health insurance information from its patients prior to the provision of service.  We understand that this information is dynamic and coverage and benefits information needs to be verified by the health plan.  VHA is seeking opportunities to improve this process through the use of technology and standards. VHA also needs to improve the process for identification of health insurance.  Due to a number of factors, VHA may not be aware of a patient’s health insurance. The relationship between VHA and Medicare and Medicaid is unique.  Because these are other federally funded healthcare programs, VHA can not be reimbursed by them.  VHA currently submits “claims” through a single Medicare Intermediary and Carrier, Trailblazer Health Enterprise, for the purposes of obtaining accurate coordination of benefits data to be submitted to payers Secondary to Medicare.  VHA can not be reimbursed by Medicare HMO (Part C), Medicare Pharmacy (Part D) and Medicaid plans.  Therefore, there is no requirement for coverage/benefit identification and verification with these health plans. VHA has emphasized the use of information technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare administrative processing.  VHA has implemented the use of the HIPAA standard Health Care Eligibility Benefit Inquiry and Response (270/271) electronic transaction (see Technology Environment section for further information).  VHA has also used external vendors, primarily Public Consulting Group, to identify health insurance coverage for its patients.  VHA is specifically interested in solutions that will leverage its investments in the HIPAA standard transactions and data integration. Technology Environment:  VHA operates a distributed “practice management” software application – Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA).  There is currently no centralized information store of health insurance information.  Within each VistA system, patient health insurance information is maintained, including data about the payer/health plan, insurance plan, coverage dates and benefits.  This data is then used in the billing process to generate medical claims to the appropriate health plan. As stated earlier, VHA has implemented and is currently in production with the HIPAA Health Care Eligibility Benefit Inquiry and Response (270/271) electronic transaction.  Medical Centers through the system generate eligibility inquiries.  These inquiries are transferred to a central computing facility (the Financial Services Center (FSC) located with the Austin Automation Center (AAC)) from the VistA applications in a batch process daily.  This data is then translated into HIPAA compliant 270 “real-time” transactions and communicated to a single healthcare clearinghouse, Emdeon.  Emdeon distributes the 270 transactions to the appropriate Information Source, which may be a health plan or an internal data store.  Emdeon communicates “real-time” 271 Response transactions back to the VA.  The responses are distributed back the requesting VistA site as a batch data extract. Current Issues:  Like many healthcare provider organizations, VHA does not feel that they have had adequate return on investment for the implementation of the HIPAA standard eligibility inquiry and response.  The following are issues that of particular interest that VHA would like responders to address in their responses to this RFI: •	Limited Payer Access – VHA, as a national healthcare provider, interacts with the majority of health plans (except those noted previously).  The current implementation model provides VHA with access to only limited health plans.  VHA is particularly interested in being able to conduct 270/271 processing with all Blue Cross Blue Shield plans and payers Secondary to Medicare. •	Limited Payer Responses – Many payers that do provide an eligibility response provide only confirmation of coverage, which is the HIPAA minimal response.  While this is useful, VHA staff has to contact the payer by phone in order to obtain more detailed benefit information.  VHA is interested in solutions that improve the completeness of payer responses, including benefit information and other payment sources, such as “carve-out” payers for dental, mental health, pharmacy, vision and other benefits. •	Payer Identification – VHA recognizes that the HIPAA 270/271 transactions are intended for verification, not identification, of health insurance.  VHA is interested in options that will assist in the identification of payment sources for its patient population. •	Unreliable Payer Responses – VHA has experienced payer 271 responses that have been inaccurate.  This has been discovered when other information sources, such as a payer Internet site or phone calls to the payer.  Some of the incidences may be related to patient identification. Responding to this Request for Information: Respondents are encouraged to provide concise, targeted responses to this RFI.  Ideally, respondents will provide information about payers that can be accessed, proven solutions that can improve eligibility responses accuracy and completeness and/or options for health insurance identification.  Respondents are not required to address all of the issues above.  VHA is open to a “best of breed” approach to solutions. Respondents are cautioned from providing pricing and proprietary information.  While marketing materials will be accepted, there is no guarantee that all information will be reviewed.  No submitted materials can be returned. Questions and Inquiries:  Due to the nature of this RFI, there will not be responses to any questions or inquiries.  Responders are encouraged review the VA Web site (www.va.gov) for additional information.

<RESPDATE>030306
<CONTACT>Kim Knight, 609-485-4662
<DESC>The FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center Office of Aviation Research has a requirement for services in Video Landing Parameter Survey Reports.  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1, this Screening Information Request (SIR) Request for Information (RFI) is released for the purpose of obtaining information to allow the FAA to: determine the level of competition, make a programmatic affordability assessment, and develop its acquisition strategy. The Statement of Work requirements are as follows:   1.0	 Background: The Federal Aviation Administration William J. Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City NJ and the Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC), Aircraft Division, Patuxant River, MD have been collaborating in a technical exchange program in support of the FAA's Aging Aircraft Research.   As part of this partnership, the Airport and Aircraft Safety Research and Development Division AAR-400 is leveraging the Navy's sophisticated landing data acquisition and analysis technology, specifically developed for naval carrier aircraft, and utilizing it to evaluate commercial aircraft operations. The enhanced four-camera system was successfully tested and demonstrated at the Atlantic City International in February 1994. The system demonstration confirmed the ability of Naval Aircraft Landing Data Acquisition System (NAALDAS) to collect landing data in adverse weather conditions.  A dramatic series of landings under ILS conditions in a snowstorm, with 15-knot crosswinds, showed the versatility of the recording system.  Landings at airports with limited ILS capability or limited runway flexibility may lead to more cross wind landings and different applied landing loads. To date the following eight video landing parameter surveys have been conducted,  JFK International (JFK)			June 1994 Washington National Reagan (DCA) 	June 1995 Honolulu International (HNL)		April 1996 London City Airport (LCY) 		June 1997   Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) 	July 1999 London Heathrow (LHR)			July 2001 Atlantic City International (ACY)		2002/2003 Cincinnati (CVG)				Sept 2004 Formal reports have not yet been published for the last three surveys: London Heathrow (LHR), Atlantic City International (ACY) and Cincinnati (CVG).  In order to write high quality documentation (reports) describing the video landing survey results, continuing technical support is needed for the reduction and analysis of data from these surveys.  The ACY data was actually acquired using the FAA's Video Landing Parameter Facility, which was operational during parts of 2002 and 2003. 2.0  Description of Work:   The contractor shall prepare draft technical reports for the following three video landing parameter surveys: 					     Approximate Number of Landings Airfield		Widebody  Narrowbody	Regional Jets	Commuters Heathrow (LHR)		      600    550            	 Atlantic City Int'l           200    250(ACY)                                                                 	50	 Cincinnati (CVG)	       50    150            500                  	       3.0  Output:   The output from the commercial airport landing parameter surveys is large amounts of landing parameter data describing typical transport landing impact conditions.  These data are/have been used to:  -	Assess the appropriateness of FAR 25.473, "Ground Load Conditions and            Assumptions,"  -	Validate/update NASA TN D 4529, which was derived from usage data, measured            during the 1950s,   -	Provide the airframe manufacturers with a detailed characterization of typical large           Transport airplane landing velocities and angular displacements, and  -     Provide data for hard landing accident investigation. -	Update and verify 25.473, Ground Load Conditions and Assumptions for Heavy Wide Body Transports 4.0  TECHNICAL TASKS: 4.1	The contractor shall complete the reduction and analysis of all landings from the FAA's London Heathrow (LHR) Video Landing Parameter Survey and prepare a draft report to be submitted to the FAA for publication 4.2	The contractor shall complete the reduction and analysis of all landings collected at the FAA Video Landing Facility at Atlantic City International Airport (ACY) and prepare a draft report to be submitted to the FAA for publication 4.3	The contractor shall complete the reduction and analysis of all landings from the FAA's Cincinnati (CVG) Video Landing Parameter Survey and prepare a draft report to be submitted to the FAA for publication. 5.0  DELIVERABLES 5.1	Data report for Heathrow (LHR)	Survey - 8 months from Date of Award 5.2	Data report for the data collected at the FAA Video Landing Parameter Facility at Atlantic City Int'l (ACY) - 16 months from Date of Award	 5.3	Data Report for Cincinnati (CVG) Survey - 24 months Date of Award 6.0	REFERENCES Pertinent prior FAA Technical report titles, which contain the nature of the of product being acquired and their corresponding web addresses are as follows: 6.1	DOT/FAA/AR-96/125, Video Landing Parameter Survey - John F Kennedy International Airport, July 1997     www.tc.faa.gov/its/worldpac/techrpt/ar96-125.pdf 6.2	DOT/FAA/AR-97/106, Video Landing Parameter Survey - Washington National Airport, June 1999                   www.tc.faa.gov/its/worldpac/techrpt/ar97-106.pdf 6.3	DOT/FAA/AR-00/72, Video Landing Parameter Survey- Honolulu International Airport, April 2001    www.tc.faa.gov/its/worldpac/techrpt/ar00-72.pdf 6.4	DOT/FAA/AR-04/47, Cumulative Aircraft Video Landing Parameter Surveys Summary Report - London City Airport, Philadelphia International Airport and Atlantic City International Airport, December 2004                 www.tc.faa.gov/its/worldpac/techrpt/ar04-47.pdf 7.0	 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Twenty-four months from Date of Award 8.0  GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT The FAA will provide as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) all of the reduced data listed in Section 2.0 above in electronic form with the understanding that the data recorded from ACY and CVG have not been completely quality edited.

AFSVA will not provide reimbursement for any expenses incurred in connection with this RFI including costs of preparing a response, providing any additional information, or preparing/presenting a software demonstration.
 
3.	Scope and Description.  This must be a web-based system that supports federal and state(s) laws and be capable of running under common commercial operating systems in stand-alone or network environments.  The supported Services activities must share common data elements (customer information, facility and equipment schedules, etc.) across the entire system. Customer self-serve functions (reservations, update of household data, payments, etc.) via touch-tone telephones and web-based routines must be available.  The system must be able to import, export, and report data for use by other government and non-government data systems (e.g. accounting) through user-initiated routines or “live” interfaces.  Data entry/capture methods include standard and programmable keyboards, touch screen, barcode and magnetic-stripe reader.  The system must support common peripherals to include electronic cash drawers, pole displays, hand-held inventory taking units, credit card transactions and multiple print devices. 

3.1 There are approximately 98 Air Force bases with appropriated fund (APF) and non-appropriated fund (NAF) activities. The Headquarters, Air Force Services Agency (HQ AFSVA), is seeking information for a SAMS system to meet the needs of a range of community and recreation programs.  The types of programs include youth activities, child development centers, family day care, full-day and before and after school programs, community centers, fitness and sports centers, bowling centers, outdoor recreation programs, equipment rental, golf courses, marketing, aero clubs, information-tickets-travel, arts and crafts centers, auto hobby shops, swimming pools, recreational vehicle (RV) storage, campgrounds,  veterinarian and deployed operations.  These programs require a system to handle functions which include, but are not limited to, activity registration, instructor and volunteer management, campsite reservations and check in/out, locker and storage management, equipment checkout, equipment and parts inventory management, facility and court reservations, equipment and facility maintenance management, retail sales management including food and beverage operations, customer records including medical and immunization data, facility and program membership and access control, league and tournament management, ticket sales and trip/tour bookings, tee time reservations, average/handicap calculations, and related program management functions.  The software should also support deployed activity operations.  Many of the above functions are performed manually because the activities lack connectivity to the Internet.  

3.1.1.   Prospective vendors should include all information regarding implementation, field guidance, training and sustainment services needed to support all Air Force Services entities worldwide. 


3.1.2.   AFSVA reserves the right to request software demonstrations from any prospective vendor. If desired, demonstrations will be scheduled on a non-interference basis during the remainder of the current calendar year.

3.1.3.   Prospective vendors:
3.1.3.1.  Should include any hardware/software that augments or enhances their products’ performance or utility as separate items in their RFI 
3.1.3.2.  Should understand that replies consisting of software yet to be developed (e.g., “Vaporware”) will not be accepted, and
3.1.3.3.  Should understand that replies consisting of DOS or Macintosh based software products will not be accepted.
 

4.    Common Activity Requirements.  All prospective software must meet each of the following requirements (if applicable):
4.1.	Capable of managed and/or automated software updates.
4.2.	The system will be Web-based able to be accessed over a wide area network.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is seeking sources that are capable of providing management, technical and administrative support services to inventory, track, review, and maintain updates of periodic correction/revision submissions for Oil Pollution Act 1990/International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 (OPA 90/MARPOL 73/78) pollution response plans.    USCG requires support to transition from current hardcopy archive, review and approval process to an electronic workflow management system integrated with Homeport, a Government-Owned Contractor-Operated (GOCO), secure, enterprise Internet portal used to provide critical information and service delivery to the public, maritime industry, and the USCG.  ( http://homeport.uscg.mil )  A prospective source company should maintain an internal quality system based on ANSI/ASQC Q9001 or an equivalent quality standard.

Currently, the USCG Office of Vessel Activities (G-PCV-1) maintains approximately 816 active tank Vessel Response Plans (VRPs) covering approximately 7,200 tank vessels.   Foreign and domestic oil tank vessel owners and operators submit these plans in order to comply with the requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended by the OPA 90.  G-PCV-1 maintains approximately 1,717 Nontank Vessel Response Plans (NTVRPs) covering approximately 9,440 self-propelled Nontank Vessels of 400 Gross Tons and greater, that carry oil as fuel for main propulsion.  By 2008, G-PCV expects plans to be submitted for up to 24,000 nontank vessels.  

G-PCV-1 also maintains the following plans required under MARPOL 73/78: Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans (SOPEPs), Shipboard Marine Pollution Emergency Plans (SMPEP), and Shipboard Marine Pollution Emergency Plans for Noxious Liquid Substances (SMPEP-NLS).

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health intends to procure on a sole source basis to Elsevier MDL Science, Inc., 14600 Catalina St., San Leandro, California 94577 access to Elseviers MDL’s CrossFire Beilstein System consisting of the Beilstein Database and the CrossFire Software and the DiscoveryGate on-line database system.  Both of these databases are unique and Elsevier is the sole owner and possesses proprietary right of both systems.  Elsevier’s MDL Crossfire version of Beilstein provides searchable access to information related to organic chemistry.  Specifically, it provides the capability of searching the structures of over 7.5 million organic substances, including their reactions and their chemical, physical, and biological properties. Alternatively, Elsevier/MDL’s DiscoveryGate, which includes Beilstein, but extends the range of organic chemistry information well beyond Beilstein to 17 of it’s proprietary chemical, molecular and reaction databases. These information sources are integrated and searchable under a single DiscoveryGate interface. This will be a follow-on contract to contract number N02-OR-0-4054.  The period of performance shall be for one twelve (12) month period, with options to renew for four (4) successive twelve (12) month periods.  It is believed that Elsevier MDL is the sole source for this requirement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements) because of the proprietary nature of the Elsevier MDL’s CrossFire Beilstein and DiscoveryGate databases.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within twelve (12) days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This is not an RFP, but a survey to locate potential service disabled veteran owned small business capable of performing the proposed work.  It is anticipated that the Contractor will be required to provide a quality assurance program to evaluate and document the performance of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP).  Primary support of this contract shall be to provide in-field systems and performance survey services (herein after referred to as surveys) to assess and aid the performance and maintenance of the nationwide, long-term wet deposition monitoring networks of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP).  NADP collection stations are currently comprised in three sub-networks which include: precipitation chemistry and wet deposition sites in the National Trends Network (NTN); precipitation chemistry and wet deposition sites in the Atmospheric Integrated Research Monitoring Network (AIRMoN); and measurements of mercury concentrations in precipitation at wet deposition sites in the Mercury Deposition Network (MDN).  There are currently over 250 wet deposition sites in the NADP/NTN, over 90 sites in the NADP/MDN, including over 40 that are collocated at NTN sites, and 8 sites in NADP/AIRMoN, including three that are collocated at NTN sites. NADP operates sites throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands.  EPA provides support to the National Acid Deposition Program (NADP), a cooperative, multi-agency network, which measures precipitation chemistry and estimates atmospheric deposition for various pollutant ions and mercury. The surveys are undertaken to provide quality assurance pertaining to siting, sample collection and handling, equipment operation and maintenance, record keeping, reports and field laboratory procedures.  Site performance survey reports for the networks must be compatible with, and capable of, being electronically transferred to the data base maintained by NADP.   The surveys are essential to providing the quality assurance for NADP?s data analysis and require a high level of skill in audits of air quality monitoring systems and quality assurance, quality control, and data management.  The contractor will be responsible for selecting sites for survey and initial communications, making pre-trip travel and other preparations, conducting site surveys, providing technical assistance to site operators, and conducting maintenance. The purpose of this announcement is to determine the availability and capability of service disabled veteran owned small business firms to perform the above-described activities.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541620.  Interested service disable veteran owned small businesses must demonstrate in their qualification statements that they are qualified to perform work under this NAICS code.  The contract type will be firm fixed price with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.  This is a request for interested service disable veteran owned small business firms to submit a qualification statement of no longer than 10 pages to determine whether or not this procurement will be set aside for service disable veteran owned small businesses.  This is not a request for a technical or cost proposal. This request is for information and planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.  Based upon responses received, the Government reserves the right to set aside any and all procurements that may result hereunder for service disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  Interested businesses must demonstrate and will be evaluated on specific prior project experience and skill in the following areas:  field audits of air quality monitoring and quality assurance, field instrumentation, and data collection and laboratory procedure capabilities.  Subcontracting/teaming arrangements are not acceptable.

3.	Attach to aircrew helmets or be worn on personnel’s head with attachment system 

4.	Be retrofitted into all existing binocular systems currently being used by DoD, including but not limited to: AN/AVS-6 and 9, AN/PVS-5A, B, and C, M908, M909, M915A, AN/PVS-15, F5050, AN/AVS-502 low profile goggles, Wide Field of View, and possible Panoramic Goggle configurations 

5.	Preferred type of battery would be AA alkaline batteries (rotary) or ½-AA lithium batteries and must be commercially available

6.	Need to accommodate eyeglasses  

7.	Easy to use in a field location or survival situation and require no electricity

8.	Extreme Durability for field conditions

The AWB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives: 

1. The manufacturers suggested retail price and/or a schedule of lease pricing for commercial product. To include separate purchase of filter systems versus complete goggles
2. Cost of Technical support or Training needed to use equipment
3. Possible use of demo equipment, (preferred 3 sets of night vision goggles), at no cost to Air Force
	4. The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
	5. The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the above desirable and 
beneficial attributes of the USAF.

<DESC>Reference Sources Sought Synopsis for IT Application/Server Support, 19 Oct 2005.

We appreciate the interest expressed in the WR-ALC/IT effort to consolidate desktop support and application/server support contracts for WR-ALC.  Market research indicates a large number of capable companies, such that a great number of resources (both Government and Contractor) would be required to accomplish both competitive efforts in parallel.  Accordingly, the decision has been made to first focus on the desktop support effort.  We intend to pursue a partnership agreement with IT through an 8(a) set-aside competition.  Contractors meeting 8(a) criteria will be allowed to form teams including non-8(a) contractors.  An Industry Day is being planned for March 2006, with dates and details to be announced soon on the FedBizOpps website.  The Industry Day will provide an opportunity for clarification of the requirement, as well as industry input.  WR-ALC/IT plans to proceed with the application/server support effort following award of the desktop support effort.  We anticipate extending current software application/server support contracts by approximately 12 to 15 months to provide interim coverage.  For the application support consolidation effort, market research indicates a large number of capable companies.  Based on responses to the market research, we anticipate that this effort will also be conducted as an 8(a) set-aside competition.  Because of resource constraints, this effort will be delayed approximately 12 months.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis for Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned, Hub-Zone and Service disabled Veterans-Owned Small Business concerns only.  This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.  GSA/FAS have a requirement to replace existing Federal Relay Service contract, Video Relay Service (VRS).  GSA/FAS is seeking Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned, Hubzone and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns that can provide the following Video Relay Services. VRS is a form of Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS) that enables persons who have hearing disabilities and use American Sign Language (ASL) to communicate with voice telephone users through video equipment, rather than through typed text.  Video equipment links the VRS user with a TRS operator-called a “Video Interpreter” (VI), so that the VRS user and the VI can see and communicate with each other in signed conversation.  

The Government seeks companies that can provide end-to-end, proven commercially available, high speed IP Video Relay Services (VRS) and innovative TRS solutions to Federal Government agencies nationwide. Contractor shall provide and operate VRS services twenty four hours a day, seven days a week (24/7), and 365 days a year.

<CONTACT>Joseph Cloft, 256-955-3407
<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC), in support of the Department of Defense (DoD) Counter Narco-Terrorism Program Office (CNTPO), desires to contract for the necessary goods and services required to support DoD, other Federal a gencies and partner nations engaged in counter drug and counter narco-terrorism operations throughout the world.  The Government intends to award no more than five (5) multiple award, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts with firm-fixed  price, labor rates and cost reimbursable contract line items (CLINs) for materials and other direct costs. The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification (HUBZone, 8(a), small, small disadvantaged, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, woman-owned, or large business) relative to North Amer ican Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (size standard of 1,000 employees).  PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS MUST HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO PERFORM ALL AREAS OF THE SCOPE OF WORK  (SOW). Contracted effort requires that all contractor employees possess at a minimum a Security Clearance Classification of Secret, with some requirements for both Top Secret and Top Secret-Special Compartmentalized Information (TS-SCI).  Some contracted effort m ay require secret storage. This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at the prime contractor level.  The proposed acquisition will include a conflict of interest solicitation provision and contract clause as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpa rt 9.5. As noted above the Government intends to award no more than five (5) contracts, but at this time it is unclear of the extent of anticipated small and small disadvantaged business participation, thus the responsible contracting officer has not decided upon the specific number and/or types of set-aside awards to targets during the development of this acquisition strategy.  Small businesses may team together (or even affiliate) and be eligible for award of a set-aside contract, PROVIDING THAT EACH TEAM MEMBER MEETS THE NAICS CODE SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD.  A small business team prime must demonstrate the ability to perform at least 51% of the effort.  However, a small business team may subcontract to large businesses for up to 49% of the effort. The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements (created by the affiliation of small businesses to form a prime) or subcontract arrangements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor could  propose as a prime contractor as well as participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams).  In accordance with applicable federal acquisition regulation guidance, companies normally form a contractor team arrangement before submitting an offer.  However, subject to when the arrangement occurs in the acquisition process and responsible contracting officer approval, if needed, vendors may enter into an arrangement later in the acquisition process, to include after contract award. This sources sought is to conduct market research and receive capability papers from interested businesses/teams.  RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:  Capability papers should include the following information:  size of company (i.e., 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB, SB, SDVOSB, Veteran, all others), number of employees, relevant past performance on same/similar work and your company/team capability to do this type of work.  Documentation and technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determin e that your company/team possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition.  Interested firms should submit via e-mail and attach the capability statement (Microsoft Word format) within 21 days after the date of this anno uncement to Mr. Joseph Cloft at joseph.cloft@smdc.army.mil (title email:  CNTPO and Technical Operations Support).  Capability papers should not exceed ten (10) 8 1/2 x 11 pages excluding cover page and index, font size not smaller than Times New Roman 10.   No pictures, charts or graphs shall be included except on the cover page or index page. All questions can be directed in writing to Mr. Cloft at joseph.cloft@smdc.army.mil (title email: CNTPO Questions).  If a solicitation is issued it will be announced at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement  separately from the responses to this announcement.  The submission of this information is for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any items and USASMDC does not intend to award on the basis of this re quest for information or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Capability papers should address that the contractor or contractor team has the demonstrated ability to perform the entire task. CNTPO is the technology program office working directly for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Counter Narcoterrorism (DASD-CN).  As noted above, CNTPOs mission includes providing technology support to DoD, other Federa l agencies and partner nations engaged in counter drug and counter narco-terrorism operations.  This is accomplished by working within the DoD and interagency environment to determine common mission requirements.  CNTPO leverages industry, academia, and go vernment laboratories to develop and deliver prototype and limited production systems.  Using a systems engineering approach, technologies are tested for compatibility in the operational environment and integrated into operational processes. Training and s ustainment are also included with the systems.  Protocols to deploy these technologies have been developed and multiple systems are in use with operational forces in the U.S. and partner nations.  Selected technologies are also in use with law enforcement organizations.  For further information, a public website is available at www.cntpo.com. The resulting contract effort to be performed under this requirement will provide the necessary goods and services to support the CNTPO mission, to include counter drug and counter-narcoterrorism activities undertaken by the U.S. Government, coalition part ners, and host nations.  Specifically, the summarized requirements discussed below outline the CNTPO required contractor support in the following areas:  Technology Development and Application Support; Training; Operations and Logistics Support; and Profes sional and Executive Support.  Further, the results from this synopsis will be used to assist in reviewing the requirements for Contractor-provided equipment and services to research, develop, upgrade, install, fabricate, test, deploy, operate, train, main tain, and support new and existing federal Government platforms, systems, subsystems, items, and host-nation support initiatives.

The NIST Speech Group conducts open evaluations of speech and language technologies. This procurement is part of an evaluation for speech transcription and machine translation for another Government agency. This procurement relates to the evaluation of machine translation (MT). The intended evaluation of the quality of the MT will be the number of edits necessary to make the MT output (1) have exactly the same meaning as the human reference translation and (2) be readily understandable. This work is for the provision of editors to perform this “post-editing” process. All editors must have an extremely high sensitivity to fine shades of meaning and polished skill at capturing that meaning with the absolute minimum number of edits. The MT outputs and reference data to be edited will be provided in a machine-readable, XML-based textual format, which will be read directly by editing software.

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with a single source under the authority of FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. Interested parties capable of responding to the requirement may submit a capability statement specifically identifying their ability to accomplish this requirement. Responses are due within ten days after publication of this notice. Responses shall be reviewed solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Scope of work
Purpose
The purpose of the Regional Connectivity Initiative is to enhance assessment of the implications of emerging unpredictable disasters and to effectively respond to them. This initiative will lead to better coordination of disaster responses among various government and international agencies and will also allow for various stakeholders to interact. 

The impact this will achieve is that lives and livelihoods will be more secure in woredas (districts) highly vulnerable to unpredictable shocks because responses to future threats will be made in a timelier manner in a fashion better adapted to local needs.

Objectives
1)	To interconnect the federal DPPA with its regional DPPA counterparts to allow for the sharing and integration of data collected at the local level.
2)	To enhance communication between the regional administration and woredas (districts).
3)	To enable DPPA and its partners (at district, zonal, regional and federal levels) to have the capacity and capability to respond in a timely and effective manner to unpredictable shocks based on adequate and timely early warning information
Performance Phasing

This will be a maximum two-year contract that will be incrementally funded. The successful completion of each part is required before subsequent financial commitments will be made. Phase 1 and Phase 2 (see below) will form the initial commitment.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subparts 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-06-Q-30010 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only. The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08.  This is an unrestricted procurement. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336413: size standard is 1000.  The contract will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR part 13.5.  The U.S. Coast Guard Aircraft Repair & Supply Center (ARSC) intends to award a single firm-fixed price contract.

Statement of work
The need exist for a CNC Tubing Bender that is capable of repeatable bending of tubes and pipe from ¼" up to 3" O.D. and of virtually any length.  These lines must be smooth in all bends, no wrinkles, or puckering, and involve bends exceeding 90- degrees.  The lines used on the C-130 vary in wall thickness and material depending on application.  During the USCG Progressive Structural Inspection process, heavy deport maintenance, the likelihood of having to replace numerous hydraulic, fuel, and oxygen lines exists.  Many of these lines are not in the supply system and are required to be locally manufactured.  A computer controlled system with the ability to enter a part numbers, bends, and material for the first line and the computer controlled system shall able to bend the same line months later without additional programming is a necessity to this program.  The ability to manufacture and produce these lines locally and without excessive programming or calculating will decrease the waiting for parts time considerably.  In addition to manufacturing lines for the PSI-B process, additional lines and tubes can be manufactured for the field units in need of these lines.

A requirement also exists to finish the ends of the tube lines and add beading or flaring.  Depending on application the tube/line will require a difference finish for the ends.  

Technical requirements: The tubing bender must have the following as a minimum:
1.	Ability to bend up to 3" aluminum tubing, with a wall thickness of .188 maximum
2.	Ability to bend up to 3" stainless steel tubing with a wall thickness of .065 maximum
3.	Capable of bending tubes/lines of varying wall thickness
4.	Make all bends smooth without wrinkling or puckering
5.	Electrically Powered by a 485  v 3 phase 25 horsepower motor
6.	PC Based Touch Screen Control
7.	On Screen Self Diagnostics
8.	Bending Program Storage & Recall with a minimum of 500 programs
9.	Automatic springback compensation
10.	Fully automatic mode of operation
11.	Hitch feed system to bend parts of any length.

HSAR 3052.209-70 Prohibition on contracts with corporate expatriates. 
As prescribed at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-75, insert the following clause: 
PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
 “Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 
 
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
 
Notice to Offerors:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two Years with three, one-year options
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Washington, D.C.
SECURITY ACCESS:  Secret

I. Introduction
The Program Office (PO) of the Bureau for Europe and Eurasia (E&E) directs the strategic planning, analysis, budget planning, program performance and evaluation processes for the 24 active country programs in the E&E region.  E&E/PO also has responsibility for ensuring that the E&E Bureau addresses key Administration and Congressional priorities and responds to USAID policy and program issues.  The Program office is composed of two divisions: (a) Strategic Planning and Analysis (SPA), and (b) Project Development and Budget Planning.  In FY 2005, E&E/PO supported management of $395 million in Assistance for Eastern Europe and the Baltic States (AEEB) and $565 million in Freedom Support Act (FSA) funds for the former Soviet Union.  

When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and the Soviet Union collapsed in late 1991, the Europe and Eurasia region became a new frontier for the United States Government.  The Congress responded by authoring the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 and the Freedom for Russia and Emerging Eurasian Democracies and Open Markets (FREEDOM) Support Act (FSA) of 1992.  From the inception of these acts, USAID has been the main federal agency managing programs to promote democracy and human rights, to introduce and institutionalize a market economy, and to alleviate the social and humanitarian problems in the former communist states of Europe and Eurasia.  USAID’s underlying objectives in Europe and Eurasia have been and continue to be freedom, peace, prosperity, and regional stability. USAID, through its Bureau for Europe and Eurasia (E&E), provides oversight of a comprehensive program of assistance to the states of the former Soviet Union and in Central and Eastern Europe.  The purpose of the assistance program is to promote the successful transition from communist rule to the establishment of market-oriented democracies with responsible social safety nets. 

The position is to be encumbered in the Strategic Planning and Analysis (SPA) division of the E&E Program office. The SPA Division is responsible for: 1) leading the development of the E&E Bureau’s strategic framework, sector plans and analytical agenda; 2) collaboration with the Department of State's Office of the Coordinator of U.S. Assistance to Europe and Eurasia (EUR/ACE) in overseeing Inter-Agency Country Assistance Reviews (ICAR), pre-strategy consultations, Mission Strategy Statement submissions and close out plan reviews,  3) preparation of written and oral Congressional testimony, and other Bureau-wide reporting, and 4) E&E Bureau representation in agency-wide initiatives on such matters as fragile states, counter-terrorism, military affairs, conflict mitigation management, donor coordination and the Millennium Challenge Account.   The SPA division also, as required, provides direct assistance to E&E missions through temporary duty (TDY) travel to the field.

The incumbent will require skills in analysis and monitoring of economic, social, and political conditions existing in the E&E region.  These skills are particularly important in organizing agency-wide reviews of Bureau and Mission policies and strategies for assistance, for designing programs that will advance that strategy, for learning from experience in program implementation, and for informing the graduation process.  Such analysis and monitoring will enhance the capacity of the Program Office to shape and articulate the Bureau’s collective vision, influence its participation in agency wide initiatives, and expand support for field operations. 

II. Duties and Responsibilities
The incumbent will provide a multi-disciplinary approach to monitoring and interpreting socio-political conditions in the region and assessing issues for program analysis and approval processes, preparation of Bureau-wide reporting, and E&E Bureau representation in agency-wide initiatives.  The incumbent will analyze and evaluate strategic aspects of country programs managed by field missions in the E&E region, and will direct the review and approval process on behalf of USAID/Washington for country-level assistance strategies.  

The incumbent will coordinate his/her work with:  each of the E&E Bureau technical offices, agency “pillar bureaus”, and the Department of State's Office of the Coordinator responsible for oversight of USAID’s assistance activities in Central and Eastern Europe and Eurasia; with the country affairs or “Desk” offices which track development programs in the target countries; and with the USAID missions serving those countries.

The incumbent will be expected to prepare a range of analyses, decision memoranda, and reporting to the E&E Bureau front office and to organizations with oversight responsibility for US foreign assistance, including the Congress, OMB, and the Department of State. 

III. Statement of Work
Under the supervision of the SPA Division Chief and with guidance from the Director of E&E’s Program Office, the incumbent will:

Strategies and Reviews:
•	In consultation with E&E technical offices, USAID pillar bureaus, and the State Department Coordinator for FSA and SEED, lead the strategy consultative processes for assigned Mission pre-strategy and strategy reviews, budget reviews, phase-out reviews, close-out plans, and other E&E Bureau-chaired reviews as necessary.  Review proposed assistance strategies and recommend approval or changes by taking into account the economic state of the country, political and social conditions, development plans, ands programs and priorities of other donors.  The incumbent also considers U.S. foreign policy objectives, legislative requirements, and USAID strategy. 
•	For pre-strategy consultations, this will require soliciting issues from a wide range of stakeholders; determining which issues are most critical for shaping the overall assistance strategic direction; and facilitating a compromise on points of disagreement between the field and Washington offices both during the consultations and in the course of preparing the parameters cable that provides guidance to the mission for development of their strategy statement.  
•	For approval of Mission strategy statements, the incumbent will similarly seek comments from the wide range of stakeholders; determine which comments require revisions to the strategy and suggest means of modifying the strategy statement to reconcile differences in perspective.   In determining how to reconcile difference in perspective, the incumbent will consider empirical data and qualitative assessments on country performance, consultation with other USAID and Department of State offices, and reference to applicable USAID regulations governing the review and approval of mission strategy statements.  
•	Manage a process for finalizing approval of assigned “sector strategies” that will include one or more of the following: health, democracy, social transition, market transition, and infrastructure and energy.  Similar to the process for managing approval of mission strategies, this will require soliciting issues, facilitating resolution of disagreements, and documenting decisions made to assist “technical offices” within the E&E Bureau finalize “sector strategies” intended to help guide Mission programming.
•	He or she will also represent the E&E Bureau at the Inter-Agency Country Assistance Reviews (ICAR) chaired by the Department of State and conducted in the field. Each of these tasks entails wide latitude of independent judgment in determining appropriate guidance to resolve differences in perspective between the field and the AID/W or State Department office sponsoring an issue for consideration.

Bureau Analytical Agenda:
•	The E&E Bureau Analytical Agenda encompasses both empirical and qualitative research relevant to program decision-making.  The incumbent will identify possible topics for the agenda.  As needed, develop scopes of work for empirical analyses or sector assessments.  Oversee the implementation of specific studies and disseminate findings in a manner relevant to the E&E bureau and field missions.

Country-Specific Tasks:
•	The incumbent will be assigned one or more countries to backstop.  This will entail gaining a detailed understanding of country performance, program accomplishments and challenges, and strategic direction and budget decision-making.  This expertise will strengthen E&E Bureau strategic planning, oversight capacity, deepen support for field missions, and facilitate the compilation of lessons learned for wider application. 
•	Develop and/or review country-specific information related to various bureau and Agency documents (e.g. Budget Justification Documents to Congress, FSA or SEED reports, Bureau Program Budget Submission, etc.).
•	Monitor, identify, and report on country and regional performance trends.

Other:
•	Develop and maintain relationships with various stakeholders in USAID and other Federal agencies.  Actively participate in policy formulation discussions and conduct liaison activities and briefings on E&E strategy and programs.   
•	Support E&E understanding of, participation in and strategic response to agency-wide cross-cutting initiatives, such as the emerging discipline of security and development and the increased role of development assistance in counter-terrorism and military affairs.
•	Undertake special assignments or respond to intermittent work requirements identified by the Director of E&E’s Program Office, his/her designee, or other Bureau Senior Management.
•	Develop a variety of documents ranging from the Bureau Budget Justification Document, the Bureau Program Budget Submission, Congressional testimony, speeches for the AA/E&E and DAAs/E&E, etc.
•	Gather data from E&E technical offices and Missions for E&E’s submission to USAID’s Performance and Accountability Report (PAR), OMB’s Performance and Accountability Rating Tool (PART), and other USAID performance reports. 

IV. Decision Making
The incumbent will be a Senior Program Advisor that is considered an expert that has been consulted by other experts and who can perform under general administrative discretion with wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment, work of outstanding difficulty and responsibility; and has formal decision making authority in broad area of democratic governance and conflict related strategic programming choices. 

V. Level of Complexity
Tracking country specific and regional trends and integrating that information into strategic directions for the E&E Bureau entails a highly complex assignment. The incumbent will collect information from a variety of sources, interpret it and represent the Bureau in high level meetings in order to convey the basis of Bureau strategy to those inside and outside of the Bureau. Developments in the E&E region in the fields of democracy and conflict mitigation are extremely dynamic and require excellent understanding of different methodological approaches as well as fine judgment and analysis as to their levels of importance in regard to USAID programs and the interests of the US Government as a whole.  

VI. Knowledge Level Required
The position demands mastery of democracy and conflict related programming but assignments are complicated by interconnected issues, multi-disciplinary approaches, conflicts among possible technical solutions, etc.     It is desirable that the incumbent possess the following:

•	Comprehensive knowledge of USAID’s country program strategy and planning systems, as well as a thorough working knowledge of the Agency’s project design and implementation systems.
•	Thorough working knowledge of U.S. foreign aid legislation and trends and Executive Branch policies and directions.
•	Broad knowledge of relevant economic and social issues of the transition countries
•	Solid knowledge of USAID management systems and administrative procedures.
•	Ability to apply experimental theories and new developments to problems not susceptible to accepted methods

VII. Supervisory Controls  
The incumbent will take direction from and report to the Chief of the Strategic Planning and Analysis Division as well as the Director of E&E’s Program Office. The incumbent’s supervisors provide general direction and broad guidance pertaining to the analytical agenda of the E&E Bureau. The supervisor informally follows work progress and reviews it for fulfillment of Bureau priorities, objectives and overall goals, as well as for consistency and conformance to Agency policy. The incumbent independently plans, designs and carries out projects, studies and programs. There is no higher level official technically responsible for conducting these types of analyses or for providing related technical program guidance to the missions.

VIII. Guidelines
Broad guidelines include the Freedom Support and SEED Acts; Foreign Assistance Act as amended; appropriation acts; report parameters as set by the State Department Coordinators Office (in particular, the country phase-out guidelines); and USAID directives and policies.  In addition, various Agency strategies that will help guide analysis include the Fragile States Strategy, the Anticorruption Strategy, the White Paper, and the E&E Anticorruption Framework TAPEE. However, the incumbent will be required to use judgment and ingenuity to interpret the intent of the guidelines and to develop professional and expert analyses and strategic inputs. 

IX. Complexity of Work Environment
Work is performed in a typical office setting.  The incumbent will be required occasionally to undertake short to medium duration international travel to locations within the E&E Bureau geographical area that may entail some physical hardships. Because of the need for quick response and creativity in complex situations, the incumbent is expected to operate with autonomy, responsibility and authority. The sensitive nature of the work demands that the incumbent be an individual with good skills of social interaction and a skilled interpreter of politically charged situations.     Since work may require continued changes in program direction, implementation and coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.

X. Scope and Effect of Work
Assignments reflect wide program area; projects range from regional to national, impacting areas that an individual with high level managerial and operational skills can handle, and the incumbent must be available to be sent out quickly to perform specific advisory functions in the field. The incumbent will be involved in critical program activity for measuring and assessing the impact of USAID activities throughout the E&E region. Information and analysis is also used for developing briefing materials for senior Bureau officials, assisting with responses to congressional inquiries, and providing information outside the Bureau.    

Bureau analysis and input are critical to Congress and the Coordinator Offices in State Department who oversee development activities in the geographical region. The incumbent is recognized as an expert on the region to other similar experts and his/her work affects the work of other experts.     Providing effective program/project strategies for the range of countries in the E&E region establishes the basis for self-sustaining activities in the recipient region, thereby positively affecting the living conditions and well-being of a substantial number of people.

XI. Level and Purpose of Contacts
Given the central and coordinating role of the Program Office in the development of strategies in the region, the incumbent will be expected to collaborate with a wide range of senior management officials, within USAID (within E&E as well as other Bureaus, pillar and geographic bureaus; in Washington and in the field) and within the USG community more broadly (in the State Department primarily) and among other donors and organizations.  These contacts and collaboration are needed to ensure coordination and synergies among USAID programs in the region and with other key players in the foreign aid community.  The overall purpose of contact is to influence, motivate, control or direct people or groups to reach a consensus on the resolution of issues at high levels, both inside and outside the Agency; employ appropriate approaches for negotiating with and persuading others regarding difficult and strategic DG program decisions; determine the appropriateness and effectiveness of USAID assistance in the Missions; develop complimentarity among donors in assistance efforts; provide guidance on program design and implementation and provide briefings on the status of programs.


XIII. Supervision/Oversight of Others
The incumbent will not have supervisory responsibilities.

XIV. Minimum Qualification Requirements

Education
•	A master’s degree in the fields of international development, social sciences or equivalent.


Relevant Work Experience
•	A minimum of six (6) years of professional experience and project management in international development
•	Experience working on problems of democratic and market transitions in the Europe/Eurasia region

XV. Selective Evaluation Factors

•	30 points -- Experience working and communicating with US foreign policy agencies, American embassies, or related NGOs, overseas to achieve critical, high profile objectives 
•	30 points -- Experience designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating foreign assistance programs
•	20 points -- Experience operating independently in complex political situations in pre/post-conflict countries or countries undergoing political transitions 
•	20 points – Excellent writing and interpersonal communication experience and skills, demonstrating an ability to foster E&E Bureau relationships with key partners, stakeholders and beneficiaries both within and without the USG, and in multi-disciplinary teams from all walks of life and varying geographic and political environments

Instructions to Offerors-Commercial (JAN 2005) The offeror must complete the annual representations and certifications electronically via the ORCA website at http://orca.bpn.gov. After reviewing the ORCA database information, the offeror verifies by submission of this offer that the representations and certifications currently posted electronically at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, have been entered or updated in the last 12 months, are current, accurate, complete, and applicable to this solicitation (including business size standard applicable to the NAICS code referenced for this solicitation), as of the date of this offer and are incorporated in this offer by reference (see FAR 4.1201); FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items As prescribed in 12.301 (c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows: EVALUATION—COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

C.  Teaming/Subcontracting Relationships.  If an Offeror’s quote includes Teaming Partners or Subcontractors, then the Offeror is required to supply to the Government, along with its quote, a copy of the Teaming Arrangement or other document that identifies which partner/subcontractor shall be responsible for performing which requirements.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

1.  Past Performance and Experience.  The Government will evaluate offeror’s past performance and experience to determine whether the vendor consistently delivers quality products and services in a timely manner.  This factor will be evaluated on the basis of relevant past performance and experience for each offeror. 
Each quote is required to describe a minimum of three but not more than five prior relevant projects that the offeror has completed or are ongoing which are similar in scope and size to this requirement.  Include points of contact and their phone numbers, and titles, size of procurement in dollar value and e-mail addresses if possible.  Each reference shall include a contracting and technical point of contact.  
If the offeror’s quote includes teaming partners or subcontractors, then the information above required of the offeror on three to five relevant projects shall be similarly required of each teaming partner/subcontractor. 
If the offeror’s quote includes teaming partners or subcontractors, then the Government shall evaluate each partner’s/subcontractor’s individual past performance and experience and average the evaluations together for an overall Team past performance and experience evaluation.  In evaluating a teaming partner’s or subcontractor’s past performance in a particular type of work, the Government may consider whether the teaming partner whose past performance or experience is touted will be performing that work, as evidenced by the terms of the quote and the Teaming Arrangement or other document provided per paragraph C above.
The information presented in the vendor’s quote, together with information from any other sources available to the Government (i.e., Government-controlled Contractor performance databases, Inspector General reports, General Accounting Office reports, newspaper articles, references including contractual and end-user representatives, etc.) will provide the input for evaluation of this factor.  The past performance and experience information should include the vendor’s record of providing high quality services in a timely manner, standards of good workmanship, adhering to contract schedules, administrative aspects of contract performance, overall quality of assigned personnel, availability, stability, reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to and business-like concern for the interests of the customer, quality of overall program management approach, record of awards or performance recognition earned, and overall client satisfaction.  Past performance and experience that is relevant to this requirement will be of more value than non-relevant past performance and experience.  Offerors will be evaluated on examples of past performance and experience wherein the experience of the vendor has contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.  Offerors will be evaluated on examples of past performance and experience wherein the infrastructure and resources of the vendor contributed to the success of similar contracts/task orders.  A lack of relevant past performance and experience data will be treated by the Government as a neutral evaluation.  Past performance and experience will be evaluated to determine contractor’s suitability for meeting the objectives of the requirement.  

2. The Offer’s price quote will be evaluated for reasonableness. 

This is a best value procurement.  Past performance and experience is more important than price.  

In the event one contractor cannot provide the full coverage in all locations, multiple awards may be considered by the government.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items As prescribed in 12.301(b)(2), insert the following provision: OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS—COMMERCIAL ITEMS (MAR 2005)

<DESC>Scope of work
Purpose
The purpose of the Regional Connectivity Initiative is to enhance assessment of the implications of emerging unpredictable disasters and to effectively respond to them. This initiative will lead to better coordination of disaster responses among various government and international agencies and will also allow for various stakeholders to interact. 

The impact this will achieve is that lives and livelihoods will be more secure in woredas (districts) highly vulnerable to unpredictable shocks because responses to future threats will be made in a timelier manner in a fashion better adapted to local needs.

Objectives
1)	To interconnect the federal DPPA with its regional DPPA counterparts to allow for the sharing and integration of data collected at the local level.
2)	To enhance communication between the regional administration and woredas (districts).
3)	To enable DPPA and its partners (at district, zonal, regional and federal levels) to have the capacity and capability to respond in a timely and effective manner to unpredictable shocks based on adequate and timely early warning information
Performance Phasing

This will be a maximum two-year contract that will be incrementally funded. The successful completion of each part is required before subsequent financial commitments will be made. Phase 1 and Phase 2 (see below) will form the initial commitment.

Please contact the CO for the full solicitation.

See Numbered Note 1.    
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:
PAST PERFORMANCE
PRICE

Past performance is more important than price.  

The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the proposal of an quoter with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  If an quoter fails to provide any past performance information which is similar in scope, magnitude and complexity to that which is detailed in the RFQ or fails to affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance, the quote may not be awardable.   The Government will consider the quality of quoter’s past performance.  This consideration is separate and distinct from the Contracting Officer’s responsibility determination.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the quoter and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  In determining the rating for the past performance evaluation factor, the Government will give greater consideration to the contracts which the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.  Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation (system features and accessories, total system offered). Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.

Answer 5:  No, an additional plan just for disasters is not necessary. Disaster phones should be provided at no additional cost.  Phones should be shipped and signed for by a staff member before deployment and returned to vendor at the end of deployment.

Question 6:  Are the "disaster phones" you refer to, satellite phones?

Answer 6:  Disaster phones are not required to be satellite phones.  The disaster phones can be the regular cell phone that individuals typically have for personal use.

Question 7:  Are you expecting A*NCCC to have possession of these "disaster phones" year round only to be used in national disasters? 

Answer 7:  Disaster phones will be requested for prior to deployment to the disaster sites and returned after the deployment is over--A*NCCC will not keep disaster phones year round.
