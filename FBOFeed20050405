B. Full text of announcement

The Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for Brood of Spectrum Supremacy (BOSS), a new program to develop software coordination managers that provide coordination support to fielded human units, e.g., tactical teams. In addition to this BAA and before submitting proposals, a prospective offeror MUST refer to the BOSS Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) located at the DARPA website, http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicitations/solicitations.htm for further information. The BOSS PIP contains additional details on the program objectives, application space, program description, evaluation plans and metrics, program scope, general information, submission process, reporting requirements and procedures, proposal format, evaluation and funding processes, and administrative addresses. Additionally, all information MUST be handled in accordance with the BOSS Security Classification Guide (SCG), which is available to eligible contractors. Refer herein to paragraph IV. 2. c. or the BOSS PIP for instructions on how to obtain a copy of the BOSS SCG.

I.  Funding Opportunity Description 
PROGRAM SCOPE DARPA.
1.1	BROOD OF SPECTRUM SUPREMACY (BOSS) 
Cooperative use of computational and software-defined radio capabilities, in aggregate, offer the potential for breakthrough capabilities in warfighter situational awareness. Therefore, by using software-defined radios, the goal of the BOSS program is to provide a radio frequency (RF) spectrum analogue to night vision capabilities for the tactical warfighter, with a particular focus on RF-rich urban operations. 

1.1.1	BOSS TECHNICAL AREAS. The capabilities of interest to DARPA are:
a.	Mobile Distributed Receivers for military applications, e.g., local-area radars, local-area bistatic radars and geolocation.
b.	Cooperative close-in detection, location and characterization of RF emitters in an urban environment.
c.	Network understanding, based on cooperative observation and analysis of adversary communications by multiple distributed nodes.

While these capabilities are of interest, other imaginative proposals for mobile software radios operating as an aggregate are strongly encouraged in this initial solicitation.

1.1.2	BOSS CHALLENGES:
a.	Developing a theoretical analysis of the tradespace for the proposed capability in the face of varying numbers of moving elements of varying capabilities (e.g., RF and processing) at varying distances and locations.
b.	Working within the software-defined radio tradespace to refine the capabilities of Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant platforms.
c.	Validating algorithms and implementations for network understanding tasks that could, for example, identify likely commanders and command posts.

1.1.3	BOSS PROGRAMMATICS AND SCHEDULING. Proposals should be for a base period of 12 months (Phase I). Proposers are encouraged to provide for optional tasks to pursue efforts in Phase II (18 months), Phase III (18 months) and Phase IV (12 months). Funding beyond Phase I will be subject to satisfactory progress of BOSS research toward achieving goal metrics described below, and DARPA priorities. 

BOSS Phase I activities will be focused on modeling and simulation, resulting in hardware independent executable specifications of waveforms in a MATLAB format. These waveform specifications will be evaluated as a basis for the BOSS program entering Phase II. Phase II is focused on implementing a prototype demonstration capability for an RF platform chosen by the proposer, with the implementation accompanied by hardware independent executable specifications of the waveforms. The demonstrated capability will serve as the basis for the BOSS program entering Phase III. Phase III will focus on SCA compliant waveforms suitable for implementation on a tactical software radio system. Based on performance of the capability, one or more of the capabilities will be integrated and transitioned as a set in Phase IV. 

To support the evaluation of program metrics, offerors must explicitly state in their proposals a plan for providing deliverables including, but not limited to, documentation for building and installation, user manuals, and support for evaluation by the Independent Test and Evaluation (ITE) Team.

1.1.4 	BOSS INTEGRATION. The BOSS Program will have one or more systems integrators whose tasks will focus on software portability, maintenance, validation and partnering in merging of the software capabilities onto a common platform (if the earlier phases of the effort are successful). Since technical performer software deliverables will be covered by the BOSS Program security classification guide, the system integrator must possess facilities appropriate for storage of documents and software at the Top Secret level.

1.2	BOSS SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
The BOSS program will require access up to U.S. TOP SECRET information.  A program Security Classification Guide (SCG) for this program is available on request and required for guidance on proposal preparation.  Performers must have required U.S. personnel clearances, cleared facilities, storage, and processing capabilities to bid on this solicitation.  Please see administrative contact information in the PIP for details on receiving the SCG.

Performers should include a plan for secure communications between team members and the government to include secure voice and data as necessary.  Plans should detail what equipment will be requisitioned or purchased, the timeframes for obtaining and setting up secure communications networks and contingency plans.  Proposals containing classified information from another sponsor must seek prior approval from the sponsor before including the information.  Instructions for sending classified material to DARPA are included in the PIP. Additionally, innovative proposals dealing with non-collateral classification levels will be considered on a case by case basis. Offerors desiring to submit proposals that are classified at non-collateral levels should contact the BOSS Government Security Officer listed below.

1.3	BOSS PUBLIC RELEASE
Any public release of information will be governed by the DD Form 254 invoked by an award, the requirements of which will be levied upon all sub-contractors or consultants.  

1.4	BOSS GOAL METRICS
The metrics for the BOSS Program will be discussed at the BOSS Industry Day.

1.5	INDEPENDENT TEST AND EVALUATION (ITE)
The independent test and evaluator will be responsible for assessing progress toward the BOSS goal metrics for each phase of the program. This is not a solicitation for proposals to perform independent test and evaluation tasks. 

II. Award Information 
The Government reserves the right to select all, some portion, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options.

III. Eligibility Information
1.  Eligible Applicants

This BAA solicits proposals from all interested and qualified sources. All participants and/or individuals must meet security clearance requirements as determined in the program Security Classification Guide (SCG) for the BOSS Program and comply with any necessary non-disclosure agreements, security regulations, export laws, and other governing statutes that would be applicable under the circumstances.  Finally, the SCG for the BOSS Program is authoritative on all security requirements and guidance.  In the event of discrepancies between information presented in this announcement and the BOSS SCG, the BOSS SCG takes precedence. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.

Offerors should also provide a plan for transition of appropriate technology components and information to the user community.
 (5)	Cost Realism:  The overall estimated costs should be clearly justified and appropriate for the technical complexity of the effort.  Evaluation will consider the value of the research to the government and the extent to which the proposed management plan will effectively allocate resources to achieve the capabilities proposed
2.  Review and Selection Process
It is the policy of DARPA to ensure impartial, equitable, comprehensive evaluation of all proposals and to select the source (or sources) whose offer meets the Government’s technical and policy goals. Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review of each proposal, using the above criteria. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other, since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. DARPA's intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive; however, proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled for administrative purposes by support contractors. These support contractors are prohibited from competition in DARPA technical research and are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are also bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. However, non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as Government Only.   Use of non-government personnel is covered in FAR 37.203(d).

<DESC>The Combat Sustainment Wing at Warner Robins Air Logistics Center will acquire nonrecurring engineering and materials necessary for redesign, retrofit and/or production of enhanced factory test equipment applicable to the A/A24A-56 Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS).  The following initiatives will be accomplished under this effort:

Electronics Unit (EU) Factory Test Equipment (UUT NSN 1270-01-460-5254, P/N 620100-01-21, or NSN 1270-01-521-4920, P/N 620100-01-22; EU Factory Test Equipment is not currently stock listed)

The EU tester will be redesigned to facilitate (1) test of two single seat EU’s, (2) test of a dual seat EU, (3) drive of two single seat EU’s of during environmental stress screening, and (4) drive of a dual seat EU during environmental stress screening .  The redesign will eliminate obsolete tester components and eliminate the need for any secondary EU system level testing through incorporation of simulated JHMCS prime mission hardware.  Successful completion will include the production of two new redesigned EU test sets and re-baseline of the EU acceptance test procedure.  Anticipated final delivery is 18 months after receipt of contract.  Upgrade of the existing inventory of EU Testers will be incorporated by use of priced contract options.

Display Unit (DU) Factory Test Equipment (UUT NSN 1240-01-469-6497, P/N 620520-01-05; DU Factory Test Equipment is not currently stock listed)

The purpose for this effort is to provide a redesigned test system for performing manufacturing test procedures and contractual acceptance testing for Display Units and spare Cathode Ray Tube assemblies.  The redesigned system will provide enhanced characterization/accuracy measurement (CRT/Relay Optics Characterization, Static Accuracy, Pupper Display Accuracy, Pupil Size and Offset, Inter Pupil Distance Range, Field of View, Stability Radian Error, and Camera Offset), enhanced focus and line width measurement (Focus Measurement and Stroke Line Width C/E) and a capability for luminance measurement (Brightness Characterization, Pupper Display Brightness, Stroke Luminance Uniformity, and Automatic Brightness Control.  The enhanced system will provide improved production efficiencies by lowering test cycle times and multiplying production throughput capability by a factor of two.  Successful completion will include the production of two new redesigned DU test sets and re-baseline of the EU acceptance test procedure.  Anticipated final delivery is 18 months after receipt of contract.

Solicitation will be sole source to Vision Systems International, Incorporated, 641 River Oaks Parkway, San Jose CA 95134-1907 (CAGE 06VL3) pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c)(1).

<CONTACT>Mary Hines  850-235-5389  , or Contracting Officer Marjorie Dulatt at 850-235-5398.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL, (NSWC PC) intends to solicit competitive proposals from foreign sources, under the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) program, for the detailed design, fabrication and delivery of an LCAC propeller shroud made from composite materials.  These items will be evaluated under the LCAC FCT program as possible candidates for use on the LCAC. The LCAC Composite Shroud would be comprised of a cylindrical airfoil surrounding the propeller that provides structural support for the propeller and associated shafting via five aerodynamically designed stators connecting the propeller centerbody to the shroud inner skin.  The shroud interfaces with various other LCAC equipments including the LCAC rudders, which are mounted on the aft end of the shroud.  The shroud application is weight sensitive and weight will be given special consideration in the final selection process. The shroud operates in an extreme! ly harsh marine environment including constant spray of salt and sand; therefore, design and construction must account for this environment. This requirement may result in possible multiple contracts subject to availability of funding.  NSWC PC intends to provide access to an LCAC prior to release of the solicitation starting the week of 04 April 2005 through 09 May 2005. Submit visit requests using the visit request form to Mr. Richard Childress, Code E31, e-mail richard.childress@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>J--Refurbishment of Rigid Inflatable Boats
<SOLNBR>N6133105R0042
<RESPDATE>053105
<ARCHDATE>06302005
<CONTACT>Mary Hines  850-235-5389  , or Contracting Officer Marjorie Dulatt at 850-235-5398.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole source contract to United States Marine Incorporated (USMI) to provide total refurbishment of Naval Special Warfare (NSW) 11 meter Rigid Inflatable Boats (RIB).  The contract will be for one year with four options of one year each.  The NSW RIB is a high-speed, high-buoyancy all weather boat specifically designed to transport a fully equipped team of eight Navy SEALs and three crew members on short-range insertion and extraction missions.  Only USMI can perform the refurbishments for the following reasons.  In early summer of 1997, the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) awarded a contract to USMI to manufacture the NSW RIB. USMI has been the only source of the NSW RIB since that time.  This acquisition provides for the total refurbishment of major systems as well as the incorporation of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to the NSW 11 meter RIBs.  As the sole developer and original eq! uipment manufacturer (OEM), USMI is the only source with sufficient in-depth knowledge of the NSW RIB that could conceivably implement the refurbishment.  Additionally, the NSW RIB was procured as a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) item.  As a COTS item, the Government did not procure a full technical data package (TDP) with the hardware at that time.  The lack of a TDP, combined with USMIs proprietary console improvements and lamination procedures as well as a warranty extension, makes the refurbishment of the NSW RIB by a contractor other than the OEM extremely difficult.  Use of another company to conduct the refurbishment may introduce new, or change existing parameters that may induce unacceptable performance characteristics into the NSW RIB.    Furthermore there is a high risk that changes/deviations could be introduced into the NSW RIB that would greatly reduce its operating capabilities, center of gravity, weight, shock and vibration requirements, and airdrop capabili! ties.  Any changes in any of these parameters would greatly reduce the NSW RIBs ability to meet mission requirements.  NAICS Code is 336612.  SBA Size Standard is 500 employees.  Product Service Code is J019.  Numbered Note 22 applies to this announcement.  NSWC Panama City plans on releasing the solicitation electronically only.   Solicitations and any Amendments may be downloaded from the following web sites, NSWC, NECO, and FEDBIZOPPS.   No Solicitations or Amendments will be mailed to offerors.  Therefore, it is incumbent upon the potential offeror to be cognitive of the NSWC Panama City Internet, NECO or FEDBIZOPPS for all releases.   Shipment will be FOB destination to, Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, and Fl 32407-7001.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for research into the feasibility of utilizing various miniature diodes and x-ray detectors for x-ray backscatter.  The research will also consider simultaneous system improvements such as shielding that would accompany new detectors.  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from the University of Florida Office of Engineering Research.  An X-ray backscatter is now used to help identify flaws in sprayed on foam insulation used on the External Tanks made at NASA Michoud.  That system is bulky and unwieldy and unable to inspect small tight hard to reach areas.  This research will help define a next generation x-ray backscatter capability that will be smaller and easier to use than the current systems in use for sprayed on foam insulation at Michoud.  The University of Florida faculty have been performing research in x-ray backscatter methods for in excess of twenty years.  They are the current developers of the existing x-ray backscatter system in use at Michoud and MSFC. The University of Florida, as a leader in this field of research, is the best possible provider of research in this field to partner with in  pursuit of this technology. Because of their proprietary technologies (Univ. of Florida controls numerous patents on this technology) and to maintain compatibility with the existing systems in use by NASA, contracting with University of Florida is in the best interests of the NASA.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 11, 2005.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Vision is: 		To improve life here, 		     To extend life to there, 			  To find life beyond. As Discovery and Atlantis are readied for their respective Return to Flight Missions, NASA is preparing to meet public demand to see the launches and missions.  NASA’s primary method for disseminating content is via the NASA Web Portal (www.nasa.gov).  Based on data from previous missions (Mars Exploration Rover Mission, Huygens Landing, etc…) we expect 20 to 30 million visits to the NASA Web Portal with 250,000 to 500,000 Internet users also accessing NASA TV coverage via Web Streaming.   In the existing portal infrastructure, if this demand increase materializes, NASA may:	      1. Cap the number of visitors and hours of web streaming coverage.  This would force visitors to find content from other venues that may or may not cover the Return to Flight Missions.      2. Increase NASA’s bandwidth coverage under NASA’s existing contract to support the NASA Portal to meet the increased demand. NASA is releasing this announcement to solicit proposals from Non-NASA entities to support option 2 by sponsoring the bandwidth costs associated with increasing public access for the Return to Flight Missions.   In exchange for this sponsorship NASA will consider offers to display the logo of the sponsor(s) and give credit to the sponsor(s) on the NASA Web Portal for the contribution of bandwidth costs.  NASA will consider other suitable innovative concepts to acknowledge and publicize the Offeror’s sponsorship.  NASA intends to enter into a Space Act Agreement with the selected sponsor and the existing NASA Web Portal contractor to cover these actions.	The selected sponsor(s) will in turn enter into an agreement with the existing NASA Web Portal contractor to pay for the associated costs of the bandwidth or a portion thereof. This Announcement is open through April 13, 2005.   NASA will not issue paper copies of this announcement.	NASA reserves the right to select for Space Act Agreement all, some or none of the proposals in response to this announcement.  NASA provides no funding for reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Material submitted in response to this Announcement will not be returned.  It is the policy of NASA to safeguard all proposals as confidential and privileged information and NASA will not, without permission of the Offeror, use or disclose their contents for other than evaluation purposes.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is soliciting proposals from organizations to provide SPNS Grantees Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Evaluation Study.  The contractor shall develop and implement a cost-effectives analysis (CEA) evaluation of three current SPNS initiatives and its service delivery models currently being evaluated. The NAICS Code is 541990 with a small business standard of 6.0 million.   The SPNS Program is considered the research and development arm of the Ryan White CARE Act. SPNS assesses the effectiveness of innovative models of HIV care, supports the development of these models, and promotes the replication of effective models of care.  The SPNS Program provides an opportunity to the HIV care community to develop innovative services by providing funding and expertise for grantees to evaluate innovations and disseminate findings to the HIV community. Today, a portfolio of 74 grants, funded either solely by the HIV/AIDS Bureau or in partnership with other Federal agencies address tomorrow’s issues in HIV care.  SPNS grantees are funded among different type of HIV care settings.  Approximately twenty-nine percent (29%) of SPNS grantees belong to university clinics, 26% to Community Clinics, 17% are Evaluation and Technical Assistance Centers, 15% belong to local or State Health Departments, 7% are Community Based Organizations, and 6% are from private or Non-Profit Organizations. SPSN grantees serve a variety of different sub-populations including communities of color and underserved highly in need of HIV care services. Our current priorities include: Supporting the coordination and integration of existing services for Native Americans/Alaska Natives living with HIV and other co-morbidities, Developing models of community-based health care networks that effectively reduce barriers to early identification of HIV disease and assure entry to high quality primary health care for individuals who live and/or work in the U.S. region of the U.S./Mexico border area, Evaluating the effectiveness of integrating Buprenorphine opioid abuse treatment into HIV primary care settings; Assessing interventions targeting HIV-positive individuals in clinical care, to prevent transmission to uninfected individuals and to prevent re-infection among people who are already infected with the virus; Identifying and evaluating effective models of outreach to underserved HIV positive people not in care; improving care and treatment of HIV+ persons of Caribbean descent by evaluating community-based peer programs that are serving people living with HIV who are underserved and of Caribbean origin; Assessing the extent to which information applied in various HIV care settings, can contribute to measurable and sustainable improvements in the delivery, quality and cost-effectiveness of care for people living with HIV (PLWH), especially among communities of color and underserved populations; Supporting the development and evaluation of innovative service models designed to reach HIV-infected young MSM not engaged in clinical care and to link them to appropriate clinical, supportive, and preventive services; Improving the quality of HIV care and Collaborating with CDC on interventions for HIV-positive substance abuse users and continuity of care for incarcerated individuals.  A prospective award will be developed and implemented for a cost-effectiveness analysis evaluation of three current SPNS initiatives.  The first is the Outreach and Intervention initiative, begun in 2001, as a two-phased five-year program of ten projects refining and evaluating current outreach strategies for bringing HIV-positive individuals into comprehensive continual care.  The second initiative is Outreach, Care and Prevention Initiative to Engage HIV Seropositive Young MSM (Men who have sex with men) of Color, which began in 2004.This is a five-year program to develop and evaluate service models among eight grantees designed to reach HIV-infected young MSM not engaged in clinical care and to link them to appropriate clinical, supportive, and preventive services.  The third initiative is Models of Peer Support for Caribbean’s living in the United States.   Information on each of the SPNS initiatives is available at: http://hab.hrsa.gov/special/evaluation2g.htm.    The Government anticipates award of a contract consisting of a thirty six -month’s Basic period.  This is a pre-solicitation notice and not a request for proposals.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 524292   "Child Care Tuition Assistance Program Administration" The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) is conducting market research, FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, to identify small and/or small disadvantaged businesses that possess  the necessary capabilities to provide support in disbursing Agency funds for EPA's child care tuition assistance program for  EPA's Office of Human Resources and Organizational Services. Background The contractor will administer the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) child care tuition  assistance program.  Congress passed Public Law 107-67, Section 630 on November 12, 2001, which permits federal agencies to assist their lower income federal employees with the costs of child care.  Tuition assistance can reduce the amount of tuition parents pay for child care by providing  subsidies directly to the child care provider.  To be eligible to participate, a child care provider must be a family child care home or child care center.  Both types of care must be licensed and/or regulated by the State and/or local authorities where the service is provided. General Scope of  Work EPA requires a contractor with the ability to receive a specified sum of money from the Agency and distribute it to child care providers as tuition assistance funds.  Specifically, the contractor shall  process tuition assistance applications and make a determination of eligibility and  tuition assistance amount based on family income, notify the parents and child care providers of the percentage of tuition assistance that each family will receive, notify employees if they have been, or if they have not been accepted into the program, and maintain confidential all information  contained in tuition assistance applications, and disburse Agency funds to approved applicants.

Therefore, the Capabilities Statement should realistically demonstrate how the small  business concern would be able to comply with this clause which would be included in any potential contract.  Please also note that consultants are considered subcontractors and not employees of the prime contractor. Interested small business concerns who believe they have the capability of  providing services as defined in the SOW are invited to submit, in writing, a Capabilities Statement with sufficient information within a 15 page limitation.

<DESC>Draft Request for Proposals (RFP) Number 0520000A for Trade Repository Analytical Development Environment (TRADE) is hereby released on this website for industry comments.   

The Commission previously issued an RFI/draft RFQ with the same title on this website on December 22, 2004 (Reference Number – CFTC-05-GS1).  The previous draft RFQ was intended only for Federal Supply Schedule vendors and is hereby replaced and superseded by the current draft RFP.  The Commission now contemplates full and open competition for this requirement.  

The Commission currently operates an Exchange Database System (“EDBS”), which processes and maintains information on all trades executed on U.S. futures exchanges.  The EDBS was developed to provide investigators, futures trading specialists, and economists with a mechanism to obtain reports and other relevant information for profiles of traders in each trading pit, trade practice investigations and other kinds of analyses based on trade data received from the exchanges.  The Commission wishes to replace EDBS with a new solution to be defined by the Contractor.  The draft RFP contains a Statement of Objectives as the basis for a complete, firm fixed price solution to be implemented and operated and maintained by the Contractor over a period of ten years, including options.   The Commission has a budgetary ceiling of $4.6 million for implementation of the TRADE solution, not including the price of operations and maintenance during the contract option years. 

The Commission wishes to obtain the following information from potential sources: (1) whether or not your firm would be interested in submitting a proposal in response to the final RFP; (2) whether or not there is adequate information provided in the draft RFP for a fixed price TRADE solution and, if not, what specific additional information would be needed; (3) whether or not you believe TRADE can be completed within the budgetary ceiling for a firm fixed price; and (4) any other comments or suggestions you may wish to provide.  

The final RFP is expected to be released in late April, 2005.  

Please submit comments to the Contracting Officer at ngraham@cftc.gov by April 15, 2005. NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND NO PROPOSALS OR OTHER MATERIAL SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD OF A CONTRACT.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate with Market Strategies, Inc., 20255 Victor Parkway, Suite 400 Livonia, Michigan 48152, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302.1.  The purpose of this requirement is to assist the DHHS Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in conducting a follow-up survey of consumers aged 50 to 70 in states participating in the Department’s Long-Term Care Awareness Campaign. A Contractor must have the ability to continue the processing of the survey data, without duplication of effort, from the previous two baseline surveys conducted before the campaign ran, as well as the names and phone numbers of the most recent baseline survey conducted in November and December of 2004.  A critical requirement of this acquisition is that the contractor possesses considerable background in the baseline research conducted for the Awareness Campaign.  Market Strategies, Inc. Is the only firm the Government is aware of which has access to the proprietary list of previously sampled consumers in the target market, as well as having systems already in place to conduct the CATI survey and the ability to merge the data into a single analytic file that contains the most recent pre and the yet to be conducted post survey responses.  Contractors must have; 1) access to the list of consumers who were interviewed for the most recent baseline survey, 2) the data system capabilities for conducting the CATI survey and merging the two files, 3) acquire specialized knowledge of the initial baseline survey and its value in the analysis of the more recent baseline and follow-up surveys.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a capability statement with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirements as described above.  No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements should be submitted within 45 days of the publication of this synopsis to Mr. Kevin McGowan, via E-Mail at KMcGowan@psc.gov.  All submissions of capability statements must be submitted via electronic mail to the aforementioned address by no later than close of business (3:00pm EST), May 20, 2005.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to modify Contract Number M67854-05-D-2000 with Lockheed Martin Corporation, Maritime Systems & Sensors, Electronics Parkway, Syracuse, NY 13221-4840 to procure an additional AN/TPS-59 Three-Dimensional Long-Range Radar System.  The current contract is for the maintenance, sustainment, and modernization of the existing eleven AN/TPS-59 systems; however, the Marine Corps is anticipating supplemental funding for the procurement of a twelfth system in FY05.  The AN/TPS-59(V)3 Radar System is a lightweight, transportable, long-range, solid state, 3-D L-Band radar.  The radar can be integrated as an automatic surveillance radar with either the AN/TYQ-23(V)1, or the AN/TYQ-23(V)4, as the principal sensor of the TAOC.  It may also be configured to operate with the Air Defense Communications Platform (ADCP) to provide TBM cueing to TADIL-J capable weapons systems.  The AN/TPS-59(V)3 Radar System, was developed and built by Lockheed Martin and fielded in 1998.  It is the only tactical system capable of detecting, tracking, and providing weapons cueing information on short, medium, and long range Tactical Ballistic Missiles (TBMs).  Lockheed Martin is considered the only source capable of meeting this requirement.  No RFP is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement.  No telephonic requests will be accepted.  All communications shall be in writing to the Contracting Officer and will only be used to consider whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Proprietary information shall be clearly identified as such and will be protected.  See Numbered Note 22.

Project Title	    Scientific Computing Data Mining Support

Department 	    Clinical Research Information Systems
		    Clinical Center
		    National Institutes of Health
                                       
Performance Period     April 18, 2005 – April 18, 2006 (approximately)

Summary
The Scientific Computing Section (SCS) is a component of the NIH Clinical Center that reports directly to the Clinical Center’s Chief Information Officer and Associate Director for Clinical Research Information Systems.  The purpose of SCS is to promote the application of advanced computer science methods to the biomedical sciences.  Data mining – the exploration of data with intelligent computing tools to find new knowledge - is an important activity in the SCS.  This Statement of Work calls for contractor support in the SCS’s data mining pursuits.

Background
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's foremost federally funded biomedical research institution. It has both intramural and extramural components.  The intramural component consists of twenty-four Institutes, and Centers, including the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.  This Clinical Center is now composed of two physically adjoining Clinical Centers that are clinical research hospitals providing medical services for inpatients and outpatients participating in human research protocols conducted by the intramural program of the NIH.  The Clinical Centers provide patient facilities as well as the general services necessary for clinical investigations by the NIH Institutes.  They also conduct research in related areas of clinical medicine and supervise residency and other training programs.

The oldest of the two Clinical Centers is the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center.     This hospital facility is comprised of three million square feet of clinical, laboratory, and administrative space with the capacity to serve three hundred and fifty inpatients participating in research studies at the NIH.   Increasing demands for space, both for research and expanded services, coupled with the facility's advancing age, spurred development and construction of a new clinical research center, the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (CRC), which opened in late 2004. The new CRC includes modern research facilities and a 220-bed hospital, outpatient care capability.

As part of the infrastructure for patient care the Clinical Center upgraded its 30 year Medical Information System (MIS) to a best-of-breed Clinical Research Information System (CRIS) which went live in August, 2004.  The CRIS project represents a comprehensive effort to modernize the systems that supports clinical care and the collection of research data for the intramural clinical research programs of the NIH.

The CRIS project has been under the direction of the Department of Clinical Research Informatics (DCRI) within the NIH Clinical Center.  DCRI has been responsible for processes and systems that directly affect users in the health care delivery and research settings. Work in DCRI has focused on the analysis and evaluation of clinical research computational needs and requirements, the development of design options that support the work processes of clinical research, and the implementation and management of responsive computer science methodology solutions.

The Scientific Computing Section (SCS) reports directly to the Clinical Center’s Chief Information Officer who is also the Associate Director of Clinical Research Information Systems.  The SCS supports and promotes organizational goals by seeking and engaging in active collaborative work with CRIS clinical research protocol users as well as with other biomedical researchers within the NIH Intramural Program and with members of academia and industry.  In this work, knowledge in both the biomedical sciences and the computing sciences is advanced, and practical results that lead to better health care are realized.  Data mining – the exploration of data with intelligent computing tools to find new knowledge - is an important activity in the SCS.  The work described in this Statement of Work will be guided and performed under the auspices of the SCS 

Purpose of The Contract
The purpose of this Contract is to engage the services of a Contractor to support specific data mining activities in the DCRI Scientific Computing Section through the performance of the tasks listed and described below.  These tasks are divided into four major categories, namely Hardware, Software, Administrative and Collaboration.

Contract Tasks   
This Contract calls for contractor support for certain data mining activities in the DCRI Scientific Computing Section (SCS).  The notion “data mining” as used here is intended to convey the idea of using existing data to discover new biomedical knowledge, or to suggest new hypotheses worthy of exploring.  This is in contrast (but complementary to) the more traditional hypothesis driven model more typical in biomedical research. “Multidisciplinary research team,” another notion used here, suggests that a team approach to data mining is emphasized. Such teams would be comprised of biomedical research scientists, computer scientists, statisticians, technical writers, etc.  In short, whatever skills needed to achieve rapid, high-quality results from data mining efforts would be brought together under this multidisciplinary team concept. Administrative and technical experience gained within the NIH Biomedical Computing Interest Group (BCIG) Biomedical Data Mining Multidisciplinary Research Team (BDMMRT) will be drawn upon and utilized in pursuing this data mining work. 

There are four major task groups to be accomplished under this Statement of Work.  These task groups are referred to as H=HARDWARE, S=SOFTWARE, A=ADMINISTRATIVE, and C=COLLABORATION.  All four-task groups span over the entire Statement of Work period (approximately one year) and the subtasks specified under each task group are to be worked on asynchronously, i.e. in a time-parallel multi-tasking fashion.  Each of these four major task groups subsumes four subtask classes, which are to be performed in each of four periods where each period runs over an approximate 90 days (quarter year) time span. Thus, the total number of tasks over the entire Contract is sixteen, and the entire Contract will run approximately one year. An overview of the tasks and the timeline is shown in Figure 1.  The sub-tasks are defined in a general manner below.  It is to be understood that more detailed definitions of these subtasks can only evolve and be made more explicit as data mining efforts progress. It is also to be understood that the Contractor will work closely with the Contract Officer to develop more detailed descriptions of the sub-tasks based on the experience and the knowledge gained as work progresses.

The four major task groups and their associated sub-tasks are as follows: 

HARDWARE  (H)

CRIS Data Warehouse:  The Clinical Research Information System (CRIS) has been operational in the NIH Clinical Center since August 2004. The CRIS system is a transactional repository system, meaning that it stores data in perpetuity, but it is designed for by-patient access of clinical information. Discussion is underway within DCRI to design and develop a CRIS Data Warehouse System that should provide the capability to query across patients with performance optimized for such queries and no issues of compromising clinical system performance.  The CRIS Data Warehouse hardware task group referred to here calls for the Contractor to consult with other DCRI representatives who are directly responsible for developing and implementing the CRIS Data Warehouse.  It will be the Contractor’s responsibility to clearly communicate the CRIS data acquisition needs of the clinical protocol researchers engaged in data mining collaborations with the SCS.

DLM Data Warehouse:  The NIH Clinical Center Department of Laboratory Medicine (DLM) uses a server developed in 2004 to capture, preserve, and run quality control and error reduction software on data emanating from laboratory instruments in the DLM environment.  This server serendipitously also serves as a data warehouse.  This DLM Data Warehouse hardware task group calls for on-going maintenance and use of this server as a data warehouse for extracting data used in clinical data mining projects including on-going laboratory instrument quality control and laboratory error reduction projects as well as data visualization projects conducted collaboratively among members of DLM and SCS.

Auxiliary Servers:  This hardware task group refers to building, maintaining, and using hardware servers other than the CRIS and DLM data warehouses just described.  The primary functions of these other servers are web hosting, data sharing, software sharing and multidisciplinary collaborative research.  

Web Site Development and Maintenance:  This hardware task group calls for support in developing and maintaining a web site for the SCS and assistance in the maintenance of the NIH Biomedical Computing Interest Group (BCIG) web site.

SOFTWARE (S)
Software Search, Identification and Evaluation:  This software task group calls for continuous monitoring of available software appropriate for use in the SCS.  All resources are to be considered including industry, and open source.. Assessing the potential utility of discovered software to fulfill the objectives of the SCS is also called for here. Specific recommendations for in-house software development when called for are also expected within this task group.

Software Acquisition and Implementation:  This software task group calls for support in the acquisition and implementation of appropriate software that will be used in SCS hosted data mining projects.

Data Acquisition and Preparation:  This software task group calls for acquiring and preparing data for data mining purposes.  Data will be acquired from multiple sources such as the servers mentioned under “Hardware” above as well as other servers, databases and from spreadsheet files provided by SCS collaborators. 

Software Design and Development:  This software task group calls for support in the design, development and implementation of system and application software.  It is expected that the Contractor will work closely with the Contract Officer and perhaps others in extreme programming fashion to produce this software.

ADMINISTRATIVE (A)
Strategic Planning: This administrative task group requires the Contractor to assist in the overall administrative, strategic, and operational plans for the SCS.

Communication: This administrative task group calls for advertising the SCS to potential collaborators by planning and announcing services and user focus group sessions arranged according to common computational needs. 

Documentation: This administrative task group calls for documenting all significant data mining work performed under this Contract. 

Publication: This administrative task group calls for Contractor participation in the preparation of scientific and technical papers relating to both the computer science and biomedical science aspects of work accomplished under this Contract.
 
COLLABORATION (C) 
Collaborator Recruitment: This collaboration task group calls for the Contractor to actively engage in recruiting collaborators to participate in the SCS data mining collaborations.

Domain Understanding: This collaboration task group calls for the contractor to study and understand the nature of  the SCS collaborators’ research.

Data Understanding: This collaboration task group requires the Contractor to understand in detail the scientific nature and meaning of the SCS collaborators’ data.

Training: This collaboration task group calls for demonstrating and training biomedical researchers using the computational data mining tools promoted by the SCS.

<DESC>Synopsis:

The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking proposals from business entities interested in participating in an acquisition as a Prime Vendor to provide items under the general grouping of metals and metal products and ancillary services for the Northeast, Central, and West Regions of the United States. A Prime Vendor, or integrated supplier, can be defined as the designation of a single source of supply for a wide range of products. The requirements covered under this solicitation include, but are not limited to, aluminum, stainless steel, carbon steel, copper, brass, titanium, nickel, alloys, and other industrial metals, in several forms, including wire, plate, sheet, strip, bar, angle, extrusion, pipe, tube, valves, fittings, and any other shape required by the ordering activities. The items required under this solicitation are not fixed to a discrete group of NSNs. Rather, requirements may change and expand or contract due to the needs of our customers. Related services such as cutting to size, scrap and salvage metal removal, and technical support will be included in any resultant contract as needed by ordering activities. 
The Northeast Region consists of the following states: Connecticut, Ohio, Delaware, The District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and West Virginia.
The Central Region consists of the following states: Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.
The West Region consists of the following states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, and Washington.   
Prospective contractors should have an on-line Electronic Order Entry (EOE) system and must have Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) capability. Subject solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis with the resultant contract being an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) for two base years with three (3) one-year term options. This will be a best value source selection acquisition in which technical merit is initially considered more important than price. Solicitation SP0500-03-R-0113 is expected to be issued by January 6, 2004 with an estimated closing date of February 20, 2004. To obtain further information or other details, contact Michael Tarkett at (215)737-4081 or Gerry Corcoran at (215)737-4248.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

In this first phase, interested companies will be required to submit an unpriced written technical proposal, which will be orally presented to the Government.  Upon conclusion of all oral presentations , all respondents with the greatest likelihood of success under a contract shall be invited to present a priced sealed bid.  In accordance with FAR 14.503-1 the Government will award a contract based on competitively priced bids for the services included i n the technical proposal.  For the purpose of awarding multiple contracts, including  two possible contracts to small businesses (one for each of the two groups identified for small business), the work scope is divided into four specific groups of service.   The categories of services are:  1.  Scientific and testing services; 2.  Other technical, which includes resource management and earned value management, logistics and information management; and 3.

The estimated date of release of the request for technical proposals is 30 days of this announcement. Performance of the contract requires a security clearance at the SECRET level.  All services shall be performed within Government spaces at Falls Church, VA; Frederick, MD; or Edgewood, MD.  The provisions of FAR 9.5, Organizational and Consultant Conflict s of Interest shall apply to this acquisition.  All participants must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration database to be eligible to receive a  contract award.  Foreign sources are excluded.

<DESC>Description:  This announcement is for the purpose of soliciting names of construction firms or joint ventures experienced in working in the Southwestern Asia/Middle East region who are interested in submitting an offer for this project.  To be a con sidered construction firm, the firm must perform road construction as a portion of its business.  Construction surety will be required.  The estimated cost of construction is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. PROJECT SCOPE:  The project consists of the design and construction of approximately 96 kilometers (59.7 miles) two lane bituminous asphalt road and five culvert crossings.  The work shall include preparation of a complete and coordinated set of design for  construction drawings with required supporting documents and calculations, and construction of fully functional road.  The road starts at the Main Supply Route (MSR) Tampa in Iraq and ends at the Khabari Police Station in the Kuwait-Iraq border.  Approxim ately 42 kilometers of existing roadbed will be rehabilitated and widened as conditions dictate.  The remaining kilometers is considered new road construction.  Site conditions may show that the existing base material may be suitable for use in some locati ons.  Drainage issues are unknown because of the unavailability of topographic information. CONTRACT PROCEDURES:  Both a price proposal and a technical proposal will be required.  The evaluation criteria will consist of pricing and non-pricing (technical) considerations.  Pricing consideration will be significantly more important that technical c onsiderations in the selection process. Price will be evaluated on the basis of the completeness and reasonableness of the prices proposed.  Completeness of proposed prices will be evaluated by the Government based upon a comparison of the process proposed as compared against the requirements of  the solicitation, scope of work and those costs included in the Governments Independent Government Estimate (IGE).  The reasonableness of prices proposed will be evaluated on the basis of a comparison of those prices with the prices proposed by the offer ors and as contained with the Governments Independent Government Estimate (IGE). Non-pricing factors include offerors Past Performance, Experience, and Management and Technical Capabilities.  Experience will consist of at least four subfactors:  Management and Staff Organization, Subcontracting, Security Considerations, and Execution Plan.  All three non-pricing factors will have approximately equal weight with one another in the evaluation and selection processes.  All subfactors within the same factor will have approximately equal weight with one another in the evaluation and selecti on processes. Evaluation factors will include, at a minimum, price, past performance, management capability, and experience.  Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued to prime contractors responding to this notice.  Tentative date of issuance of RFP is 26 April 2005. Tentative date for receipt of proposals is 09 June 2005.  Tentative contract award date is 28 July 2005.  Contract award will be made on a firm fixed-price basis.

<DESC>Air Mobility Command (AMC), is hosting AMC Industry Day 2005 at Scott AFB, IL 1-3 June 2005.  The objective of this event is to provide a forum for industry and research conduits to present maturing technologies that can be rapidly fielded.  Our focus will be on available technology solutions to support warfighter’s operational capabilities.  The sight picture highlights
technologies ready for transition to the field within the next eight years to support the following topic areas:

·	FORCE PROTECTION 
o	Aircraft Survivability 
o	Air Refueling 
o	Precision Airdrop 
o	Autonomous All-Weather Landing

·	BASE OPENING
o	Force Protection
o	Operations Support in Austere Environments

·	INFORMATION SUPERIORITY
o	Fused Information Technology

Briefing sessions are the primary medium for this forum.  Each day will have 8 briefing sessions (4 in the morning and 4 in the afternoon).  The nominal breakdown for each of the sessions is:

Brief - 40 minutes
Q&A - 10 minutes
Break - 10 minutes.  

We will hold the briefings in the Global Reach Planning Center,  on Scott AFB.  Audience attendance is limited to military, civilian government officials, and government contracted subject matter experts with signed non-disclosure statements so briefings can be open to "Proprietary Only" discussions.  Using the briefing session scheme described above, there are 48 time slots with the potential for up to 72.  This number depends on the response to this call for briefings.  In addition to the briefing sessions, Scott Club will exhibit/display tables and an ice-breaker for one-on-one interaction.
  On Thursday 2 June 2005, the Scott Club will be available for table-top displays and exhibits for interested staff officers and leadership to stop by when available.  The goal is to provide an opportunity for AMC staff to interact with Industry and Lab representatives on a one-on-one basis.  Also, after the 2 June briefing sessions, we will host an Ice-breaker in this open forum at the Scott Club to further provide opportunity for interaction.  Due to limited space and power availability, we only have room for 20 exhibits tables and limited poster board presentations.
  If you intend to brief/exhibit/demonstrate a technology, we request exhibit requirements (to include space and power) and a two-page executive summary/abstract to us No-later-than 4:00 p.m on Thursday,14 Apr 05.  Due to the limited time slots available, a selection process will be applied, if response dictates, based on applicable topic areas.  The announcement of presentation schedule/agenda will be provided NLT 3 May 05.  Final presentations for those selected are required to us by 22 May 05.
  
Anyone wishing to present/participate in the conference must submit a registration form to the email address below no later than 15 May 05.  Each presenter/exhibitor/attendee will be required to pay a conference fee.  The conference fee includes:  conference charges, coffee and light refreshments, and the Ice-breaker.  Exhibit/display setup will take place from 0730-0900hrs on 2 Jun 05.  Tear-down of exhibits is required after the Ice-breaker that evening.  The use of cameras or audio/visual recorders is strictly prohibited throughout the conference except during the Ice-breaker.  Export and import licenses, taxes, and/or shipping for any exhibit are the responsibility of the delegate providing it.

The purpose of this modification is to incorporate following information:

1.	At Section L.10, the language here was deleted in its’ entirety, because it was inadvertently included in the RFP;
2.	The discussion at Section L.10.(4)(v)(A) refers to the past success the offeror has had with regard to integrating the employment of small businesses into their normal business operations, or documented initiatives for achieving the previously noted objective.  At Section M.4.1.4.5, “Effectiveness of Key Personnel”, resides the criterion that will include a rating of the extent to which the offeror’s Key Personnel  have employed strategies to achieve successes in the area of small business employment, as well as, other characteristics that identify the staff as being uniquely effective in the conduct of their work performance;
3.	This is to confirm that although current USAID personnel may be included in proposals as proposed personnel, they are subject to criminal and regulatory restrictions that may restrict or prohibit their employment, and which prohibit them from participating in the development of a proposal or providing non-public information for use in a proposal.  These rules including 18 U.S.C. Sections 207-208, and 5 C.F.R. part 2635.

MARKET SURVEY
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The Container IPT, Agile Combat Support Systems Squadron (ACSSS), Air Armament Center, Eglin AFB FL, is requesting information from potential sources capable of updating and improving or redesigning the Government’s Container Design Retrieval System (CDRS).  CDRS is a database of long life, reusable containers established to prevent the proliferation and duplication of munitions containers within DOD.  CDRS provides tri-service users (which include the Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, Marines, Defense Logistics Agency and contractors) with a means of submitting a request via phone, fax, email ( cdrs@eglin.af.mil ) or through the CDRS websites, https://peonet.eglin.af.mil/containers/site.htm  or https://wmnet.eglin.af.mil/containers/site.htm to the Container IPT to search its database for possible existing or proven containers or container designs.  The current CDRS was written in 1991 in Microsoft ACCESS and contains approximately 6000 containers.  The data provided by the tri-service users to the Container IPT and captured in the database include: Requestor Information: Project Lead (Full Name), Street Address, City/Base, State/Province, Zip/Postal Code, Telephone (area code and DSN), Fax (area code and DSN), E-mail, DOD/Government Activity (Office Symbol), Contractor, Contract Number, Government POC, POC Information: POC Address, POC City/Base, POC State/Province, POC Zip/Postal Code, POC Telephone (are code and DSN), POC Fax (area code and DSN), POC E-mail, Item Description: Nomenclature, NSN/Part Number, Dimensions: Length, Width, Height, Diameter, Weight (lbs), Fragility of Item (linked to Fragility Factors), Item DOD Hazard Class, Drawing Available (Yes/No radial buttons), Special Handling Requirements or Constraints, Container Requirements: Quantity, Date Required, Number Items Per Container, Container Composition, Shock Migration System, Opening Style, Other Required Features.  Features/improvements to CDRS desired include: auto back-up, incorporation of standard fail-safe software devices to prevent inadvertent loss and corruption of information, enforcement of referential integrity, automatic entry date tag to identify date CDRS request submitted, feature to prevent unused spaces and blank records from being saved to the database, check all objects for dead ends and errors, indicator on each form to show user the number of records returned from a filter, improved ease of adding new records (autonumber or macro for creating sequential and unique key field values, check default values, and improve error handling for invalid new records), simple switchboard tied to an autoexec macro, improve look of reports (headers, footers, fonts, etc), consider a form for all reports with command buttons and report descriptions, addition of “Email This Record” functions, investigate how to automatically import missing FEDLOG records, and create the following automated reports:  compact and expanded view of assets and requests, Email ready responses to container requests, Cost savings statistics, Database activity metrics, Customer feedback reports.

ABSTRACT:

The Airbase Technology Division of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Tyndall AFB FL is interested in receiving research proposals in the areas of advanced technologies that develop chemical reactor systems.  These reactor systems are intended to (1) produce, or deliver, weapon system specific chemicals in combat quantities, under deployed force conditions, (2) convert waste chemicals and materials from combat weapon system maintenance and sustainment operations to benign compounds, or (3) efficiently produce thermal, mechanical or electrical energy on demand using new high-energy chemistry and reactor systems.  In addition, reactor systems are desired that (1) utilize compact unit operations (2) are compatible with force deployment constraints, (3) recover waste energy for redistribution, and/or (4) recover water for reuse.  Systems developed under this effort must be capable of being easily integrated with existing deployed base utility systems and concepts while anticipating the requirements of the AF Expeditionary Aerospace Force doctrine for the future.

Proposals should describe scientific study, experimentation, and process engineering to increase knowledge and understanding in these areas.

This Broad Agency Announcement consists of three parts:
PART I - Research Interests
PART II - Proposal Preparation
PART III - Proposal Evaluation
The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Companies responding to this announcement are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the Government to any agreement involving expenditure of Government funds.

This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) constitutes a solicitation for proposals under the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  The BAA describes research requirements and methods for preparing and submitting proposals. 

PART I
RESEARCH INTERESTS

A.  INTRODUCTION
This is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Airbase Technology Division (AFRL/MLQ) under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984   For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study, experimentation, and process engineering directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs.  It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs.

AFRL/MLQ contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in Deployed Base Infrastructure, and Force Protection.  This BAA is intended to cover technology associated with the sustainment and logistics support of advanced weapons.  Persons contemplating submission of a proposal to AFRL/MLQ should not only carefully examine this BAA, but are also strongly encouraged to contact the AFRL/MLQ technical person identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest which AFRL/MLQ may have in a specific research project.

Prior to submitting a formal proposal, offerors are to submit white paper on their proposed research topic not to exceed three (3) pages in length.  Submit white papers to the following address: Air Force Research Laboratory Contracting Division, AFRL/MNK, Attn. Ms Kim Jones, 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA.  Those offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA will be invited to submit a proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent contract or assistance instruments (grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction).  Proposals submitted may be evaluated as they are received.  Invited proposals may be submitted at any time during the period the BAA is open.

A contract or assistance instrument could be awarded as a result of this BAA, as appropriate.  We expect most awards with universities and non-profit organizations to be grants.  Note that there is no inherent funding associated with this BAA, and any contract/assistance instrument will depend on availability of funds from other sources.  While no parts of this requirement lend themselves to being severed for set-aside to Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs), or Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI), the Air Force reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based on responses hereto.  The division goal is to award thirty percent (30%) of the contracts to Small Businesses, ten percent (10%) of the contracts to Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), ten percent (10%) of the contracts to Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions, over the life of this BAA.  For the purpose of this BAA, the size standard is 500 employees (NAICS 541710).  In the event sufficient acceptable proposals are not received to fulfill these goals, awards will be made to those proposals received, which are acceptable regardless of source.

B.  MISSION

The mission of the Airbase Technology Division is to conduct research and engineering development that results in the demonstration of high-risk, high-payoff technology needed to meet the current and future requirements. Long-term technology development is needed to produce lighter, more rapid bare-base deployment; a more secure and protected force structure; and rapid, effective deployment of advanced Air Force weapon systems.  Technological advances in these key areas will ensure sustained global superiority of the Air Force for the foreseeable future through improved Air Force and Joint Operations readiness, rapid exploitation and utilization of the space mission, the successful deployment of advanced, complex weapons, and more effective peace-time training.

PART III
PROPOSAL EVALUATION

A.	Proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be evaluated as received using the factors given below.  The factors are listed in descending order of importance.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals.
1.  The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, the potential contributions of the effort to the AFRL/MLQ mission and the extent to which the research effort will contribute to balancing this Division’s overall research program.
2.  The offeror’s capabilities, related experience (to include past and present performance), facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these, which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.
3.  The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives.
4.  The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror if any, and the availability of funds.
B.	Upon receipt of a proposal, the AFRL/MLQ technical staff will perform an initial review of its scientific merit and potential contribution to the Air Force mission and also determine if funds are expected to be available for the effort. Proposals not considered having sufficient scientific merit or relevance to Air Force needs, or those in areas for which funds are not expected to be available, may be declined without further review.
C.	It is the policy of AFRL/MLQ to treat all proposals as privileged information prior to award, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  Proposals not declined as a result of initial review will be subject to an extensive evaluation within the Government.  The offeror must indicate on the appropriate form any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the proposal.
D.	Each proposal will be evaluated based on the merit and relevance of the specific research proposed as it relates to the overall AFRL/MLQ program, rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area.

<RESPDATE>041205
<ARCHDATE>04052006
<CONTACT>Wendy E. Stone, Contract Specialist, Phone (281) 244-6459, Fax (281) 244-5337, Email wendy.e.stone@nasa.gov - Keith D. Hutto, Contracting Officer, Phone (281) 483-4165, Fax (281) 244-5337, Email keith.d.hutto@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/JSC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for a miniature cold-gas thruster valve, for use on the Mini-AERCam Engineering Development Unit (EU).  The EU is the flight prototype for a free-flying robotic camera platform, conceived as a second-generation version of the SPRINT vehicle that was flown on STS87 in 1997.  Mini-AERCam is a highly integrated/miniaturized vehicle, combining three cameras, GPS, propulsion, power, avionics, communications, video compression and illumination subsystems inside an 8-inch sphere.  These valve specifications are intended to provide enough detail to give prospective suppliers a starting point for design, or for comparison to existing hardware.  These thruster valves provide proof of the prospective vendor’s capability to design and deliver hardware that is suitable for subsequent qualification for flight.  Some adjustments may be made, depending on cost, schedule, and performance attributes.  The desired delivery date for 15 ground-test-only units is 4 months from contract approval, approximately late August 2005.	Prospective suppliers are encouraged to make suggestions for modifying this proposed SOW, to streamline delivery and reduce costs where appropriate. Valve Specifications: The minimum flow shall be equivalent to a square edged orifice, diameter of 0.034 inches and Cd of 0.65.  Materials shall be compatible with gaseous Nitrogen and Xenon.  Minimum stall pressure shall be 200 psig at 160 deg F and 20 Vdc.  Drop-out voltage shall be less than &lt; 4.5 Vdc at 100 psig.  The valve shall operate from 19 to 30 volts DC for pull-in and be compatible with pulse-width modulation for hold-in with a 50% duty cycle at 1khz.	A maximum voltage of 35 volts shall not damage the valve.  The minimum coil resistance shall be 28 ohms.  Opening and closing response shall each be less than 3.0 ms at 100 psig inlet.  Internal and external leakage shall each not exceed 0.1 sccm at 100 psig.  The valve shall be capable of completing a minimum of 20,000 cycles.  Minimum proof pressure shall be 300 psig and minimum burst pressure shall be 600 psig.  Wiring shall conform to MIL-W-22759 specification, 28 or 30 gauge, with shielding per MIL-C-27500.  The valve shall perform nominally after exposure to the following vibration environment (unpressurized): GRMS 6.1 (20 - 80 HZ at +3 db/octave 80 - 350 Hz at .067 g2/hz constant 350 - 2000 Hz at -3 db/octave).  The duration is 5 minutes per 3 axes.  Demonstration can be by test, analysis, or assessment.  Fluid connection shall be cartridge-style; using O-rings per figure 1 and envelope shall not exceed Figure 1.  The valve shall be capable of operating in an environment from 0 deg F to 160 deg F.  The minimum cleanliness shall be per MIL-STD-1246 Level 200 or equivalent.  The valve shall have inlet filtration to protect against system assembly induced contamination.	Acceptance data shall be provided; data sheet format is acceptable.  NASA shall approve all drawings, materials, deviations, test procedures and test stand schematic prior to testing. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).  Technical questions should be directed to: Joseph Studak (281) 483-9029 or joseph.w.studak@nasa.gov. Procurement related questions should be directed to: Wendy Stone (281) 244-6459 or wendy.e.stone@nasa.gov. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to Joseph Studak no later than April 12, 2005.  Please reference NNJ05MCGTV in any response.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

RFI eAuthentication Path Discovery and Validation 

..INTRODUCTION: The E-Authentication Initiative (EAI) has identified the need for products and services to perform certificate path discovery and validation in compliance with Federal government requirements.  The intent of this Request for Information (RFI) is to invite the vendor community to share their capabilities in this area with the Federal government.  

The Federal Public Key Infrastructure (FPKI) is constructed as a bridge-enabled environment.  The EAI acknowledges that commercially available products capable of performing path discovery and path validation in a bridge-enabled environment may be very limited.  Thus, the intent of this RFI is to query the vendor community to determine the state of available products and their ability to implement any or all of the functional requirements described in Section 4 of this document.

..SCOPE: The RFI document specifies the functional requirements for certificate path discovery and validation used in cross-domain environment.  Section 2 of the document describes the EAI’s general approach to identify appropriate products and services.  Section 3 provides background information on the cross-domain environment in which these products and services will operate.  Functional requirements are specified for path discovery, path validation, delegated path validation, auditing, and hosted services in Section 4.  Three basic scenarios for implementing these requirements are considered: all functionality may be performed locally; all functionality may be performed remotely by a hosted service; or, functionality may be shared between a local capability and a remote hosted service.  Auditing may be handled by the same component that performs path discovery and validation, or may be left to each PKI-enabled application.  Related expectations for performance metrics are specified in Section 5.

..GENERAL APPROACH: Section 4 of the RFI document describes the functional requirements for performing certificate validation for certificate-based applications utilizing the FPKI.  While the Government's ultimate goal is to acquire products/services that fully meet these requirements, we acknowledge that products/services available today may not fully address these requirements.  Therefore, we are interested in determining the state of industry, and subsequently working with vendors whose products most closely meet these requirements.
The Government is seeking information on two general approaches for certification validation: local validation products and hosted validation services.  Local validation products are co-located with the relying application.  Hosted validation services are services provided by the vendor that perform the certificate validation, and interface to the relying application to provide certificate validation results.  Applications may include web-based applications running on web servers (e.g., Apache, Microsoft IIS, etc.), and desktop applications (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, Adobe Acrobat, etc.). Vendors are asked to review the set of functional requirements described within the RFI Section 4.  Vendors are then asked to provide a response for each capability, indicating whether or not their respective product/service implements this capability.  Appendix A of the RFI provides the template to be used for all responses.  Multiple templates should be used for multiple product responses.
Responses will be reviewed, and products and services best meeting the needs of the EAI will be invited for testing in the E-Authentication Interoperability Lab.  Testing will begin April 25, 2005.  At the conclusion of this testing, products and services determined to be acceptable may be entered onto a list of qualified and preferred vendors for use by federal agencies implementing certificate-based E-Authentication solutions.  This list will be released to the public no later than June 30, 2005.

..HOW TO OBTAIN A COPY OF THE RFI:  If your firm is interested in participating in this ambitious project, then submit your request for a copy of the RFI eAuthentication Path Discovery and Validation Products and Services document to pathval2@cam.mitretek.org.

<DESC>The Utility Helicopters Project Office (UHPO) is seeking information from sources that feel they are capable of providing Cable Warning and Obstacle Avoidance (CW/OA) for the UH-60 helicopter.  The U.S. Army H-60 Blackhawk helicopters are routinely o perated at altitudes below 500 feet above ground level (AGL) in limited visibility (less than 1 NM ) conditions.  Fog, rain, snow, dust, or battlefield obscurants may limit visibility.  The ideal CW/OA system would provide the capability to detect cables/w ires/poles under limited visibility while in low altitude cruise as well as the capability to provide enhanced see-through capability during landings in heavy snow (white out) or dust (brownout) conditions.  The following attributes are desired in a CW/OA product for use on a UH-60 helicopter. * Capabilities: Threshold:  Be able to detect cables, guy-wires, and poles for CW/OA. Objective:  Provide CW/OA and enhance horizon and obstacle imaging during brownout/whiteout takeoffs and landings. * Operating Environment: Threshold & Objective: Day, Night, Fog, Rain, Snow, Dust, Battlefield Obscurants over land and water. * Hazard Detection:  Threshold/Objective:  Be able to detect standard-sized U.S. electrical power wires at distances that will allow pilot to react.  * False Alarm Rate: Threshold/Objective:  Greater than 99% detection capability with no more than 1 false alarm per flight hour. * Cockpit Display / Cueing: Threshold: Provide range and bearing information for aircraft without data bus and MFD.   Objective: Provide range and bearing information and real-time visual display of obstacles / horizon. * Cockpit Integration: Threshold: Mount as a stand-alone system on aircraft not equipped with data-bus or display capability. NVG compatible. Objective: Capable of both stand-alone installation on the UH-60 A/L and integration with data-bus integration and control on the UH-60M. * Detection of System:   Threshold/Objective: LPI/LPD (Low probability of intercept/detection). * Weight of Complete System: Threshold: 60 lb. Objective: 20 lb * External Sensor Dimensions: Threshold/Objective:  As small as possible. * Cooling Requirements: Threshold/Objective: Operate with ambient air.  No auxiliary air-conditioning or cooling fans required for ground and flight operations. * Technology Readiness Level:   Threshold:  TRL 5; Component or breadboard validation in a relevant environment.  Objective: TRL 7; System prototype demonstration in an operational environment. Provide as much of the following information as possible on products that can be used for cable warning/ obstacle avoidance on U.S. Army UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters:    Summary Paper:  Describe sensor technology, hazard detection range (include expected range performance in: clear weather, heavy fog, heavy rain, snow, dust), sensor dimensions, cockpit display method, system weight availability of functional prototype, availability of production hardware, previous & current rotary & fixed wing integration efforts, existing system certification (FAA, JAA, etc), length of time and cost to reach production, production unit cost.          System specifications:  Contractor format system specifications and certification compliance matrix.  Functional prototype test results.      Flight test reports: Reports substantiating system performance in light under clear weather, heavy fog, heavy rain, snow, dust.  The UHPMO intends to utilize the responses to this synopsis to formulate an acquisition strategy for the Blackhawk CW/OA system.  This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids or a Request for Proposal and is not a commitment by the U.S. Army to procure products or services.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or o therwise pay for the information solicited.

<DESC>This synopsis is to announce that Charleston Air Force Base (CAFB) is considering an initiative to offer access to commercial cable television service (CATV) providers to install cable on CAFB at no cost to the Government.  Please note that due to the adjacent dual-use commercial and military airfield, site installation will require an extensive approval process.  Currently Comcast is the owner of all CATV wiring and the Government intends to contract with their company for future service.  However, if any other commercial cable providers are interested in requesting permission to install cable on base without any contractual commitment from the government to purchase any service or equipment, they should respond to the 437th Contracting Squadron, TSgt Tamara Lee at (843) 963-5164.

<DESC>Request for Information  

“Interoperability problems in the capital facilities industry stem from the highly fragmented nature of the industry, the industry’s continued paper-based business practices, a lack of standardization, and inconsistent technology adoption among stakeholders.  Based on interviews and surveys it is found that $15.8 billion in annual interoperability costs were quantified for the capital facilities industry in 2002.  Of these costs, two-thirds are borne by owners and operators, which incur most of these costs during ongoing facility operation and maintenance (O&M).”  

The United States General Services Administration (GSA) / Public Buildings Service (PBS) is seeking information from industry partners on Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) -Based, Integrated and Interoperable Building Information Model (BIM) technology as part of its effort to improve project deliveries in the capital construction program.  The GSA/PBS currently has an active pipeline of more than 200 major capital construction projects conclusively exceeding a value of eleven (11) billion United States dollars. 

In December of 2003, the GSA/PBS issued internal guidance to its regional staff stressing the need to focus on on-time and under budget deliveries of projects in the capital construction program, with specific initiatives to improve each project's definition and execution processes.  New and emerging technologies such as 3D/4D and Building Information Models, according to this guidance, have the potential to dramatically improve the outcome of projects and enhance customer satisfaction.  

During 2004, several industry milestones have further supported the GSA/PBS’s resolve:

•	The publication of The Construction Users Roundtable (CURT) A/E Productivity Task Force Report which strongly encourages the use of virtual modeling as a keystone to improved A/E design delivery.  Information pertaining to CURT may be viewed at their website, http://www.curt.org/.  

•	The publication of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Study on the "Cost Analysis of Inadequate Interoperability in the U.S. Capital Facilities Industry." Information pertaining to this study may be viewed at the NIST website, http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/oae/publications/gcrs/04867.pdf. 

On-going engagement between the GSA/PBS and numerous industry partners and organizations on this issue include :  The American Institute of Architects (AIA), Construction Users Roundtable (CURT), Construction Specifications Institute (CSI), Construction Management Association of America (CMAA), Association of General Contractors (AGC), Civil Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Federal Facilities Council (FFC), Stanford Center for Integrated Facilities Engineering (CIFE), the Open Standards for Commercial Real Estate (OSCRE) , FIATECH, the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS), and the International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI). 

The General Services Administration/Public Buildings Service, National Capital Region, Washington, DC announces an opportunity for firms in the design, construction, facility management, and real property industries to submit information on the use of IFC-BIM Technology.  This information will be utilized to assist the government in establishing potential sources in the marketplace with knowledge and experience in the use and practices of this state-of-the-art technology.  This is not a solicitation or request for specific proposals.  
 
For each submission, provide at a minimum, the below listed information in the following format:

I:  	Name of Company or Organization, Contact Name, phone number and email address, Description of product or service, product literature or other information, and expressions of interest.
II:	Include examples of best practices, case studies, white papers, published articles, PowerPoint or multimedia presentations, and identify any software packages.
III:	Identify architecture, consulting, construction management and construction professional organizations, firms, and individuals that are currently involved in or with corporate and organizational strategies supporting and promoting this new paradigm.
IV:	Identify any improved business processes, integrated decision making practices, and collaborative design processes that have been established as a result of this technology.
V:	List all known BIM contracting specifications.
VI:	Any other beneficial information.

All information submitted must be in the public domain and not proprietary or otherwise business confidential.  The GSA/PBS may, at its sole discretion, request additional information from items submitted and review and publish the information as a body of knowledge on a publicly Accessible website. Submit all information by email or with word, PDF, PowerPoint, URLs, or other attachments no later than March 15, 2005 to: ifc.bim@gsa.gov. Any questions regarding this request for information may also be submitted to the same email address.

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

'Person', 'domestic', and 'foreign' have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTE: Offerors are advised that proposals sent by conventional US Mail service are not routed directly to the above address.  FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999).  Evaluation Factors:  Operational Effectiveness - Describe your ability to currently meet the performance requirements stated in this purchase description.  Ensure that your stated response addresses overall product compatibility, as well as any additional parameters not specifically cited in the purchase description.  Address any specific commercial or extended warranty provisions for the resulting product.  Past Performance - Provide specific examples of favorable recent past performance that illustrates evidence of your ability to produce, deliver, and warrant your product.  Ensure the past performance information includes names of technical and contracting officials, telephone numbers, addresses, e-mail, name of the product purchased, quantities, dates of the resulting contract, contract value, contract number and a description of the items procured.  Relative Order of Importance:   (i) Operational Effectiveness - Most important. (ii) Past Performance - Less important. Price - Evaluated, but not rated. Award shall be made to the offeror whose proposal presents the best value to the government.  In making its "Best Value" determination, the Government will consider overall technical and past performance merit to be of significantly greater importance than evaluated price.  However, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination will increase with the degree of equality in the overall merits of the proposals.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations.  FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.

Questions and answers from site visit

1)	Is there going to be place to store the excess furniture on base until asbestos abatement, wall painting, drop ceiling and lighting installation and carpet replacement is complete?
a.	We are attempting to secure room A-205 and will have room B-108 for storage.  If approved, this should be more than enough to temporarily store items in.  If not, there may not be anywhere else on base where the furniture can be stored.  

2)	Will there be government-supplied forklifts available if needed?
a.	Yes the government will have a forklift and driver available if needed, but everything should fit in the two rooms tentatively provided to store the furniture until completion of the rest of the work.

3)	Can we use mobile storage?
a.	If needed you may use mobile storage and park the storage in the large parking lot next to this building.  Advance notice will be required in order to obtain approval from the building owner to utilize the parking lot for this purpose.

4)	Will we have to remove and box up personal items?
a.	No, personal items will be removed before this process is started; this request includes any non-personal items as well as anything that will need to be disassembled.

5)	How long will the items be in storage before the items can be returned to where they were removed?
a.	4 to 5 weeks

6)	When will you need us to start on this?
a.	We are hoping to get started by April 25, 2005

7)	Is there an elevator in the building?
a.	No, but everything should fit in the tentative storage provided on the floor in which is currently located

8)	Will the two cabinets in room 114 need to be removed also?
a.	Yes and since they will not fit through the door they will have to be disassembled?

<DESC>AMENDMENT NO. 1.

The due date for the Request for Information has been extended from March 15, 2005 to June 15, 2005.  

END OF AMENDMENT NO. 1

Request for Information  

“Interoperability problems in the capital facilities industry stem from the highly fragmented nature of the industry, the industry’s continued paper-based business practices, a lack of standardization, and inconsistent technology adoption among stakeholders.  Based on interviews and surveys it is found that $15.8 billion in annual interoperability costs were quantified for the capital facilities industry in 2002.  Of these costs, two-thirds are borne by owners and operators, which incur most of these costs during ongoing facility operation and maintenance (O&M).”  

The United States General Services Administration (GSA) / Public Buildings Service (PBS) is seeking information from industry partners on Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) -Based, Integrated and Interoperable Building Information Model (BIM) technology as part of its effort to improve project deliveries in the capital construction program.  The GSA/PBS currently has an active pipeline of more than 200 major capital construction projects conclusively exceeding a value of eleven (11) billion United States dollars. 

In December of 2003, the GSA/PBS issued internal guidance to its regional staff stressing the need to focus on on-time and under budget deliveries of projects in the capital construction program, with specific initiatives to improve each project's definition and execution processes.  New and emerging technologies such as 3D/4D and Building Information Models, according to this guidance, have the potential to dramatically improve the outcome of projects and enhance customer satisfaction.  

During 2004, several industry milestones have further supported the GSA/PBS’s resolve:

•	The publication of The Construction Users Roundtable (CURT) A/E Productivity Task Force Report which strongly encourages the use of virtual modeling as a keystone to improved A/E design delivery.  Information pertaining to CURT may be viewed at their website, http://www.curt.org/.  

•	The publication of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Study on the "Cost Analysis of Inadequate Interoperability in the U.S. Capital Facilities Industry." Information pertaining to this study may be viewed at the NIST website, http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/oae/publications/gcrs/04867.pdf. 

On-going engagement between the GSA/PBS and numerous industry partners and organizations on this issue include :  The American Institute of Architects (AIA), Construction Users Roundtable (CURT), Construction Specifications Institute (CSI), Construction Management Association of America (CMAA), Association of General Contractors (AGC), Civil Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Federal Facilities Council (FFC), Stanford Center for Integrated Facilities Engineering (CIFE), the Open Standards for Commercial Real Estate (OSCRE) , FIATECH, the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS), and the International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI). 

The General Services Administration/Public Buildings Service, National Capital Region, Washington, DC announces an opportunity for firms in the design, construction, facility management, and real property industries to submit information on the use of IFC-BIM Technology.  This information will be utilized to assist the government in establishing potential sources in the marketplace with knowledge and experience in the use and practices of this state-of-the-art technology.  This is not a solicitation or request for specific proposals.  
 
For each submission, provide at a minimum, the below listed information in the following format:

I:  	Name of Company or Organization, Contact Name, phone number and email address, Description of product or service, product literature or other information, and expressions of interest.
II:	Include examples of best practices, case studies, white papers, published articles, PowerPoint or multimedia presentations, and identify any software packages.
III:	Identify architecture, consulting, construction management and construction professional organizations, firms, and individuals that are currently involved in or with corporate and organizational strategies supporting and promoting this new paradigm.
IV:	Identify any improved business processes, integrated decision making practices, and collaborative design processes that have been established as a result of this technology.
V:	List all known BIM contracting specifications.
VI:	Any other beneficial information.

All information submitted must be in the public domain and not proprietary or otherwise business confidential.  The GSA/PBS may, at its sole discretion, request additional information from items submitted and review and publish the information as a body of knowledge on a publicly Accessible website. Submit all information by email or with word, PDF, PowerPoint, URLs, or other attachments no later than March 15, 2005 to: ifc.bim@gsa.gov. Any questions regarding this request for information may also be submitted to the same email address.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26. This solicitation is a small business set-aside. The NAIC code is 332992 and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The U. S. Coast Guard (USCG) will award a firm-fixed-price, Indefinite Quantity, Indefinite Delivery type contract for the purchase of .40 caliber full metal jacket (ball) ammunition to support the USCG’s new service handgun (SIG SAUER P229R-DAK).  International convention identifies full metal jacket (ball) as the ammunition to be used by combatants who are party to the convention.  As such, USCG operations often involve deployment to hostile areas and are subject to said requirements.  Currently, the USCG does not have an established source of supply for .40 caliber full metal jacket (ball) ammunition either through the Department of Defense or other Federal Government agencies and as such, is seeking to put in place an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure the required ammunition.  The contractor shall provide the ammunition to the following standards:  Projectile caliber:  .40 caliber.  Projectile weight:  155 grains.  Projectile muzzle velocity:  1190 feet per second + 30 feet per second.  Projectile shape:  full metal jacket (ball).  Projectile construction:  lead core with a copper jacket.  Pressure:  The maximum pressure shall not exceed SAAMI specifications for the .40 S & W per ANSI/SAAMI Z299.3.  Cartridge:  The cartridge shall conform to the American National Standards Institute, Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute (ANSI/SAAMI) physical dimensions as defined in ANSI/SAAMI Z299.3 for .40 S & W ammunition.  Cartridge case construction: Cartridge casings shall be constructed of new, unfired brass.  Accuracy:  The desired Grouping shall have an average radius of no greater than 1.5 inches for five (5), five shot groups fired at a distance of 25 yards.  

The minimum quantity is 2,000,000 rounds over the life of the contract.  The maximum quantity is 2,000,000 rounds per year and 6,000,000 rounds for the total period of performance.  The period of performance shall be from date of award through 365 days thereafter, with two one-year option periods.  Prices for CLIN 0001 will be used for orders placed from contract award through 365 days (Base Period).  Prices for 1001 will be used for orders placed during Option Period 1 and prices for 2001 will be used for orders placed during Option Period 2.  The anticipated delivery schedule is 60 days after the initial award of the first Delivery Order for the first 200,000 rounds, with each increment of 200,000 rounds that are ordered to be delivered at a rate of 30 days thereafter for that Delivery Order and all subsequent orders.  No delivery should exceed 200,000 rounds at any given time, unless otherwise specified by the Contracting Officer.  Should Delivery Orders be placed prior to completion of a Delivery Order already in place, the first delivery date for that next Delivery Order shall be 30 days after the last shipment is shipped from the previous Delivery Order, such that there is not an overlap in deliveries from one Delivery Order to the next, unless otherwise specified by the Contracting Officer.  The technical point of contact is GMCS Tim Knight, (717) 605-8598.  The Contracting Officer is Ms. Jennie Peterson (202) 475-3215.

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ) for a firm-fixed price contract.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the most current Federal Acquisition Circular and DFARS Change Notice (DCN).  This acquisition is a small business business set-aside.  The standard industrial classification code is 4212.  The NAICS code is 562119 and the size standard is $10.5 million.  The acquisition is as follows:

The 452d Flight Test Squadron/Airborne Laser Program (452 FLTS/ABL), Edwards AFB CA, produces chemical compounds necessary for testing and development.  After testing, the mixed chemical batches are returned to the Integrated Mixing Facility (IMF), where they are placed into a bulk storage tank.  The mixture, mostly composed of inorganic caustics, deionized water, and other trace elements/compounds is pH adjusted with sulfuric acid and then transferred to a 20,000-gallon holding tank, where it is evaluated for on-base management and/or off-site disposal/recycling.  Each pH-adjusted batch is between 10,000 and 20,000 gallons, generated at an average of two batches (40,000 gallons) per month, with a specific gravity between 8.9 and 9.5 (lbs/gallon), and a pH between 6 and 9.  However, depending on test success and frequency, the total monthly volume could be between 40,000 and 100,000 gallons.  Analytical evaluations have proven the waste to be Non-Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Non-California state regulated (nonhazardous) wastewater contaminated with approximately 5 percent (%) hydroxide salts, less than (<) .05% total chloride, <0.1% other trace compounds such as hydrogen peroxide and iodine, and iron from the oxidation of the holding tanks.

The requested service is for removal, transportation, and disposal/recycling of nonhazardous wastewater in minimum incremental orders for 5,000 gallon tank trucks. The government agrees that due to the higher specific gravity of this wastewater, the transporter will be required to load less than 5,000 gallons per truck in order to meet the Department of Transportation weight restriction.  The maximum volume at which the weight limit can be legally met will be considered a “full load” during the performance under this contract.  The transport tank truck shall not be contaminated with any other residual wastestreams upon delivery.  The normal response time on the order will be between 48 and 72 hours.  The government agrees that if the Service Provider (SP) is required to provide less than a 24-hour response upon order, additional charges may be applied by the SP.  The government also agrees that if the removal is delayed due to on-site originated circumstances, additional charges may be applied by the SP.

Period of performance is 12 months after date of contract.  

Qualified service providers and their proposed subcontract transporters/facilities must not have pending regulatory corrective actions and/or pending Notice of Violation(s) relating to their current permit/operational conditions or affiliated activities.  The Edwards AFB Environmental Management Office (EMO) also has the right to evaluate past violations and/or corrective actions as part of the evaluation process.  Also, qualified service providers and their proposed subcontract transporters/facilities must either be currently on the DRMS (DLA) Qualified Facilities List and/or have been audited by the Edwards AFB EMO within the past 3 years.  NOTE:  The DRMS Qualified Facilities List can be accessed at www.drms.dla.mil (Environmental/Hazardous Waste).  The potential service provider must include the names and addresses of all proposed transporters and disposal/recycling facilities to be utilized, to allow the government to perform the necessary evaluations. 

The following provisions and clauses apply:  Provision 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference.  This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.  (End of Provision)   Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial; clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items; clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders--Commercial Items (to include:  52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers With Disabilities; 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans); clause 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Central Contractor Registration; and provision 52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items, the following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:  technically acceptable lowest priced offer.  Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision 52.212-3, Offeror’s Online Representations and Certifications Application--Commercial Items with the offer.

<DESC>MOD 0001 - This amendment is issued to incorporate to answer quoter questions as follows:

1) “Could you please give us an idea of the number of feet in the library and compact shelving that have to relocate.”     

Library:  We do not know how much of our present library will be moving with us at this time. If all of it were to move with us, then, presently, the library is in two different locations (because of the way we have had to re-claim space for offices.)  There are 4 walls of shelves, each 8 feet high, with the following lengths:  48 ft long, 20 ft long, 24 ft long and 10 ft long.   All shelves are 18 inches deep. 

Compact files: We do not know whether it would be cost effective to dismantle and reassemble the existing unit.  The unit is approx:  20 ft long, 12 ft deep and 7 ft. high. 
 
2) “Is there an inventory list of work stations and furniture for the project?”
 
There is presently not an inventory per se.  We do not know which of our present furniture pieces will be moving with us, as the new space has been designed for systems furniture, and we have traditional wood furniture. We are assuming that much of our furniture will be new.  

For discussion purposes, I can outline for you the following furniture pieces that are presently in our space:  Most staff, (135) whether line staff or managers, have a desk and/or credenza , task chair, guest chair, bookcase(s) and 1-3 vertical file cabinets.  Senior managers (8) have a table with 6 chairs in addition. Non-senior managers have 2-3 more guest chairs.  There are 3-4 areas with anywhere from 6-10 lateral file cabinets.  The District Administrator has a number of additional pieces, such as a couch and side tables and a couple more bookcases.  

II. Except as provided herein, all terms and conditions of the subject solicitation, remain unchanged.


This synopsis/solicitation is for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement requests quotations and constitutes the only solicitation; a separate solicitation will not be issued.

<DESC>This amendment number 02 to synopsis/solicitation W9124R-5068-0003 is issued to clarify answer to question 5 on amendment 01.  Due date for proposals remains 4:30 pm MST 11 April 2005. The following request to clarify Government response to question 5 was received: Regarding YPG responses to questions 4 & 5, I now understand that there is an existing roll up door at the upper 2nd floor level and we are to provide an electrical/mechanical interlock for this existing roll-up door.  We have these two follow-up question s/clarifications:   Q5A)  Is this existing roll-up door closed when the lift is not present or is it an emergency fire roll-up door that only closes in the event of a fire?    A5A)  The existing door provides access to the floor.  Material is currently moved to the floor by forklift through this door.  The door is closed when the lift is not present.  There is also an accordion style steel sliding door on the inside of the rol lup door.  This steel sliding door is secured except during material handling operations.    Q5B)  Do  we need to include a new interlocked double swing door at this level in addition to the fire roll-up door?     A5B)  A new double swing door for the upper floor will not be required if the existing door is interlocked to the VRC.  The interlocking devices or new door shall be provided with the VRC.
