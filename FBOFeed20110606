<DESC>U - Special Higher Education Program and Loan for Service Program
Solicitation Number: A11PS00449
Notice Type: 
Combined Synopsis/Solicitation 
Notice: 
 The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is soliciting services for the administration of the Special Higher Education Program (SHEP) and the Loan for Service Program (LFS). For decades, SHEP has provided congressionally mandated funding to provide in excess of one million dollars annually to cover both graduate level education and law degrees for American Indian and Alaskan Native students. 
 This follows services performed by the American Indian Graduate Center, Albuquerque, NM under BIA contract number CBK00060001. The solicitation will be issued as a request for proposals (RFP) under solicitation number A11PS00449. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611710 which has a size standard of $7M to qualify as a small business.
The contractor shall undertake efforts that include, but are not limited to: (1) administer the SHEP program; (2) administer the LFS program. The contractor shall propose an administrative fee (fixed rate percentage) to perform this work. 
The RFP containing the Statement of Work (SOW); along with applicable attachments are attached to this notice. It is BIA's intent to award one firm fixed price contract. This requirement will be solicited under full and open competition. The contract's period of performance shall be for a one year base period with four one-year option periods. It is anticipated that the solicitation release date will be on or after May 31, 2011, with a due date of June 24, 2011. The purpose of the FedBizOpps announcement is to notify potential offerors of this requirement. To streamline the procurement process, and to utilize the internet and electronic communications to the maximum extent possible, the RFP, any amendments, and other related items for this procurement will be posted at https://ideasec.nbc.gov/j2ee/login.jsp. Please continue to check this website for all further information regarding this procurement. Interested offerors are required to download the RFP and all related documents attached to this notice. 
Note: Offerors must only submit written electronic (email) questions during the proposal preparation period. Questions must be submitted by June 10th to allow BIA adequate time to prepare and post responses to all Offerors questions. All questions shall be directed to the Contracting Officer: Tom Moomaw at leo.moomaw@bia.gov.
 No printed copies of the RFP will be available; offerors must download these documents from this notice.
Basis for Award
The Government shall evaluate proposals for award based on a best value methodology. The award shall made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of all proposals received meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for technical evaluation factors i.e., specifications and delivery terms. The lowest priced proposal shall be based on the lowest total evaluated price received with option prices included. Award shall be made to the offeror(s) whose offer meets the Government's requirements and whose technical proposal and price represent the best value to the Government.
Offerors are encouraged to offer discounted pricing. 
The Government shall evaluate the following technical factors:
 Factor 1- Technical Understanding Offerors will be evaluated on their technical understanding of the SOW presented in the written technical proposals. Offerors will be evaluated on their demonstrated understanding of the technical requirements implicit in each performance requirement. Offerors will be evaluated on their understanding of the importance and interrelationship of these requirements and how a well-planned and executed technical approach can achieve BIE's objectives in an efficient, timely, and cost-effective manner. Because multiple tasks may be in progress at any given time, offerors will be evaluated on how they address their firm's technical approach from this perspective rather than focusing on the approach for an individual task. In addition, offerors will be evaluated on their experience in resolving problems similar in nature to the ones expected to occur in the performance of this contract.  Factor 2- Management Approach
Offerors will be evaluated on their management approach information presented in the written technical proposals. Offerors will be evaluated on a demonstration of corporate ability to undertake and effectively manage the technical, personnel, and financial aspects of a technical contract of the magnitude and complexity similar to this contract's work requirements, so as to ensure effective, efficient, timely, and responsive support. Offerors will be evaluated on how they plan to effectively meet the requirements of the contract through the roles and responsibilities of their employees and team members; lines of authority and communication within the organization; and their ability to integrate the complex tasks of the SOW and oversee their concurrent implementation. Offerors will be evaluated on how they demonstrate their ability to resolve potential problems arising during contract performance and demonstrate their approach to maintaining a high degree of responsiveness to the periodic, unpredictable nature of activities associated with the SOW.   Factor 3-Past Performance
Offerors' past performance will be evaluated based on the information obtained by contacting the Offerors' supplied references and/or on other information obtained by the Government from other sources. Offerors will be evaluated on previous customer satisfaction in areas including quality of performance, technical knowledge, timeliness of performance, cost control, management approach, key personnel availability and participation in completing work, and overall satisfaction. Additionally, the Offerors will be evaluated on the relevance of their previous experience to the task areas of the SOW programs it supports.
Offerors with no past performance history, whose past performance history is clearly not relevant, or for whom past performance data is not available, will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance for those reasons. Every attempt will be made to ascertain meaningful past performance information on which the offeror's prior performance can be evaluated. 
Price 
The schedule contractor's proposed pricing will be evaluated for price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.4 and Part 31. The Government will evaluate price proposals for award purposes by adding the total price for all ordering periods.  As the evaluation of proposals approaches equality, price becomes more important in making the award determination.  In the event that two or more proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), award may be made to the lower priced offer.  It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced proposal if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit.  The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated proposal, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source
Solicitation Number: R11PS30293
THIS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE IS ADVERTISED AS AN INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.   As provided under FAR 6.302-1, this Project will be solicited on a noncompetitive basis as "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  
Project Description: The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement to provide technical training to accomplish computer programming changes needed to fulfill the migration requirements. Reclamation personnel will implement programming changes in computer applications, and communications system hardware which has been integrated into the Hoover SCADA system.  Contractor training is essential to accomplish the software and communications control modifications necessary to comply with IT security requirements.  Specifically, the goal of these tasks is train Hoover personnel how to create and modify Hoover's backend software that eliminates the use of Intellution FIX32 software in Hoover SCADA systems, allowing for the final migration to the newer Proficy iFIX software.     
This training will allow multiple government personnel to provide future software and systems modifications and maintenance.  The key feature of this contract is to provide in-depth training of the unique custom software that interfaces with FIX that controls and monitors the Hoover SCADA system.  IAP Services has unique capabilities to accomplish this work based on experience with the Hoover Dam's older Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) based and new Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)-based SCADA systems.  IAP Services has authored and edited the bulk of the applications needed to operate the dam and have the only personnel qualified to provide training on these applications. They understand the details of the programming used in Hoover's SCADA system and the functional goals of the system in the power plant.  They are the only ones with knowledge of both the custom Reclamation RTU protocols and the new PLC interface that are required to make the transition.  The Hoover SCADA structure and implementation are unique; knowledge and capabilities relative to other power plants is not transferrable to Hoover Dam.
Award is anticipated in June 30, 2011. The project period of performance is anticipated to begin July 1, 2011 with an anticipated completion date of June 30, 2012. The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price type.  
All responsible sources are welcome to submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation by June 10, 2011 4:00 PM Pacific Standard Time for consideration.   
The contract award information will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website (FBO) at (www.fedbizopps.gov).  The Justification and Approval for using noncompetitive procedures will be posted after an award is made at the following address: http://www.usbr.gov/mso/aamd/doing-business-acquisitions-noncompetitive.html 
Questions may be submitted to Brian Switzer at bswitzer@usbr.gov or call 702-293-8514.

<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Science, intends to award a sole source contract to Spark Holland, Inc/Ichrom Solutions, 186 Mantoloking Road, Suite #7, Brick, NJ 08723-5888 for the Maintenance of the Spark Holland Instruments. <br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is a&nbsp;8 month base period and four 12 month options. <br />The purpose of this procurement is for Spark Holland to provide annual preventative maintenance service as well as emergency on-site support in the event the instruments fail to work properly. The&nbsp;Symbiosis Solid Phase Extraction (SPE)&nbsp;unit require extensive programming capable of automatically exchanging the SPE cartridges in a way that is completely synchronized with the operation of the system pump and mass spectrometer data collection.&nbsp; <br />Spark Holland is the only responsible source capable of meeting all of the Government's requirement because they are the original equipment manufacture of the instruments and they are the only company capable of maintaining the systems.&nbsp; The Spark Holland trained engineers periodically receive service information and updates often consisting of compilation of recent problems and suggested methods of correction. These service information reports are only distributed to the personnel trained and actively employed by Spark Holland. The exchange of cartridges is needed to ensure validity of the analytical results because of the complexity of the serum matrix.&nbsp; The equipment provides an on-line solid phase extraction.&nbsp; <br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to the Spark Holland. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications to provide the services to Richard Jenkins via email ONLY at <a href="mailto:RJenkins@cdc.gov">RJenkins@cdc.gov</a> with the solicitation number 2011-N-13394 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN April 27, 2011. <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This RFI is set aside for Small Business.<br />Description of Services/Supplies: Next Generation Genome Sequencing Bioinformatics Pipeline
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) to identify the capabilities of the marketplace of all interested parties. This is not a request for Proposals.<br /><br />This request is for information and planning purposes as part of market survey only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any future solicitation. No official solicitation exists; therefore, please do not request a copy of a solicitation. If in the future an official solicitation is released, there is no guarantee that sources responding to this RFI will be included on the source list. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.</p>
<p>The FDA makes no implied or in fact contract by issuing this RFI. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the FDA's view of the information received. Do not send any material that requires a non-disclosure agreement or that may be business sensitive. Responses received that include a non-disclosure agreement or identify information that is business sensitive will not be accepted. Responses to this notice will not be returned.</p>
<p>1. Mission and Objectives</p>
<p>Whole genome DNA sequencing (WGS) with next generation platforms is no longer restricted to large sequencing centers but can be conducted in private laboratories with relative ease. In addition, these platforms no longer come with the "big science" price tag of millions but can be fairly inexpensive (as little as $60k) with prices becoming all the more competitive. However, these newer systems yield raw sequencing reads that require significant bioinformatic expertise to utilize, manipulate, and ultimately conduct comparative assessments considering the size and volume of a given data set. Adding to the complexity is the evolving scale of information to be extracted from the massive sequencing datasets indicative of the starting material: from single strain, mixed populations, and extending into full metagenomic communities. From a general perspective, WGS is becoming entrenched in the near future as the state-of-the-art gold standard and will require individual laboratory competency and utility in this area. It is clear that the current bottleneck is secondary and tertiary extraction/derivatives of the information that currently requires highly trained bioinformatics personnel. It is ultimately a cost benefit to automate the process pipeline to translate raw sequence to useable and recognizable data based on comparative assessments.</p>
<p>This work may ultimately support and integrate WGS data, in a modular fashion, into the Pathogen Annotated Tracking and Resource Network (PATRN) that is currently under contract in CFSAN/OARSA/DVA. Certainly, a variation on this fundamental need can translate into the functional genomics realm to enumerate, categorize, and characterize in true digital quantity and quality changes occurring at the RNA level. In aggregate, this work supports FDA/CFSAN related-mission to delineate and/or develop methodology for the microbiological and molecular identification of foodborne pathogenic bacteria. In addition, this pipeline may allow unique markers to surface rapidly that are important not only in identification and subtyping but relate to host or food reservoir.</p>
<p>Deliverables</p>
<p>The desired deliverable for this requisition would involve a simplified (point and click) bioinformatic software-based utility package for handling/integrating raw genomic sequence data reads from a next generation sequencing platform. The utility package would essentially convert raw reads with proper interfacing with genomic sequence databases (such as GenBank) into easily identifiable DNA polymorphisms with functional genomic annotation information as outlined in the statement of work.</p>
<p>2. Period of Performance/Basis <br />10/1/2011 To 09/30/2012</p>
<p>3. Source Selection Procedures/Criteria</p>
<p>The equipment must meet the technical requirements listed under the SOW/PWS. The evaluation factors for this solicitation will be the ability to meet the technical requirements, compatibility with existing systems and past performance will comprise the major percentage of the evaluation factors. The Government reserves the right to select the system that will offer best value. The vendor will have an established record of being able to service their systems, provide technical assistance and have the service contracts available for additional funding. Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered. The Government may award this purchase order to other than the lowest price technically acceptable quote. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," and 2) Price. Technical Capability is significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>4. EIT. <br />Approval of the OPDIV/OS Section 508 Official or designee is required when claiming an exception to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (see the HHS Section 508 policy at http://www.hhs.gov/od/508policy/index.html )</p>
<p>This may ultimately support and integrate whole genome sequencing into the Pathogen Annotated Tracking and Resource Network (PATRN) that is currently under contract in CFSAN/OARSA/DVA.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA is soliciting on a full and open competitive basis for Dual-Mode Airborne Digital Data Transmitters to meet the Governments requirements. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (FFP-IDIQ) three year contract with a maximum of 500 Dual-Mode Airborne Transmitters to be purchased and a minimum of 120 units.  A solicitation will be issued on or about 20 June 2011.  The Government estimates that an award will be made early November 2011.  The transmitters will be used in the AIM-9X AN/DKT-89 Secure Telemetry System.  The transmitter defined in this specification is intended to satisfy the recurring need for Department of Defense (DoD) Test and Evaluation (T&E) organizations to acquire quantitative vehicle health, subsystem health, performance, JAMI Time, Space, Position Information (JTU TSPI) and other performance related information during live tests of various missiles and missile-like platforms.
  The transmitters are typically used only once.  These transmitters are subjected to extremes of temperature, vibration, acceleration, shock, and vehicle electrical system transients.  They must exhibit a very high probability of successful, one-time use after initial acceptance testing, potentially long storage periods, and after extensive captive flight testing prior to missile launch.  The transmitter has a user-selectable modulation scheme.  The modulation schemes available for selection are Pulse Code Modulation/Frequency Modulation (PCM/FM), also known as Advanced Range Telemetry (ARTM) tier 0 and Shaped-Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying  Telemetry Group (SO-QPSK-TG), also known as ARTM Tier 1.
  The center frequency of the transmitter is field-programmable by the user with the ability to increment the center frequency in 1.0 MHz steps.  The Contractor/Vendor shall have a qualified Dual-Mode Airborne Digital Data Transmitter in accordance with the requirements defined in the Performance Specification for Dual-Mode Airborne Digital Transmitters before contract award.  All qualifying documentation of the Dual-Mode Airborne Digital Transmitters shall be included with their proposal.  Delivery of the Dual-Mode Airborne Digital Data Transmitters will be Free On Board (F.O.B.) Destination and within 90 days After Receipt of Order (ARO).  Delivery of qualified transmitters is estimated to begin 90 days after an award is made.
  All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  Quesitons may be submitted to NAWCWD Contract Specialist John P. McLaughlin by email (preferred):  john.p.mclaughlin@navy.mil, fax to (760) 939-3095, or mail to Commander Code 220000D, NAWCWD, 429 E. Bowen Ave, MS 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108.

These items require Government Source Approval prior to award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.
 Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items has been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source, you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVICP Source Approval Brochure which can be obtained on the internet at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps. 

Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the source approval brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of this requirement may be continued based on Fleet support needs.
All contractual documents (i.e.
 contracts, purchase orders, task orders, delivery orders and modifications) related to the instant procurement are considered to be "issued" by the Government when copies are either deposited in the mail, transmitted by facsimile, or sent by other electronic commerce methods, such as email. The Governments acceptance of the contractors proposal constitutes bilateral agreement to "issue" contractual documents as detailed herein.

<SUBJECT>BARDA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Advanced Research and Development of Personal Protective Equipment, Ventilators, and Diagnostics
<SOLNBR>11-100-SOL-00021
<ARCHDATE>06172011
<CONTACT>Flu-BAA@hhs.gov Flu-BAA@hhs.gov, Email Flu-BAA@hhs.gov
<DESC>BARDA is the lead federal agency for the advanced development of medical countermeasures (MCM) to protect the United States against public health emergency threats, including chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear agents, emerging infectious diseases, and pandemic influenza. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic exemplified the unpredictability and rapidity with which a novel influenza strain can impact the world's population. With a historic effort from both government and industry partners, vaccines were developed and available to the public six months after the initial outbreak. Despite high infection rates, the 2009 H1N1 virus was only mildly pathogenic, with relatively low rates of accompanying morbidity and mortality in the overall population. However, it is possible that future pandemics will feature morbidity and mortality rates comparable with historically more severe pandemics such as 1918 and 1957. The ever-present and ever-evolving threat of pandemic influenza presents a compelling need to optimize available medical countermeasures and develop entirely new modalities for prevention and treatment of influenza disease. This BAA will support advanced development activities to improve personal protective equipment, ventilators, clinical influenza test systems and diagnostic tools.
<p>The Pandemic and All Hazard Preparedness Act directs BARDA to promote (i) innovations in technologies that may assist MCM advanced research and development, (ii) research and development of tools, devices, and technologies, and (iii) research to promote strategic initiatives, such as rapid diagnostics, broad spectrum antimicrobials, and vaccine manufacturing technologies. The priorities of the BARDA Influenza Division are closely aligned with the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza (Nov, 2005), the National Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan (May, 2005), recommendations from the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise Review (Aug, 2010) and the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology report on influenza vaccines manufacturing (Aug, 2010). The HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise Review emphasizes the need to improve medical countermeasure technologies and move towards a "nimble, flexible capacity to produce MCMs rapidly in the face of any attack or threat".</p>
<p><br />The purpose of this BAA is to solicit proposals that focus on one or more of the following solicited areas of interest.</p>
<p>Development Areas of Interest:<br />&bull; Personal Protective Equipment and Full-Featured Continuous Ventilators for Influenza Infection &amp; All-Hazards<br />&bull; Clinical Influenza Test Systems and Diagnostic Tools</p>
<p>The Government intends to have a full &amp; open competition for this requirement in the form of a BAA, which is anticipated to be issued on June 21, 2011. The Government expects to make one or more awards, subject to the availability of funds, over the period of one year.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning data to supplement weather observations at all FAA-owned automated weather stations (Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) and Automated Weather Sensor System (AWSS)).  Lightning data is delivered through an Internet Protocol (IP) and received at an ASOS/AWOS Data Acquisition System (ADAS).  The ADAS then sends data in latitude/longitude pairs with a time stamp, intensity, polarity and quality factor in binary form.  An ADAS module, the Automated Lightning Detection and Reporting System (ALDARS), takes the FAA reformatted data package and distributes the information to the appropriate FAA-owned automated weather systems.  The FAA also uses the lightning data for Integrated terminal Weather Systems (ITWS), Corridor Integrated Weather Systems (CIWS) and research & development (R&D) organizations within the FAA.  The end-users for the lightning data are pilots and air traffic controllers. The FAA requirements include CG lightning data from Zone 1 (CONUS), Zone 2 (Alaska) and Zone 3 (Hawaii).
The period of performance is anticipated to be for one (1) base year and four (4) option years.  In the base year, the lightning data must be delivered as a continuous feed, 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, via internet protocol (IP), and during the four (4) option years the lightning data must be delivered via T1 line as the primary method and IP as the secondary [back-up] method. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code has been identified as "518210, Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services".  FAA will consider vendor suggestions for use of other NAICS codes consistent with the areas of interest described above. 
The FAA is surveying the market to seek potential vendors capable of meeting technical and delivery requirements for CG lightning data in Zones 1, 2 and 3. The acquisition strategy for this procurement has not been determined at this time.  However, either a full and open competition or a set-aside in all or in part for small businesses, service disabled veteran owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses certified by the SBA for participation in the 8(a) program will be chosen depending on the responses to the market survey. This market survey is to provide information to the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition and to determine if adequate competition exists. The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate Small Business Office 8(a) and other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.  
The FAA requires copies of certification letters for interested service disabled veteran owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.
Any vendor capable of providing lightning data is invited to submit a statement of capabilities addressing its abilities to meet the FAA's requirements.  The statement of capabilities must include, but is not limited to, the following parameters for Zones 1, 2 & 3:  horizontal resolution, location accuracy, reporting frequency, data latency, detection efficiency, probability of false detection, reliability, timing accuracy, polarity, peak current, flash multiplicity and archiving capabilities. 
The following attachments are part of this Market Survey:Attachment A:  Draft Statement of WorkAttachment B:  Business Declaration Form

All technical questions are to be directed to Chris Schoneman at (760) 348-5278, x227 and contractual questions to Shannon Blackburn at (503) 872-2825.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  Performance Work Statement should meet the requirements for the following Statement of Objectives.
I.	Purpose:
Sonny Bono Salton Sea NWR needs electrical power at a remote site where there is no power supply. The electricity is needed to power two water pumps, each with a power requirement of 3 phase, 220 volt, 7.5 HP.

II. 	Scope or Mission:
In addition to the basic electrical requirement to electrify pumps for moving water, the intent of this project is to accomplish this project using solar technology, either with Stirling Engine generators or Organic Rankine Cycle turbine generators, or similar technology. The location of the project site is in one of the hottest regions of the United States, making the potential for solar power generation very feasible. The site is at the southeast shore of the Salton Sea in Imperial County, California where a habitat restoration project is being planned.  No city quality water is available at the site so water for cleaning will need to be hauled as needed. The closest site of this quality water is at the refuge maintenance yard 1.5 miles away. 
III.	Period and Place of Performance;
Electrical supply is expected to be needed by Dec 31, 2013. The electrical supply will be needed near Red Hill Bay, approximately 1 mile northeast of the Sonny Bono Salton Sea NWR headquarters office. Access to the site will either be from Garst Rd. or Red Hill Marina County Park.

IV. 	Background:
This project is part of an attempt to restore wetland bird habitat of the Salton Sea, an area of extremely high migratory bird value and use. Project planners intend to use screw pump technology to lift water uphill from the current shoreline of the Salton Sea to blend with upstream fresher water, keeping the current shoreline of the Salton Sea wet. A screw pump manufacturer has estimated that we would need a single 36 inch screw pump running at 50 rpm 24 hrs/day to lift 5 cfs of water 6 feet, plus another single pump for standby. Because we are requesting a solar source of electricity, we are increasing the estimated number of pumps to 2 considering they would only be running during daylight hours.  The Salton Sea is drying out and its wildlife habitat values are diminishing. Because the Salton Sea is drying out the site can be very dusty, sometimes the dust is high in salts which may be corrosive. This fact and considering the technologies requested are generally more efficient at generating power, we are not requesting Photovoltaic electricity. Developing an alternative source of electricity is good for a variety of reasons: 1, Electricity is needed. 2, abundant sunshine/heat is available most of the year. 3, for the comparative cost of routing powerlines to the site, it is probably more efficient to develop a solar source of power. And 4, using a solar technology blend well with the environmental stewardship concept of habitat maintenance. Additionally there is a potential need for solar derived electricity at other potential habitat restoration sites around the Salton Sea in a modular style if perfected and demonstrated well.
No construction has begun yet. The project is being planned and environmental documentation prepared. These two parts of the project are expected to be complete by Dec. 31 2012.

V. 	Performance Objectives:
1.	Generate 3 phase, 220 volt electricity sufficient to operate two 7.5 HP motors.  
2.	Electricity needs to be solar generated power.
3.	Solar generators can not depend on a continuous supply of fresh water for cleaning, cooling etc.
4.	The system must perform during daylight hours of every sunny day of the year. The system should be low maintenance to operate, other than occasional cleaning and scheduled maintenance (no more than weekly attention).
5.	Replacement parts for all aspects of the generating system must be commercially available or easily machined at a local machine shop. The vendor must be able to provide a separate first year on-call Service agreement with a response time of no more than 48 hours after a service request. Depending on the complexity of the system and the refuge's ability to perform independent future generator maintenance, engineered drawings may be requested of the vendor sufficient for a qualified electrician to make repairs to any part of the system or build a new unit if necessary. Vendors not able to provide drawings and schematics upon request are not eligible to respond to this request for proposals.
6.	A security fence will be needed. Either a temporary fence can be installed to secure the site during construction by the vendor and a permanent fence installed afterward by the Government, or a permanent fence installed by the vendor. This part can be negotiated.

VI.	Operating Constraints:
The site where electricity is needed is on silty deposits of a lakebed. Some site preparation will be required before installation begins. Area for reflectors, dishes or concentrators is essentially not limited.
The project site is in Imperial County, California, a rural county with farming as a primary industry. Parts and supplies to build or maintain a newer technology may not be available locally. 
The government does not have dedicated staff to operate a power generating facility on a daily basis. Therefore it is imperative that the provided technology be relatively low maintenance.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:<br /><br /></span></strong>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSSN) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) on behalf of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB).<br /><br />The purpose of this SBSSN is to identify qualified small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-owned Small Businesses (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)] that are interested in and capable of providing the services described below.<br /><br />The NHLBI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this SBSSN, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP).<br /><br />The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns [particularly Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-owned Small Businesses (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)] under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 611710 with a business size standard of $7.0 Million.<br /><br />Based on the responses received from this Sources Sought Notice, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Notice must have the capabilities to provide the services described below.<br /><br /><strong>INTRODUCTION<br /></strong><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:<br /><br /></span></strong>The lack of diversity in the science and engineering workforce stems from an underproduction of underrepresented students in science and engineering at every level of postsecondary education, with a progressive loss of representation as we proceed up the academic ladder. The potential science and engineering workforce is drawn primarily from among our nation's undergraduates who complete at least a bachelor's degree in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. The primary problem in increasing diversity representation in these fields is the limited size of this pool of potential talent. Unfortunately, most NIH training programs are focused largely, if not exclusively, on an academic career and directed at later stages of the academic pipeline, supporting graduate and postgraduate diversity candidates, rather than enlarging the pool of potential diversity scientists and engineers by identifying and preparing promising undergraduate diversity candidates for graduate and postgraduate study.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Objectives:<br /></span></strong><br />The mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) is to improve human health by leading the development and accelerating the application of biomedical imaging and bioengineering technologies. The institute is also committed, as detailed in its strategic plan, to using research training programs and program initiatives to attract and increase the participation of under-represented populations in science and engineering.
<p>The NIBIB expects that the project supported by the planned contract award will test the effectiveness of faculty, student, and peer-to-peer mentoring; professional development; social networking; and exposure to academic and industrial research experiences in increasing the number of underrepresented students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. We also expect that the outcome and &lsquo;best practices' gained from this project will help design future programs designed to increase the undergraduate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) diversity pipeline and to direct students in this pipeline to productive biomedical research careers.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope of Work:<br /><br /></span></strong>Offerors must propose an integrated set of integrated academic, financial, mentoring, professional development, and social networking program activities that address the objectives of the solicitation. The proposed activities should take place largely, if not exclusively, during the academic year at the offeror's institution and recruit and support a small (12 or more) group of underrepresented undergraduates in one or more Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. All trainees recruited into the program will be expected to fully commit to all program activities, including one or two summer research internships, occurring between their sophomore and junior years and, if in a four-year setting, between their junior and senior years. Program participants, once selected, should not be dismissed from the program by the offeror's institution. Offerors should, however, have defined procedures for recapturing stipends and replacing students who voluntarily choose to leave the offeror's program or institution before program completion.<br /><br />NIBIB expects that the offeror's institution will develop new or adapt existing courses on Time Management, Professional Development, Research Preparation, and Career Counseling and will require program participants to enroll and actively participate in these courses in addition to their other required coursework. The institution should also have procedures in place to ensure that program participants who have not had adequate exposure to STEM-related coursework receive more preparatory assistance and encouragement to succeed academically in these courses. This assistance may also include program tutoring or remedial courses in mathematics and other important STEM prerequisites. <br /><br />NIBIB expects that strong and effective mentoring from administrative staff, advisory staff, and research faculty will be a key component of the proposed program. The offeror's institution should make all program staff, advisory staff, and research faculty aware of the aims and goals of the program. Where possible, student entering should be provided by gender- and diversity-appropriate mentors with strong backgrounds in mentoring underrepresented undergraduates. Where this is not available, the offeror's institution should provide additional training to program mentors to make them aware of the challenges faced by underrepresented undergraduates and more effective at helping program participants meet and overcome these challenges. All program participants should also have at least one program-assigned faculty advisor who can direct them to appropriate help with academic, professional, or social problems.<br />&nbsp;<br />In addition to the above mentoring, the offeror's institution should make every effort to institute a corp d'esprit among program participants and help facilitate peer-to-peer mentoring, both among program participants and between program participants and other underrepresented students at their institution. NIBIB expects that the offeror's institution will create a social network of family, faculty mentors, and peer-peer mentors that will link program participants into a 'virtual community' dedicated to helping these students to succeed. The offeror's institution will also be expected to continue to offer mentoring support and career guidance to program participants as they transition to four-year colleges and universities, graduate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs, or research positions in the industrial sector.<br /><br />NIBIB expects that the offeror's institution will attempt to provide both research preparation and, if possible, hands-on academic-year or summer research experiences for program participations. The offeror's institutions should also give program participants the opportunity to travel to appropriate national meetings and workshops to introduce them to potential future mentors, colleagues, and the general biomedical research community. NIBIB also expects that program activities at the offeror's institution will be supplemented by off-site summer research internships in both the academic and industrial environment. These off-site summer research experiences, carried out in partnership with the NIH intramural program and NIBIB-identified biomedical imaging and biomedical device companies, will provide additional scientific and professional development to program participants and expose them to biomedical research in both the academic and industrial environments. The NIH intramural research program supports many summer enrichment programs that provide training opportunities for underrepresented undergraduate students. These include the Community College Student Enrichment Program (CCSEP), the NIH Summer Internship Program (SIP), the NIBIB Bioengineering Summer Internship Program (BESIP), the Undergraduate Scholarship Program (UGSP), and the NIH Academy. These programs, by supporting full-time summer research experiences in NIH intramural laboratories and enhancing analytical, communication, and presentation skills, will better prepare participants to enter graduate STEM programs and undertake careers in biomedical research. Similar research experiences, undertaken in the industrial environment, will help program participants to appreciate the similarities and differences of the academic and industrial research environments. For both on-site and off-site research experiences, program participants should be required to present their research results to program mentors and other program participants.<br /><br /><strong>To be deemed capable, your organization must submit a written capability statement. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will be evaluated against the following technical areas:<br /></strong><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical evaluation criteria:<br /></span></strong><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(1) Understanding of the problem and appropriateness of the proposed approach <br /><br />(2) Appropriateness and innovativeness of the proposed program activities <br /><br />(3) Institutional environment, including programs, facilities, and personnel, devoted to undergraduate diversity <br /><br />(4) Institutional commitment, including past training record, to undergraduate diversity <br /><br />(5) Appropriateness of program tracking and evaluation plans <br /><br />(6) Demonstate that the offeror has performed similar work in the past.<br /></span></strong><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated Period of Performance:<br /><br /></span></strong>The anticipated period of performance for this award is December 1, 2011 through November 30, 2015.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capability Statement/Information Sought:<br /><br /></span></strong>Small businesses that believe that they have the ability to satisfy all of the above stated Project Requirements, and who meet the stated size standard, are encouraged to submit a capability statement.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations &amp; Field Studies (DSHEFS), Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) Program, hereby announces its intent to sole source purchase orders to the Public Health Divisions in the states of Wisconsin, Tennessee, New Jersey, Iowa, New York, Texas, Alabama, California, Ohio, Missouri, Kansas, and Pennsylvania.
<p>The Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) Program is a state-based surveillance system under which participating States provide information to NIOSH on laboratory reported blood lead levels among adults. The current ABLES case definition for elevated blood lead level for adults (age 16 and older) is a blood lead level concentration &ge;10 &micro;g/dL (ten micrograms per deciliter).</p>
<p>The ABLES program ultimately aims to collect the complete list of variables for all blood lead level tests, and urges all States to progressively supply this information as it becomes available. These data must be submitted providing a field for the 19 variables listed even if some variables have no data available at the time of submission. An EXCEL spreadsheet is the preferred method and a Microsoft Access table or delimited text file is also acceptable.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting of this notice, their written capabilities statement, in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Forward to Denise Rains, 315 East Montgomery Avenue, Spokane, WA 99207, fax (509)354-8099, or email dgr8@cdc.gov. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractors Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract. The website is www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be held with the various states as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>SOLICIATION NOTICE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), 1090 Tusculum, Cincinnati, Ohio 45226-1938 has a requirement for services for recruitment, coordination and management of small construction business owner interviews for exploring the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) of small construction businesses in the Cincinnati, Ohio area.
<p>This requirement is solicited as unrestricted.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />Recruitment, Coordination and Management of Small Construction Business Owner Interviews for Exploring the OSH Needs of Small Construction Businesses in the Cincinnati, Ohio area</p>
<p>I. Background</p>
<p>Construction had the most fatal injuries of any sector, with 1,178 fatalities in 2006 (21% of total) (U.S. Dept. of Labor, 2008). More than 79% of construction businesses employ fewer than 10 employees (CPWR, 2007), and this establishment size experiences the highest fatality rate within construction (U.S. Dept. of Labor, 2008). The need for reaching this population with effective, affordable, and culturally appropriate training has been documented in publications and is increasingly becoming an institutional priority at NIOSH. This study will collect information from small construction business (SCB) owners with 10 or fewer employees regarding their businesses' specific OSH training needs, motivational factors, and preferred information sources and use it to develop recommendations for tailoring OSH training interventions for small businesses in the construction industry.</p>
<p>II. Project Objectives</p>
<p>To better understand the occupational safety and health (OSH) needs of small construction businesses (SCBs), and to inform methods that will successfully motivate SCB owners to seek OSH training relevant to their unique work situations, key-informant perceptions and opinions will be gathered via in-depth interviews with 30 small construction business owners with 10 or fewer employees in the greater Cincinnati, Ohio area. Data gathered from in-depth interviews will be used in subsequent phases of the study for the development of a survey to assess the occupational safety and health needs and motivators for seeking OSH information among small construction business owners. That is, the results of these interviews will be analyzed to identify common sets of responses, and these responses will be used in the development of a survey that will identify SCB owners businesses' specific training needs, motivational factors, and preferred information sources which will inform the design and implementation of future interventions.</p>
<p>III. Scope of Work</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to provide services for the recruitment, coordination and compensation of 30 interviews to small construction business owners regarding specific OSH training needs, motivational factors, and preferred information sources. NIOSH researchers will conduct the interviews, and the contractor will manage all other aspects of recruitment, scheduling, logistics, and participant compensation. The interviews will be administered in the Greater Cincinnati, Ohio area. Respondents for the interviews will be owners of small construction businesses with 10 or fewer employees. Within the scope of this contract, the logistics of recruiting participants for the interviews will include providing any compensation to the participants for their time.</p>
<p>IV. Detailed Technical Requirements</p>
<p>Summary of Tasks or Phases</p>
<p>Task 1: Develop recruitment and interview coordination plan.</p>
<p>Task 2: Recruit respondents, coordinate interviews, and compensate respondents.</p>
<p>Description of Specific Tasks or Phases</p>
<p>Task 1: Develop recruitment and interview coordination plan.<br />The contractor will be responsible for developing a plan detailing how the recruitment for the interviews will occur. The plan should include details on recruiting methodology including, but not limited to, how potential participants will be identified and approached for participation in the study, examples of recruitment materials used in the study, planned geographic scope (within the Greater Cincinnati, Ohio area) of recruiting efforts. Particular attention will be given to how recruiting efforts will ensure that a broad range of sub-sectors within construction are represented in the sample. For example, no more than 3 respondents should be recruited from a specific subsector or NAICS code. The plan should also include details regarding the administration of the interview including, but not limited to, where the interview will be administered (i.e. in respondent's home, at a public location, at a scheduled time in an office, etc.), when the interview will take place, and when reminder communications will be delivered to respondents. Special attention will be given to how respondents' privacy will be protected during recruitment and the interview. The plan should also include a schedule for completion of the data collection. The interview instrument itself will be developed by the NIOSH researchers.</p>
<p>The recruiters should be familiar with the local construction community and basic interview administration procedures. The contractor will host a one day workshop to provide an opportunity for NIOSH researchers to review the data collection tool with the recruiters to ensure basic questions by potential respondents can be adequately addressed. Basic questions may include inquiries regarding the purpose of the study or compensation procedures. The contractor will oversee general logistics of the workshop related to the host facility, including but not limited to: providing scheduling reminders and driving directions to participants and ensuring basic provisions (refreshments, lunch, and bathroom facilities). In addition, the contractor will be responsible for informing the NIOSH researchers of the recruiting plan and coordinating the day to day logistics of the data collection.</p>
<p>Delivery, Review, and Payment</p>
<p>The time frame for completion of task 1 is within 3 months of the award of this contract. The contractor will provide a written report of the recruitment plan and meet with NIOSH researchers to discuss/modify the plan as necessary. The contractor will also provide a proposed schedule for the data collection. The contractor must also confirm its capability (i.e., demonstrate a mechanism) to provide compensation to the respondents at the conclusion of each interview. The NIOSH project officer will review the report and confirm that the requirements have been met. Upon acceptance of the recruitment plan, partial payment of 20% of the contract award may be authorized.</p>
<p>Task 2: Recruit respondents, coordinate interviews, and compensate respondents.</p>
<p>Task 2 will not begin until the NIOSH project officer notifies the contractor that OMB approval has been obtained. This may result in a delay of approximately 6-9 months from the date of contract award. The contractor will follow the approved task 1 recruitment plan to recruit respondents and coordinate 30 interviews with small construction business owners from a broad range of construction subsectors to identify the unique OSH training needs, motivational factors, and preferred information sources . SCB owner respondents should be currently operating a construction business with 10 or fewer employees in the Greater Cincinnati, Ohio area. The contractor will be responsible for managing all logistics related to the data collection including but not limited to; ensuring that the respondents meet the qualifications specified in the apporved recruitment plan, providing a detailed interview schedule including interviewee contact information, date, location, and time, and providing compensation to interviewees for their time and travel expenses.</p>
<p>All travel in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations.</p>
<p>Recruitment will be performed until a minimum of 30 interviews have been completed. The contractor must also be able to set up a mechanism for providing each respondent with compensation for his/her time.</p>
<p>Delivery, Review, and Payment</p>
<p>The time frame for completion of task 2 is within 3 months of the notification of OMB approval. Partial payment may be authorized following completion of data collection and submission of completed compensation accounting for each group of 10 respondents in the study until a maximum of 3 payments is achieved. Billing for partial payment in task 2 may be submitted following the delivery of completed compensation accounting records for each group of 10 participants. The NIOSH project officer will confirm from the completed interview instruments that all the scheduled interviews have been administered so that payment may be authorized. Upon receipt of the final 10 compensation accounting reports will confirm the completion of task 2 and the contract as a whole so that the final payment for the balance of the contract may be authorized.</p>
<p>Description of End Products/deliverables</p>
<p>Task 1: Recruitment and interview coordination plan.</p>
<p>Task 2: Completed compensation accounting report for <br />respondents. May be subdivided into as many as 3 payments <br />(one following the submission of each group of 10 completed <br />respondent compensation records.)</p>
<p>V. Reporting Schedule</p>

<p>Task 2: Completed compensation accounting report for <br />respondents. May be subdivided into as many as 3 payments <br />(one following the submission of each groupof 10 completed <br />respondent compensation records.) within 3 months of OMB approval*</p>
<p>*Note: Due to potential delays related to mandated Office of Management and Budget oversight review timelines may need to be extended.</p>
<p>VI. Special Considerations</p>
<p>In order to ensure the quality of the data the contractor will have 1) strong ties to the construction industry in the Greater Cincinnati area, 2) past experience recruiting participants for occupational safety and health research in the construction industry in the Greater Cincinnati, Ohio area, and 3) past experience recruiting small businesses for participation in occupational safety and health research.</p>

The regulations provide a systematic means, based on established ethical principles, to safeguard the rights and welfare of individuals who participate as subjects in research activities supported or conducted by HHS.<br />(b) The regulations define a human subject as a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or identifiable private information. The regulations extend to the use of human organs, tissue, and body fluids from individually identifiable human subjects as well as to graphic, written, or recorded information derived from individually identifiable human subjects.<br />The use of autopsy materials is governed by applicable State and local law and is not directly regulated by 45 CFR Part 46.<br />(c) Activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the categories set forth in 45 CFR 46.101(b)(1-6) are exempt from coverage.<br />(d) Inappropriate designations of the noninvolvement of human subjects or of exempt categories of research in a project may result in delays in the review of a proposal. The OPDIV will make a final determination of whether the proposed activities are covered by the regulations or are in an exempt category, based on the information provided in the proposal. In doubtful cases, prior consultation with OHRP, (telephone: 301-496-7014), is recommended.<br />(e) In accordance with 45 CFR Part 46 prospective Contractors being considered for award shall be required to file with OHRP an acceptable Assurance of Compliance with the regulations, specifying review procedures and assigning responsibilities for the protection of human subjects. The initial and continuing review of a research project by an institutional review board shall assure that the rights and welfare of the human subjects involved are adequately protected, that the risks to the subjects are reasonable in relation to the potential benefits, if any, to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained, and that informed consent will be obtained by methods that are adequate and appropriate.

The Contractor agrees that it has entered into this contract and will discharge its obligations, duties, and undertakings and the work pursuant thereto, whether requiring professional judgment or otherwise, as an independent contractor without imputing liability on the part of the Government for the acts of the Contractor or its employees.<br />(c) If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contracting Officer determines, in consultation with the OHRP, OPHS, ASH, that the Contractor is not in compliance with any of the requirements and/or standards stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the Contracting Officer may immediately suspend, in whole or in part, work and further payments under this contract until the Contractor corrects the noncompliance.

This solicitation will be available in electronic format only.  Interested parties may access the solicitation at: www.fedbizopps.gov. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCB-C4-07-0066-B (include the dashes). 

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.


The products or groups addressed in this solicitation are as follows: Special Item Numbers (SIN) 873-1 Mechanical Testing and Analysis Services, SIN 873-2 Chemical Testing and Analysis Services, 873-3 Electrical Testing and Analysis Services, 873-4 Geotechnical and Thermal/Fire Testing and Analysis Services, and, 873-99 Introduction of New Testing and Analysis Services.

The contract format and data requirements in this solicitation differ from previous solicitations. Offerors are strongly encouraged to carefully review the entire solicitation package before submission to ensure compliance with commercial item provisions. This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. The main changes to the solicitation are the implementation of the Goldstar Initiative. The Goldstar Initiative created the disclosure of current contract clauses in GSA eLibrary under each individual Schedule solicitation. FSS Contractors that have agreed to standard contract clauses without taking exception will receive a 'Goldstar' next to their name in GSA eLibrary. This solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by another refreshed solicitation.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />(h) Multiple awards.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

 This is a basic ordering agreement for the period from 08/01/2011 to 07/31/2012, in accordance with FAR 16.7.  A contract is formed, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this agreement, when VA agrees to place a patient into the nursing home which is currently listed on CCR.GOV, and the nursing home agrees to accept the patient.  Upon acceptance by the contractor of beneficiaries of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), all terms and conditions of this agreement shall apply during such time as a VA patient remains in that nursing home at the expense of VA.
 
 Upon acceptance of a VA patient by the nursing home, if and when requested by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative, the contractor shall furnish all supplies and services herein described, at the per diem rates for the levels of care specified below.  VA levels of care are defined in Section D of this agreement.  VA is obligated only to the extent authorized placements of patients are made under this agreement.
 
 B.2  RATE DETERMINATION
 
1.	The per diem rate is established by the current Medicaid rate for Medicaid approved nursing homes plus a fair market amount (percentage) to cover the cost of supplies, services, and equipment above that provided under Medicaid established by the local state Medicaid agency (SMA).  Rates established after the effective date of this contract will constitute a modification to the contract. Rates may be changed once during the annual continuation of the contract upon the receipt of updated Medicaid rates. Rate changes will not be paid retroactively.
 
2.	VA will use Medicaid rates for semi-private room, board, and routine nursing care.
 
3.	A percentage is added onto the current Medicaid rate for payment of all levels of nursing care and routine ancillary services/supplies, such as drugs, nursing supplies, oxygen (occasional use), x-ray, ECGs, Restorative Nursing Program, laboratory, physician visits, and rental equipment. No additional fees will be paid for routine care. Routine care will be provided to Veterans the same as it is provided to other Medicaid residents.

4.	Special equipment, (e.g. Clinitron bed), is not considered routine ancillary services, and may be provided by the VA under a Prosthetics Consult which may be requested through the CNH RN Case Manager.

5.	Monthly drug costs which comprise more than eight and one-half percent (8.5%) of the per diem rate are generally not considered routine ancillary supplies and will be reimbursed by the VA.  

6.	Hospice Care and Dialysis are not included in the rate.  VA or other payors may be used for Hospice and Dialysis, as determined by the veteran with VA approval. 

7.	Therapy must be intended to improve functioning, not to maintain functioning. Rehabilitation therapies will be provided as a distinct level of care for an authorized and limited amount of time as long as the Veteran is showing progress.

8.	The Rehabilitation Rate will be paid for the first seven days of a Veteran's admission in order to prevent a delay in care. Thereafter, prior to the initiation of any therapy, the CNH must provide the VA Community Specialty Services Nurse Manager with:

8.1	 A complete initial assessment for each therapy which is to be performed at the CNH. The initial assessment for each therapy must be performed by a licensed therapist and may not be charged to the VA. 
8.2	The initial assessment for each therapy must include a list of goals expected to be accomplished by that therapy, the specific plan of therapy, and an estimate of the expected time frame needed to accomplish the goals of therapy.  
8.3	The initial assessment for therapy provided by the CNH will be reviewed by VA personnel and a decision regarding authorization will be made. If authorized in writing, each therapy may not exceed 4 weeks of therapy, must be provided for no less than 5 times a week, and for no less than 65 minutes per therapy session, or for a total of 325 minutes per week.
      8.4 Once therapy has been authorized in writing by the VA and initiated, the CNH must provide 
             Therapy Progress Notes. These should summarize the therapy provided, and the progress, or lack
             of progress, made towards the stated goals. 
8.4	This information shall accompany the CNH's monthly billing invoice. Without this information the additional Rehabilitation Therapy per diem rates shall not be paid.
 
 B.3  MEDICATIONS
 
1.	Medications, which comprise more than 8.5% of the per diem rate on a monthly basis, are excluded from the per diem rate and will be reimbursed by the VA.  High medication costs will be determined or priced using the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) of the medications plus a transaction fee of 3% per month.  All calculations will be made on a monthly basis.  

2.	When a high cost drug is identified, VA staff must be advised promptly in order to establish an appropriate course of action, which may include the provision of the high cost drug by the VA.

3.	All Pharmacy costs for every VA beneficiary shall be attached to the invoice when submitted. Pharmacy costs are not to be added to the monthly per diem rate total. Failure to provide information in this manner shall result in delayed payments.

4.	The most recent Medication list for each Veteran will be provided to the VA in June and December when invoices are submitted.

B.5  DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK
 
1.	The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients.  Nursing Home care will be furnished to ensure that the total medical, nursing, and psycho-social needs of VA beneficiaries are met.  Routine Physician visits, laboratory, x-rays, ECGs, and other services for  VA beneficiaries will be at the same frequency as those provided to other Medicaid patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include semi-private room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) established in this contract will include the cost of medical care, routine ancillary services and supplies, such as drugs, nursing supplies, oxygen for occasional use, x-ray, ECGs, laboratory, physician visits, restorative nursing care, and rental equipment unless otherwise specifically excepted.

2.	Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living, to the maximum extent possible.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self care. 

3.	Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who require hospital care, will be admitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-VA facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained. This VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and shall not exceed 4 hours of admission to the non-VA facility. It is further agreed that admission to a VA facility shall be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit transfer for admission to a VA facility.

4.	If a Veteran receiving care under this agreement is hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility will arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the Veteran and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days shall be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but shall not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations, which is 15 days.  Payment shall follow state Medicaid regulations, which is 1/3 of the Basic per diem rate.  The VA facility shall include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the VA receives notification of the admission within 4 hours of the event, as noted above.

5.	The VA facility will approve Therapeutic Leave days for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a written therapeutic plan of care and pre-approved by VA staff.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year. Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations, which is 100% of basic per diem rate.  Exceptions may be approved by the VA facility Community Specialty Services Nurse Manager. 

6.	In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this contract dies, the nursing home will promptly notify the VA office that authorized the admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects pending further guidance by VA or the Veteran's family. Upon death of the Veteran, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.
 
7.	It is agreed that VA will have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the Veteran is rendered.
 
8.	The nursing home shall accept referral of and shall provide all services specified in this contract for any person determined eligible by the VA Under Secretary for Health or designee, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex, or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision. 

9.	Contracted Community Nursing Homes will provide the VA annually with their current and specific admission and exclusion criteria.
 
10.	It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow up supervision visits to Veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back to the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute for, nor relieve, the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the Veteran.
 
11.	All medical records concerning the Veteran's care in the nursing home will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge of the Veteran, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care. 

12.	Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient that includes at least the following:
 
12.1.  Admission identification record. 
12.2.  VA Form 10 1204, Referral for Community Nursing Home Care, or State-approved referral form. 
12.3.  Admitting evaluation (including diagnosis by nursing home physician).
 	12.4.  Physician orders.
 
12.5.  Progress notes.  The physician orders/notes shall be charted immediately after patient is seen. 
12.6.  Special reports (laboratory, x ray, activity, etc.). 
12.7.  SMA Patient Assessment Form . 
12.8.  Minimum Data Set (MDS) information. 

13.	The VA beneficiary will be provided nursing home care at the expense of VA for a period not in excess of that stated in the referral form, unless an extension of the authorization is provided in writing by the placing VA facility.
 
14.	The authorization agreement, VA Form 10-7078, for the affected Veteran will terminate whenever a VA beneficiary is hospitalized for 15 calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility.  A new authorization agreement will be required at the time the Veteran returns and is readmitted to the CNH.

15.	Level of Care Classification Effective Records:  The level of care classification and associated per   diem rate will remain in effect for each placement until and unless one of the following events takes place: 
15.1.  The VA beneficiary is discharged and subsequently qualifies for a new MDS admission assessment. 
15.2 The nursing home submits a new MDS assessment that documents a change in the level of care classification. The CNH RN Case Manager will also provide documentation regarding the level of care required by the Veteran and both assessments will be considered prior to a per diem rate change. 
15.3 The initial MDS will be provided to the VA upon the admission of a VA beneficiary and the er diem rate will be based upon that rating, the exception being the Rehabilitation ratings which are subject to VA written authorizations and time limitations.
15.4	The most recent MDS Section Z will be submitted monthly along with the invoices.

16.	VA beneficiaries admitted under contract for Respite Care will be weighed upon admission and again upon discharge. This information will be included with the invoice when submitted.

17.	The VA, at its sole option, will monitor the professional care and administrative management of services provided to VA beneficiaries under this agreement, through one or any combination of the following methods; reviews of state agencies reports, on-site review of the Nursing Home by VA staff, and/or on-site monitoring of VA patients.  It is agreed that the Nursing Home shall provide VA with copies of all state agency reports when requested, and cooperate fully with VA's quality improvement-quality assurance program functions relating to this agreement, including VA's on-site review and monitoring.  The VA Contracting Officer, (CO), along with the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative, (COTR), shall make all final determinations as to the contractor's reasonable cooperation with VA and compliance with these requirements.  It is understood that certain internal quality indicator/quality assurance information is not available for VA review.  Current quality measures and current individual MDS information will be made available.

18.	The CNH is responsible for complying with all the rules, policies and regulations expressed by the state in which they operate, (Pennsylvania), as they relate to nursing facilities providing 24 hours per day protective oversight to their residents. Therefore, if a Veteran is sent to an outpatient clinic appointment at the VA, (or admission exam in the VA Emergency Department), the CNH must assure that adequate oversight is provided during the trip to the VA and while the Veteran remains on the VA campus as an outpatient. This oversight may be provided by a family member, clergy person, volunteer or any other person who, in the judgment of the CNH, can responsibly and capably provide the Veteran with the necessary oversight and assistance with personal care needs. In the absence of any other person, the nursing facility shall send a staff member to assure protective oversight and assistance. When the Veteran is an outpatient on the VA campus, he is still considered a resident of the nursing facility and the nursing facility is thereby responsible to provide physical assistance and protective oversight. 

19.	Power of Attorney written consent must be obtained by the CNH prior to certain treatments in order for the VA to provide such treatment for VA beneficiaries deemed incompetent to provide informed consent. 

20.	VA reserves the right to send the Veteran back to the CNH without being seen if an escort is not provided, or a signed consent for treatment is needed and is not provided. 

21.	Expenses, (such as transportation costs), incurred by failure to comply will be deducted from the subsequent invoice.

   (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
 
     (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

 C.10  ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT
 
 This provision does not apply to ancillary services that may be added or deleted from the agreement.
 
 The per diem rate(s) will apply throughout the term of this contract, including extension period(s).  The rate(s) may be adjusted only to reflect a change in a Medicaid rate as authorized by the SMA.  Normally, this will be on an annual basis.  The negotiated percentage above the Medicaid rate, to cover the all inclusive nature of the contract, will not be renegotiated; but will be applied and added to the new Medicaid rate for the adjusted per diem rate for each level of care item.  This clause does not apply to rates for non Medicaid nursing homes. In this regard, new rates will be negotiated requiring a modification to the contract. Each per diem price adjustment under this clause is subject to the following limitations:
 
 Any adjustment shall be limited to the effect of increases or decreases in the approved SMA's patient care components within the affected Medicaid groups.
 
 Adjustments will occur no more frequently than those issued by the SMA.
 
 No adjustments will be made until the Contracting Officer receives an SMA authenticated copy of the new rate, signed and dated in a conspicuous area at the top right of the document by the authorized nursing home official.  Within ten days after this occurs, the Contracting Officer will execute an approval signature and date at the approximate location of the nursing home official's signature, the action of which will serve as the effective date of the adjusted rate.  A copy of the fully executed document will be sent to the nursing home official for record keeping purposes.
 
  
 C.11  TERMINATION OF SERVICES
 
 VA reserves the right to remove any or all VA patients from the nursing home at any time, when it is determined to be in the best interest of VA or the patients.
 
 C.12  PAYMENTS
 
 Payments made by VA under this contract constitute the total cost of nursing home care. No additional charges will be billed to Medicare Part B, the beneficiary or his/her family, either by the nursing home or any third part furnishing services or supplies required for such care, unless and until specific prior authorization in writing is obtained from the VA facility authorizing placement.  The contractor will not solicit contributions, donations, or gifts from patients or family members. Neither the VA nor the Veteran can be held liable to pay the nursing home or any third party furnishing services or supplies if the parties are on the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE) or Excluded Parties List System  (EPLS) lists.
 
 C.13  MINIMUM QUANTITIES
 
 It is impossible to determine the exact or estimated amount which will be expended under this contract. No obligation will be incurred by VA under this contract until authorizations are issued for nursing home care of specific beneficiaries. VA agrees to make payment on a timely basis for services rendered in accordance with such authorizations upon receipt of proper invoices submitted by the nursing home as outlined in Section E of this contract.  VA will make payment for the day a recipient enters the facility but not the day the recipient leaves a facility unless entrance and departure are on the same day then payment will be made for one day.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Solicitation number  HSCG38-11-Q-300060 is assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). 

The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51.

Description of the Requirement: Overhaul prices shall include all replacement parts required by the AFTO.  All replacement parts shall be new with traceability back to the OEM. The Coast Guard does not intend to provide replacement parts as Government Furnished Material in performance of the requirement.  The contractor shall be required to submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer once equipment has been received verifying the actual Part Numbers, NSNs and Serial Numbers on the equipment.  The information on the equipment should mirror the information on the Purchase Order.  The written notification shall identify any discrepancies between the equipment and the Purchase Order.  Equipment received that indicates obvious misuse, cannibalization or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage are considered exclusions and will be handled on a case-by-case basis.  Over and above work outside the direction of the AFO that is found during performance will be handled on a case-by-case basis.  High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the repair directive will not be considered as over-and-above.   In the event of exclusions or over-and-above work, the contractor will be required to submit an equipment condition report to the Contracting Officer detailing the finding and a listing of the additional parts and labor necessary to return the equipment to serviceable condition.    Non-reworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap.  Should equipment be determined Beyond Economical Repair (BER) the contractor shall provide written notification to the Contracting Officer of the BER condition and await disposition instructions.  The contractor will be entitled to a separate evaluation fee and scrap charge.  Packaging and Marking:  Packaging of the items for return shipment shall be in accordance with the contractors best commercial practices with the following exceptions:  Each item or unit must be individually packed in a separate box, carton or crate.  Each individual container shall be labeled on the outside with Purchase Order Number, Line Item Number, Nomenclature, Part Number, NSN, and Serial Number.  The internal packaging material shall be sufficient to prevent damage during shipping, handling and storage.  Preservation and protection shall be provided to prevent corrosion, deterioration or decay during warehouse storage for a period of one (1) year.  The USCG Aviation Logistics Center is a supply depot, therefore material will be stored and transshipped to various users.  The container shall be packed and labeled suitable for shipment via land, air or sea.  Packaging material shall NOT consist of popcorn material, shredded paper, Styrofoam of any type or peanut packaging.  Copies of packing slips shall be affixed to the outside of the shipping container.

The USCG does not own nor can it release the Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) necessary to perform the overhaul work.   The contractor must be able to obtain the AFTO including any applicable service bulletins.    The Ballscrew Assemblies are Flight Critical and serial number tracked.   The contractor must be able to provide a Certificate of Conformance or, if permitted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a certificate of airworthiness for each piece of equipment overhauled.   Offerors and any subcontractor to be used in performance of the required work shall be either OEM Certified or be an FAA Approved/Certified Repair Station.   Offerors are required to submit evidence of a valid OEM Certification or FAA Certification showing authorization to overhaul on the Ballescrew Assemblies.  Expired or pending certifications are not acceptable and will render an offerors quotation as not technically acceptable.    

The required Delivery time frame is no later than 45 days after receipt of the equipment.  Earlier deliveries are acceptable providing there is no additional cost to the Government.   Equipment shall be shipped to the USCG Aviation Logistics Center, Receiving Section Bldg 63, Weeksville Rd., Elizabeth City, NC 27909.  Inspection shall be performed by the USCG ALC Receiving Section for count and condition only and Acceptance shall be performed by USCG ALC Quality Assurance.  F.o.b. Destination quotes are preferred however an F.o.b. Origin, Freight Prepaid quote is acceptable.  F.o.b.

<p>COCO Alert 08-33 Attachment 1, Notice for Filing Agency Protests, is included with this solicitation.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Jun 2008)</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items. Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria:</p>
<p>Evaluation is based on the following criteria in descending order of importance:<br /><br />1. Price<br />2. Delivery<br />3. Past Performance (Relevant and recent)</p>
<p>Price is the most important evaluation factor, with Delivery being the second most important evaluation factor. Price and Delivery, when combined, are more important than Past Performance.</p>
<p>Price:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide pricing for requirement listed in this solicitation. Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section.</p>
<p>Delivery:</p>
<p>The offer must include information on lead time and F.O.B. information in accordance with the requirements in this solicitation. Offerors that can meet the government's required delivery date will be rated higher, with offerors that are able to deliver sooner than the required delivery date rated the highest.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>The offeror shall provide three (3) past performance references that reflect relevant experience performed within the past three (3) years. Relevant experience includes that which is similar in services provided. The following information shall be provided for each reference listed: Name of Contracting Activity, Contract Number, Contract Type, Contract Amount, Short Description of Work Performed, Contracting Officer and Telephone Number, Technical Point-of-Contact and Telephone Number. Offerors may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions.</p>
<p>Past performance will be evaluated for relevancy and recency. More relevant past performance will be rated higher with more recent, relevant past performance rated the highest.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating. The Government may also use other information available from Government sources to evaluate an offeror's past performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (APR 2011)</p>
<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p><br />All quotations submitted by responsible sources shall be considered by the Agency, if received timely. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is May 6, 2011, 4:00 p.m., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about May 13, 2011. E-mail quotes and facsimile quotes are acceptable. E-mail quotes may be sent to linda.j.stulick@uscg.mil or forwarded via to: fax number 252-334-5242 Attn: Linda J. Stulick. If submitted electronically, PLEASE indicate HSCG38-11-Q-500021 in subject line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The address for hard copy quotes should be submitted to:</p>
<p>USCG Aviation Logistics Center<br />Contracting Officer - HSCG38-11-Q-500021<br />Engineering Services Division (ESD)<br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909-5001</p>
<p>Award will be based on Best Value as defined in 52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items (Jan 1999). The government reserves the right to award to a higher priced quote, if deemed the overall best value to the government. Sources must have a valid Cage Code and DUNS number or the ability to obtain one, and also be registered in CCR (Central Contractor Registration) www.ccr.gov.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).<br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-11-R-P45RH9 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposals incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-45. This is a small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that the Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).

Description of requirements:

Unlike other ERG recording equipment, this piece of equipment is built for use on rodents (i.e., mice and rats).  Unlike humans, mice and rats vision are sensitive to UV light.  Other companies do not adapt their ERG recording equipment to the small heads of rodents, and as such their equipment is specifically made for human testing.  

Electroretinography (ERG) is an eye test used to detect abnormal function of the retina (the light-detecting portion of the eye). Specifically, in this test, the light-sensitive cells of the eye, the rods and cones, and their connecting ganglion cells in the retina are examined. During the test, an electrode is placed on the cornea (at the front of the eye) to measure the electrical responses to light of the cells that sense light in the retina at the back of the eye. These cells are called the rods and cones.

Item: D300 Console, Controller and amplifiers, this portion of the equipment is used collect data as a result of the visual stimulation.  It specifically interfaces with Item D125 below. 

Item: D125 - UV ColorDome, this piece of equipment provides a UV light source, in addition to blue and green lights.

Item: D192 - Rodent Table, this piece of equipment provides a table specifically made for rodents so that their entire head is surrounded by the light source.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer a question posed by a potential quoter.<br /><br />Q. Does independent selection and deposition mean that the controller shall be able to select only one material or more than one material at a time? Are you looking for a system that could deposit one, two, three, or four materials at a time?
<p>A. Only one material at a time is required, but the system shall be able to switch between materials without breaking vacuum and deposit using a common focal point. Switching time between sources should be &lt;1 minute from de-energizing one source to energizing another.</p>
<p>Q. Also, since the chamber is being manufactured separately and therefore we cannot test the system before delivery, will it be your responsibility to achieve those base pressures in your facility so long as we deliver a system consistent with achieving those base pressures?</p>
<p>A. The e-gun system shall be constructed of materials and in a design understood in the industry to be "UHV compatible" and an equivalent model shall have, in the manufacturer's test facility, been shown to reach 5 x 10^-11 Torr. In the event the manufacturer states compatibility using other techniques or designs than those uniformly established as "UHV compatible," then prior performance shall be demonstrated.</p>
<p>All other terms and conditions of the original solicitation, including closing date and time, remain unchanged and in full effect.</p>

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>Q. Has the NPS EMS billed for these services prior to this RFP?A. Yes
Q. If so, who is the current billing contractor?A. Dante Professionals
Q. The RFP states that they are 114 programs to be billed for, where are they located?A. These programs are located throughout the NPS Parks
Q. What are your rates for ALS1, ALS2, BLSE, ALS and BLS non-transports, and mileage?A. The NPS cannot release this requested information
Q. Do you charge for supplies? A. Charge for services
Q. If so what are their rates?A. None established.
Q. What is the average amount the NPS EMS charge per transport? A. Varies geographically, The NPS cannot release this requested information
Q. The RFP states under section 4.1.1 page 36 that completion and submission of Medicare and Medicaid provider enrollment applications as a task.  Is it safe to assume that the NPS has never billed the Medicare or Medicaid programs?A. NPS bills CMMS already
Q. If not and they have what are your Medicare and Medicaid allowed amounts?A. This information is not available
Q. On page 41 Specific Instructions Volume 1 - Price Proposal - subtasks 1.1.2 and 4.1.3 we are ask to propose a fee for Emergency Care-Facility billing.  What type of facility will the billing be for?A. Clinic (primary care and emergency care)
Q. Is it a facility that is approved and recognized by Medicare?A. Just coming on-line
Q. With regard to Volume II - Please clarify - All company reference must be removed even references normally made on in a cover letter.  Does this include location of Offeror?A. Any and all types company references and company information must be removed.
Q. Also to clarify - all volumes must be in separate binders or bound separately and all electronic copies must be on a separate disk or jump drive.A. Hard copy must be separated and not joined together, binders are not required so as long as the three volumes are not joined together. The soft copy documents can be on one flash drive so as long as they are three separate documents saved onto said drive.
Q. As I understand it Line Item Number (LIN) 0001 - Initial Program Establishment is where we would submit our price for the initial program establishment for the general NPS EMS Cost recovery Program.  This would be a one-time only fee.  Is this correct? A. YES one time for each EMS program
Q. LIN 0002 - Program Cost recovery Profile Establishment would be the set-up charge for each individual NPS entity we would contract with.  In other words if Park A contracted for services under this IDIQ they would pay this fee for the initial set up of their billing program.  When Park B contracted they would pay the same start up fee.  Is this correct?A. Yes
Q. Billing for subtask 4.1.1 Vendor shall propose for each patient care record processed, a rate of dollars per record this vendor shall charge the NPSEMS. Each proposed pricing shall be broken down via the following categories:A. BLS Transport Processing Fee  Please propose a fixed fee for processing per this type of recordALS Transport Processing Fee  Please propose a fixed fee for processing per this type of recordBLS Non-Transport Processing Fee  Please propose a fixed fee for processing per this type of recordALS Non-Transport Processing Fee  Please propose a fixed fee for processing per this type of recordEmergency Care - Facility Processing Fee Please propose a fixed fee for processing per this type of record
Q. LIN 0003 - Cost Recovery Billing is where we would quote our price as a rate of dollars per each type of record processed. (listed belowA. BLS Transport Processing Fee  Please propose a fixed fee for processing per this type of recordALS Transport Processing Fee  Please propose a fixed fee for processing per this type of recordBLS Non-Transport Processing Fee  Please propose a fixed fee for processing per this type of recordALS Non-Transport Processing Fee  Please propose a fixed fee for processing per this type of recordEmergency Care - Facility Processing Fee Please propose a fixed fee for processing per this type of record
Q. Would NPS EMS consider a billing pricing structure which combined a flat rate for each record processed along with a percentage of funds collected? A. The resulting contract shall be firm fixed price based on the fees charged per record and program establishment for each task order issued under said IDIQ.  The NPS will not be considering a mix of fixed fees and percentage of funds collected.
Q. Is this a new program and if not, who is the incumbent contractor? A. At this time Dante Professionals is performing EMS Recovery Services for the NPS.

Q. The PWS references "EMS programs treat an average of 16,000patients annually through a system of 114 programs." Does NPS EMS provide 16,000 ambulance/patient transport event search year or does the 16,000 reflect all medical events-reimbursableor otherwise? A. NO, NPS Treats 16000 patients a year

Q. For example, would a patient provided with simple FirstAid by an unlicensed NPSemployee be counted as one of the 16,000 patients or are there an estimated 16,000 patients provided with reimbursable medical care each year?A. NO, only EMS calls, the 16000 number does not include first aid.

Q. Can the National Park Service provide statistics on the following to help define the potential scope of work:A. a.Number of ground ambulances operated. 47b.Number of fixed wing or rotary wing air ambulances operated. Nonec.Number of physicians employed/contracted. 1d.Number of physician assistants or nurse practitioners employed/contracted. 2e.Number of EMT staff employed/contracted.  2000
Q. Under Task 4.1.1. Initial Program Establishment, the key startup activity will be to get NPS EMS ambulance services, facilities and practitioners credentialed and contracted with Medicare,Medicaid and other commercial payers as directed by NPS. Each payer will have their own unique credentialing requirement and the credentialing/contracting process could span many months with each payer with no ultimate guarantee of being included into a payer's network. It is impossible to propose a fixed fee for this task without volume assumptions from NPS on how many ambulance services, facilities and practitioners need to be credentialed and how many insurance programs does NPS desire to attempt to contract with. Could NPS please provide these statistics as assumptions for our fixed fee quotation?A. As this an evolving program in its early stages the NPS does not have this type of information available. 
Q. Under Task 4.1.2. Program Cost Recovery Profile Establishment:Has NPS contracted with emsCharts to implement a standard interface to support billing such as a HL7 DFT interface?A. emsCharts has a billing export module that is industry standard
Q. Are all of the patient records stored in a centralized emsCharts database for all of NPS?A. Yes
Q. Will the contractor be provided with online access to emsCharts for coding and claims preparation. A. Yes
Q. If not, will NPS provide the contractor with a copy of all documentation for a patient in emsCharts in a PDF or XML document? A. N/A
Q. Will the contractor be expected to develop the electronic extract of data from emsCharts or is this being provided by emsCharts or NPS? A. The NPS will give to the contractor access to the billing export module
Q. The amount of Coordination of Benefit activity will vary dramatically from patient to patient based on the patient's insurance coverages. It will be difficult to anticipate the amount of payer follow up work required on each patient case-especially if NPS EMS is out-of-network for most payers. Would NPS consider changing the quotation metricfrom "each patient care record processed" to "each claim or bill submitted"? A. NPS will determine which ePCR will be submitted for billing upon closeout of case record.
Q .If NPS is willing to change the quotation metric for this task to "each claim or bill submitted",we would recommend asking contractors to propose a per claim or per bill rate based on the following categories: A.  No reply, not a question.
Q .It does not make sense to propose per "patient care record" prices based on the level and type of care (e.g. "ALS" vs. "BLS") as the coding and billing effort is essentially the same for the contractor for each patient care record. The clinical documentation in emsCharts will drive the level and type of care that the contractor seeks reimbursement for. Asking for pricing based on the type of bill/claim generated may be a better metric and may better reflect differences in the level of effort for the contractor. A. No reply, not a question.
Q. Will the contractor be expected to make accounting entries directly into the NPS account receivable (A/R) system as indicated in the PWS "Track/Post all accounting items"? A. NO 
Q. If so, can the contractor be compensated for the training time required for its staff on the NPS A/R system? A. N/A
Q.Does the NPS have existing relationships with collection agencies that the contractor can leverage?A. NO 
Q. Many states require that a collection agency be licensed by the state. Most collection agencies operate on a contingent percentage of revenues collected. If the contractor is expected to subcontract with a collection agency, it would be difficult to try to predict and blend these costs into a per bill or per patient fixed amount. A. No reply, not a question.
Q.Under Task 4.1.4 Payment Structure:  Does NPS require that all of the payments be made via check or will each NPS program be able to accept EFT/ACH electronic payments as well? A. NPS Can take credit cards. EFT and ACH is being developed with CMMS.
Q.Most payers may not support different addresses for EOB mailings versus check payment mailings. Thus, we're assuming that all EOBs and checks need to be mailed to the contractor first and then the contractor will then mail the checks to each NPS program for deposit. Will the contractor have access to NPS mail and courier accounts? A. NO 
Q. If not, can the contractor be reimbursed for these costs as an ODC? A.  These costs should be built into charges to process
Q.Will there be an option to accept credit card payments for patient responsibility amounts which is documented to increase the collection rate and timeliness for small balances and will help reduce the amount of returned check processing required by NPS and the contractor? A. YES

<p>A. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors' initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>B. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Approach - Offeror will be evaluated based upon the demonstrated ability to effectively and efficiently perform the work specified in the statement of work. The approach must demonstrate how each task in the statement of work will be accomplished. This includes information on how the work will be organized and the capability of the offeror. The approach should reflect a clear understanding of the work under this requirement.</p>
<p>2. Personnel- Demonstrated experience, capability and availability of all proposed key personnel, including any consultants or subcontractors.</p>
<p>3. Past Performance: The offeror's demonstrated record, as confirmed by references, of successful past performance of the same or substantially similar contract efforts including quality of services or supplies, timeliness of performance and delivery, cost control and the offeror's business relations.</p>
<p>Sources (i.e. Government databases or other individuals) other than those identified in the offeror's proposal may be contacted/accessed by the Government. The Government may use the additional information received in its evaluation of the offeror's past performance and responsibility determination.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than the cost or price. Although the proposed cost or price is not listed as an evaluation factor, it shall be considered a significant criterion in the overall evaluation of proposals. The factors listed above are in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>C. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>If needed, the Government intends to exercise the option or options under FAR 52.217-8 without further competition or need for justification for other than full or open competition [or limited source justification or sole source justification]. For purposes of evaluation, the potential need to exercise the option under FAR 52.217-8 to extend the period of contract performance for the maximum period of six (6) months beyond the last option period will be considered the same for all offerors. In considering the price of the base period and any option periods, the Government will consider that if the extension of service clause (FAR 52.217-8) is exercised, it will be on the exact same rates and terms, other than length of performance, as the base or option period being extended. The Government will determine whether the price, inclusive of all options (including the options available under FAR 52.217-8), is fair and reasonable, and whether the price of the base period and all option periods (including the option(s) represented by FAR 52.217-8), in combination with the other evaluation factors specified in the solicitation, represents the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>D. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>COCO Alert 08-33 Attachment 1, Notice for Filing Agency Protests, is included with this solicitation.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAIABLE AT THIS TIME. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT OBLIGATED TO AND WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM POTENTIAL SOURCES AS A RESULT OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT.<br /><br />The 633d Contracting Squadron, Langley AFB, Virginia is seeking the interest of potential and eligible contractors for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) roof repair, maintenance, alteration, and replacement contract. This is a Sources Sought announcement; a market survey for written information only. This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources interested in providing work which includes all materials, labor, tools, equipment, transportation, supervision, management and other services necessary to accomplish non-complex minor construction, maintenance, repair and renovation work on real property with minimum design requirements at Langley AFB, Fort Eustis and surrounding federal installations.
<p>The 633d Air Base Wing is seeking those firms with a demonstrated history of relevant construction experience where the primary focus is on IDIQ-type contracts with simultaneous performance of multiple projects at differing locations similar to the task order value that will be executed under this contract. Every task order will be competed. The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is between $10M and $25M. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this effort is 238160 (Roofing Contractors) and the Small Business Size Standard $14M. The description of work will be identified in each individual task order. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period with four 12-month option periods. Performance and payment bonds will be required per individual delivery order in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 28.</p>
<p>Potential offerors are encouraged to monitor the FedBizOpps website for program documents. Firms responding to this sources sought notice must (1) state whether they are small or large business based on the size standard above; if applicable, identify subcontractors to be used and their anticipated responsibilities; (2) indicate all of the following small business status categories that apply: Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), 8(a) firm, HUB Zone firm, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Historically Black College and University or Minority Institution (HBVU/MI); (3) provide experience in the form of an outline of previous projects for specific relevant work completed or currently being performed of equivalent magnitude including contract numbers, description of work, points of contact, and phone numbers; professional qualifications and specific experience of personnel identified to perform the work; and (4) provide any other pertinent information which would enable the government to assess the capabilities of a firm. Because the Government reserves the right to set this acquisition aside for small business, 8(a) firms, HUB Zone firms or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business based on the responses it receives, it is imperative that firms respond with the required information for capabilities to be accurately evaluated. Potential offerors should limit their responses to ten (10) pages (single spaced, 12 pt font). All information included in offeror responses should be specific to this Sources Sought synopsis.</p>
<p>Responses to this Sources Sought announcement are due NLT 17 June 2010 by 5:00 PM EST. Late responses will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice only.
<p>March 23, 2010, the President enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L., 111-148). Subsequently, March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 was enacted; combined, these two pieces of legislation are referred to as the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act includes a variety of provisions designed to expand health care coverage, provide increased health care choices and enhance the quality of health care provided to the American population.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovations (CMMI) is a leader is a Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)-wide initiative implement many of the Affordable Care Act provisions. This sources sought notice is in relation to the testing of healthcare models ultimately designed to increase the quality of health care and the reduction of harm in our beneficiary population. A part of this overall effort is a focus on the Partnership for Patients Initiative (PPI). PPI is a priority project designed to reduce hospital inpatient harm by 40% and readmissions by 20% over a 3 year period.</p>
<p>Through coordinated efforts with industry and experts in the field of medicine, CMS/CMMI believes that a model combining large learning networks aimed at rapidly studying, and providing time-sensitive information to health care delivery providers is the best methodology for bringing about rapid change. In support of the PPI, CMMI will engage the hospital, provider and broader care-giver communities to quickly implement well-tested and measured best practices; the end result of the overall initiative is the anticipated reduction in hospital-based harm and preventable readmissions for our beneficiary population. Under this initiative, CMS intends to solicit and award multiple contracts to qualified vendors/contractors to support the PPI through education, collaboration and engagement of the first line hospitals involved in beneficiary care; all of the work of the vendors under this requirement should result in long-term reductions in hospital-based harm and unnecessary readmissions of the beneficiary population. The vendors under this requirement will be referred to as Hospital Engagement Contractors (HECs).</p>
<p>Under this sources sought, CMS is interested in conducting market research to determine if small businesses can meet any of the mandatory requirements to be able to successfully meet the terms and conditions of the forthcoming procurement. The model approved for the implementation of this activity calls for the direct contracting with hospitals and organizations that fulfill the following organizational requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Organizations that are national, regional, or state association of hospitals as identified through an organizational charter or agreement and a governing body that represents affiliated members. (e.g. state hospital associations)</p>
<p>&bull; Organizations that functions as national affinity organization that represents hospitals which address specific patient and/or regional health issues identified through an organizational charter or agreement and a governing body that represents affiliated members.</p>
<p>&bull; Organizations that hold corporate ownership and operational control of a hospital chain of at least 25 hospitals.</p>
<p>Entities able to successfully complete the requirements of the upcoming contract would have to demonstrate in the affirmative they have the at least one of the above qualifications including having existing relationships with large numbers of hospitals, and demonstrated ability to engage all hospitals that accept Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP beneficiaries in major educational campaigns. Additionally, these organizations must demonstrate the existing capacity to collect, track, and monitor hospital quality data and systems in place to support such activities relative to hospitals slated to participate in Partnership for Patients.</p>
<p>Capability statements may be provided as follows:</p>
<p>No more than 5 pages to demonstrate the organization's existing relationships as defined in the three bullets above and a description of the qualifications regarding the vendor's ability to effectively engage hospitals in order to achieve reductions in inpatient harm by 40% and readmissions by 20% over a 3 year period.</p>
<p>Information shall be electronically submitted to the following address: <a href="mailto:joseph.eakle@cms.hhs.gov">joseph.eakle@cms.hhs.gov</a> and no later than June 8, 2010 9 am (local time, Baltimore, MD). Information shall be provided in narrative form in MicrosoftWord.</p>
<p>Capability statements will be reviewed assessed prior the government issuing the final presolicitation notice. The government will not be responding to vendors in relation to information received and vendors are advised to not share proprietary information in response to this capability statement. Vendors are advised that the issuance of this notice does not obligate the government to cover any costs for submission in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by CMS not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within discretion of the government.</p>

<a href="mailto:jacqueline.haralson@faa.gov">jacqueline.haralson@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning data to supplement weather observations at all FAA-owned automated weather stations (Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) and Automated Weather Sensor System (AWSS)).  Lightning data is delivered through an Internet Protocol (IP) and received at an ASOS/AWOS Data Acquisition System (ADAS).  The ADAS then sends data in latitude/longitude pairs with a time stamp, intensity, polarity and quality factor in binary form.  An ADAS module, the Automated Lightning Detection and Reporting System (ALDARS), takes the FAA reformatted data package and distributes the information to the appropriate FAA-owned automated weather systems.  The FAA also uses the lightning data for Integrated terminal Weather Systems (ITWS), Corridor Integrated Weather Systems (CIWS) and research & development (R&D) organizations within the FAA.  The end-users for the lightning data are pilots and air traffic controllers. The FAA requirements include CG lightning data from Zone 1 (CONUS), Zone 2 (Alaska) and Zone 3 (Hawaii).
The period of performance is anticipated to be for one (1) base year and four (4) option years.  In the base year, the lightning data must be delivered as a continuous feed, 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, via internet protocol (IP), and during the four (4) option years the lightning data must be delivered via T1 line as the primary method and IP as the secondary [back-up] method. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code has been identified as "518210, Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services".  FAA will consider vendor suggestions for use of other NAICS codes consistent with the areas of interest described above. 
The FAA is surveying the market to seek potential vendors capable of meeting technical and delivery requirements for CG lightning data in Zones 1, 2 and 3. The acquisition strategy for this procurement has not been determined at this time.  However, either a full and open competition or a set-aside in all or in part for small businesses, service disabled veteran owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses certified by the SBA for participation in the 8(a) program will be chosen depending on the responses to the market survey. This market survey is to provide information to the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition and to determine if adequate competition exists. The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate Small Business Office 8(a) and other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.  
The FAA requires copies of certification letters for interested service disabled veteran owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.
Any vendor capable of providing lightning data is invited to submit a statement of capabilities addressing its abilities to meet the FAA's requirements.  The statement of capabilities must include, but is not limited to, the following parameters for Zones 1, 2 & 3:  horizontal resolution, location accuracy, reporting frequency, data latency, detection efficiency, probability of false detection, reliability, timing accuracy, polarity, peak current, flash multiplicity and archiving capabilities. 
The following attachments are part of this Market Survey:Attachment A:  Draft Statement of WorkAttachment B:  Business Declaration Form
This is not a Screening for Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposal (RFP) of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking, or accepting, any unsolicited proposals.  This market survey is for informational purposes only, and this announcement is not intended to guarantee a procurement of services and must not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract. The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries or responses to this announcement and will not reimburse any costs for responding to this market survey.  Any costs associated with the market survey submittal are solely at the interested vendor's expense. Responses will not be returned, and the FAA will not pay for any information received.
No solicitation exists at this time.  If one is issued, it will be announced on the FAA Contracting Opportunities Website.  It is each vendor's responsibility to monitor the site for release of a solicitation.  
If interested and capable of meeting the requirements, please submit Statements of Capabilities, Business Declaration Forms and comments to the draft Statement of Work by 5:00PM EST on June 30, 2011 to Jacqueline Haralson, Contract Specialist at Jacqueline.haralson@faa..gov.  Include the company's point of contact, including telephone, fax and email address.  It is preferred this information be provided on company letterhead.  The Statement of Capabilities response is limited to no ten (10) pages using 11 pt font on single space, one sided paper.  Contact Jacqueline Haralson at (202)267-3612 if you have any questions.

<DESC>The work includes the construction of an approximately 720 foot earth channel between the end of an existing concrete box culvert and Kennedy Avenue, including demolition of miscellaneous features, clearing and grubbing, constructing new steel channel walls and anchorages adjacent to the existing box culvert, earthwork for the channel, deep soil mixing, and stone channel base material. An existing 90-inch diameter sanitary effluent outfall main is to be relocated, while remaining active; including the use of pile supported temporary and permanent piping. The work also includes construction vibration monitoring and control, site drainage, pavements, fencing, pile tests and incidental related work.<br>The project work occurs in three general phases. The objective of Phase 1, Exploratory Excavation and Preparation, is to locate and document the existing outfall main so that a new relocated main can be accurately constructed. Work in this phase includes: clearing and grubbing along with degrading portions of the site; cutting off flows of surface water into the site by plugging the existing box culvert near one end of the work area and building an earthen berm near the other end; determining precise location and elevations of the existing outfall main; and installing a cofferdam and bracing system along with protective measures adjacent to the outfall main. In Phase 2, Sanitary Outfall Main Relocation, the objective is to construct a new main along an alignment below the new channel while keeping effluent flows continuous. Work in this phase includes: providing a temporary bypass main including taps, line stopping and diverting flows to the bypass main; demolishing portions of the existing main and constructing a permanent main following the new profile below the channel; deep soil mixing and backfilling of areas adjacent to the permanent main; diverting flows to the permanent main; and removal of the bypass main. Phase 3, Slope Stabilization and Finishing, involves performing the remaining work activities for a complete and functional project. Work in this phase includes: additional deep soil mixing for stabilization of the new channel; providing the wing walls and anchorage system at the end of the existing box culvert; constructing the new earthen channel with stone channel base material; removing portions of the cofferdam; constructing local drainage features, pavements, and fencing; removing the temporary earth berm and box culvert plug; and miscellaneous construction and closeout activities. The estimated period of performance is 730 calendar days after receipt of the Notice to Proceed. Magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00. PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. Proposal will be evaluated on Technical Merit, Past Performance, Small Business Participation, and Price. THIS IS AN UNRESTRICTED ACQUISITION.
