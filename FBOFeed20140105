* The need exists to update the system hardware and has specified a requirement to shrink the size and form factgor of the existing outdated hardware to smaller and modular components for flexibility in low power and space limited configurations all the while duplicating identical system functionality.  In the previous Earthworm configuration seismic waveform data acquisition, flow control and management was accomplished with a 19" rack mounted Pentium 4 single processor computer.  In the newer Cellworm/Networm system this function and requirement must be duplicated to insure system continuity and minimize development and associated costs yet still meet the size and power specifications. The Networm is designed around a 12volt DC battery system for emergency backup requirements, so fanless is mandatory as well as minimizing/eliminating any other compute or I/O options outside other requirements listed., 116, EA; <BR><span class="label">LI 002: </span>SHIPPING TO MENLO PARK, CA, 1, EA; <BR> <BR><a href="https://marketplace.fedbid.com/fbweb/fbobuyDetails.do?token=%3D%3DwBKxmaVGYR92V7xTgY0tOcQAAAAAHeAAgAgTFCGg%2FFzzqQbJAAyVXBA0Or">Solicitation and Buy Attachments </a> <BR> <BR>***Question Submission: Interested offerors must submit any questions concerning the solicitation at the earliest time possible to enable the Buyer to respond.
