<DESC>116-N-1 CRIB REMEDIATION DESIGN


Note:  This Subcontract will be set aside for award to Small Business firms only. Potential Offerors will be required to certify as a Small Business as defined by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 562910 for work of Environmental Remediation Services (Ref: http://www.sba.gov/size/sizetable2002.html)

The 116-N-1 treatment, storage, and disposal (TSD) unit operated from 1963 to 1985 as the primary liquid waste disposal facility for the N Reactor at the Hanford Site.  The crib, which is a distinct part of the 116-N-1 TSD unit, received radiologically contaminated water from various reactor facilities.  The effluent contained activation and fission products, as well as small quantities of corrosive liquids and laboratory chemicals.  A total of ten pipelines discharge into the crib.  The crib area is approximately 110 m long by 38 m wide.  A sloped soil and gravel embankment forms the walls of the crib.  Initially, the bottom of the crib was filled with a 0.9-m layer of large boulders.  An additional 0.6-m layer of smaller boulders was added to the top of the large boulders to cover surface contamination associated with those large boulders.  In 1988 the entire crib was covered with cobble-sized material.  Consequently, the depth of rocks and boulders may vary throughout the crib from 2.1 m to 3.4 m. 

The 116-N-1 crib material is considered to be Low Level Radioactive Waste, but Mixed Low Level Waste may be encountered.  Radiation dose rates from the large boulders have been measured as high as 600 mR/hr.  

During sample line installation on the west side of the crib in 1974, radioactive effluent was inadvertently discharged to the soil.  Although contaminated soil was removed, some residual contamination still remains at the site, which is identified as UPR-100-N-31.  

The scope of this subcontract includes all activities necessary to prepare a design for the excavation, removal, and load out of radioactively contaminated materials and associated pipelines from the 116-N-1 Crib and UPR-100-N-31 waste sites, while keeping dose to workers as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).  These activities include design coordination meetings, a feasibility study, site inspections and data gathering, design presentations, and one design revision cycle based on client comments.

The design must successfully integrate with requirements of other ongoing operations at the Hanford Site, to include transportation and disposal of wastes remediated from the 116-N-1 TSD unit.  The successful bidder will develop a materials handling plan, consistent with ongoing transportation and disposal activities.  The materials handling plan is anticipated to be approximately 10-20 pages in length, will include a graphic depiction, and will address, at a minimum, the following:
„h general sequence
„h radiological shielding requirements
„h excavation methods
„h control of fugitive air emissions
„h loading and acceptance of waste containers
„h transfer of waste containers to a survey station
„h staging of waste containers for transport by others 
„h consideration of over-the-road transportation requirements, and 
„h consideration of container off-loading and disposition at the Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility located elsewhere on the Hanford Site.

In addition to a materials handling plan, the successful bidder will prepare drawings and technical specifications required to support implementation of remedial action at the sites.  The drawings and specifications must be of sufficient detail that remediation subcontract procurement packages can be directly prepared utilizing them.  Design drawings and specifications must be sealed, signed, and dated by a registered professional engineer of the appropriate discipline.  Bechtel Hanford, Inc. (BHI) will provide existing drawings and specifications for information. 

Potential bidders will be required to be pre-qualified by BHI.  A Pre-Qualification Questionnaire will be available on this web site on or about February 21, 2003.  A job site walkdown will be required for potential bidders.  Participants must be able to meet applicable DOE requirements for site access.

The estimated subcontract value is between $200,000 and $300,000.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for annual maintenance services for two Government-owned Phillips CM200ST and EM420 Transmission Electron Microscopes.  Items covered are two routine preventive maintenance service calls per year plus unlimited emergency visits at no additional charge, labor, travel, living expenses and major parts coverage.  Period of performance for this service will be for a period not less than one (1) year with an option to extend the period of performance for one (1) additional year. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from  FEI/Phillips Electron as the only known responsible source who can meet Agency requirements.  There are no other sources that have access to complete design drawings needed for servicing the complex electronic instruments.  Phillips Electron is the manufacturer of the equipment.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to become familiar enough to maintenance the equipment and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 24, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTE: This modification is to change the POC from Alice Watson to Laura Smith.

NOTICE:  This procurement is 100% set-aside for 8(a).  In accordance with 13 CFR 124.507(c) (2), the Small Business Administration (SBA) may limit 8(a) competition to participants having a bona fide place of business within the geographical boundaries of Arizona, Los Angeles, Nevada, New Mexico, Santa Ana, and San Diego District Offices.  It appears that the majority of the work will be performed in California, therefore, SBA may consider limiting competition to contractors located in Fresno, Los Angeles, Santa Ana, San Diego, San Francisco, California and Arizona.  Competition is limited to participants in the developmental and/or transitional stage who have never received an 8(a) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC).  Firms shall be licensed/bonded and capable to perform construction work under the NAICS Code 233.  Firms wishing to submit a proposal in response to this solicitation must first submit a Letter of Intent to SWDIVNAVFACENGCOM, Attn: Alice Watson, Code 02R3, 1220 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA  92132-5190 no later than 4:00 p.m. 31 January 2002.  The following information must be included in the Letter of Intent: Company name, a positive statement of your intent to submit a proposal for this solicitation as a prime contractor, point of contact, phone number, email address, and your SBA servicing office.  Only those firms responding to this announcement by 4:00 p.m. 31 January 2002 will be considered and no additional firms will be added.  SBA, Business Opportunity Specialist assigned to the 8(a) participant will determine whether or not the a firm is eligible to propose based on the eligibility criteria prescribed in 13 CFR 124.507.  Eligibility is based on 8(a) BD program criteria, including whether the Participant is:  (i) A small business under the NAICS/SIC code assigned to the requirement; and (ii) A concern with a bona fide place of business in the applicable geographic area if the procurement is for construction.  The respective SBA district office representatives will determine whether or not a firm is eligible to submit a proposal in response to the solicitation.  All firms will be notified accordingly.  This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts to the responsible proposer(s) whose proposal(s), conforming to the Request for Proposal(s), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered.  AWARD MAY BE MADE TO A FIRM OTHER THAN THE ONE SUBMITTING THE LOWEST PRICE.  ADDITIONALLY, IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS.  THEREFORE, THE OFFEROR'S INITIAL PROPOSAL SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFEROR'S BEST TERMS FROM A COST OR PRICE AND TECHNICAL STANDPOINT.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation falls under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 233.  The annual size standard is $27.5 million.  This is an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his/her properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor(s).  Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, design-build for new construction, renovation/revitalization/alteration and repair and associated work at various locations within Arizona, California, Nevada, and New Mexico.  However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in California.  Types of work/projects may include, but is not limited to:  administrative and industrial facilities, whole house revitalization, child care centers, lodges, recreation/fitness centers, retail complexes, warehouses, housing offices, community centers, commercial and institutional building construction, manufacturing and industrial building construction, and other similar facilities.  In support of design-build strategies, each offeror shall employ the services of an architect/engineering design firm experienced in the coordination of multi-discipline architectural/engineering design efforts in all aspects of new and renovation of various types of facilities.  The Government shall not coordinate the work for the Contractor.  Offerors may offer multiple lead design firms to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  The Offeror and the Lead Design Firm(s) proposed for the basic contract will be evaluated as a team.  Lead Design Firm(s) (A/Es), their subsidiaries and affiliates that were involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project may not be proposed or used on a task order for that project.  Award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order, and may be competed on the basis of price, best value, or technically acceptable low price.  Task orders may be performance oriented requiring minimal design, may occasionally be complex construction requiring design development for design-build construction or a combination of both.  Task orders may not have traditional plans and specifications, but may include sketches, and request for catalog cuts, and other submittals.  In order to develop a mutually agreed upon Statement of Work, the salient requirements of the task order, will be scoped by the Government/Contractor Team.  The awarded task order will be a performance scoped, firm fixed price task order with a specific completion date.   Should any of the IDIQ Contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded a task order.  If a contractor selects not to attend a site visit and submit a proposal, the contractor shall provide written notification to the Contracting Officer within two days, of receipt of either a written or oral scope of work.  The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, is $30,000,000 for each contract awarded under this solicitation.  The one time minimum guarantee is $25,000.  The task order range is estimated at $500,000 - $3,000,000.  Individual task orders/projects may also require incorporation of sustainable design features. The basic contract is for twelve months (or earlier as determined by the Contracting Officer after the contract maximum amount of $30,000,000 per contractor is ordered by the Government).  The contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total duration of 60 months or a value of $30 million per contractor, whichever occurs first.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following criteria as defined in the RFP: (1) Past performance of the Offeror's Team; (2) Technical Experience of Offeror's Team; and (3) Price will be based on all labor, materials and equipment necessary to add ventilation for a total of 36 separate welding booths to an existing building and incidental related work.  This work involves the replacement of two existing supply air handling units located on the roof with two new larger supply air handling units and two new exhaust fans. The proposed task order also includes fluorescent light fixtures, conduit and wiring.  This project is separated into two identical Parts, Part A, and Part B, located within the same building.  Each part contains 18 separate welding booths and an existing supply air-handling unit.  The Government reserves the right not to award proposed Task Order 0001.  Proposed Task Order 0001 may or may not be awarded through this contract or any other contract.  Also, the Government reserves the right to award only one contract covering, proposed Task Order 0001.  The Government, further, reserves the right, with sole discretion, subject to the availability of funds, to award proposed Task Order 0001 within 120 calendar days after Contract Award to the offeror submitting the best value proposal in response to the solicitation.  A pre-proposal conference will held in San Diego.  Date and time to be established.  No site visit will be held.  This solicitation will be offered in electronic format only to those firms determined by SBA to be eligible.  No hard copies will be provided.  All offerors shall be registered in the Central Contractors Register (CCR) prior to award of a DoD contract.

Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) requires all states to develop and implement TMDL for their impaired water bodies and water bodies threatened to become impaired. While considerable improvements have been achieved in reducing the amount of point source pollution from factories and municipalities being discharged into U.S. waters, over 40 percent of the Nation's water bodies remain impaired, in that they do not meet water quality standards for their designated use (USEPA 1996). Much of this is attributed to agricultural drainage and other diffuse-source pollution (NPSP) whose control is difficult because the source areas can be hard to identify and typical treatment methods are infeasible due to the distributed nature of the pollutants. Hydrologic, transport and fate models simulate cause-and-effect relationship and offer an effective alternative for quantifying potential benefits of planned restorations of disturbed watersheds and evaluating the efficacy BMPs. The objectives of this contract will be to provide a review document that: (1) evaluates watershed hydrologic/hydrodynamic and water quality models that can be used by states for developing and implementing TMDL for sediments, nutrients, and toxins; and (2) identify areas in which further research and development could improve the performance and usability of currently used models.  The RFP shall be competed on a full and open basis and the EPA anticipates the award of a firm fixed price type contract.  Solicitation No. PR-CI-03-10115 is expected to be issued approximately March 2003 and close 30 days thereafter. It will be available on the internet at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and subsequent amendments from the given web site.  Hard copies will only be issued on a limited basis to those eligible firms without internet access.  Request for hard copies shall be mailed, faxed or e-mail to the POC.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to frequently check the site for any amendments.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the EPA.

<DESC>NA By way of this announcement, the Chicago District - U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is seeking sources to locate firms who are capable of designing and installing a micro-pulsed DC electric array, which will form the basis for a barrier intended to deter the dispersal of aquatic organisms.  This is not a Request for Proposals.  Minimum capabilities must include documented evidence of experience and expertise.  Firms with capabilities to perform the work listed below should submit complete information to the Ch icago District - USACE, 111 North Canal Street, Suite 600, ATTN: Regina Blair (Contracting Office), Chicago, IL 60606. The information should be submitted in triplicate within ten days from the date of this announcement.  Information should include: (1) th e number and professional qualifications of scientists, engineers, technical and other appropriate personnel; (2) company experience related to the proposed project; (3) a description of general and special facilities; (4) any other literature which demons trates minimum designer capabilities to perform the effectiveness of the electric dispersal barrier to repel fish in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal across all seasons, in a variety of flow regimes and across the range of electrical output generated by  the barrier; (5) submit the names and locations of current operating fish barrier facilities designed, installed and operated by your firm as well as including subcontractors (mechanical, electrical, structural, and etc.) experienced as evidence of experi ence and expertise.  This work will include but not limited to monitoring the movement of both pelagic and benthic fish species, tagging fish using PIT tags just after the barrier becomes operational and tag recaptures monthly thereafter.  Sampling must be  done both above and below the dispersal barrier at 1-km intervals.  The information must be recorded (identification number of each fish, species, length, point of capture, point of recapture, etc.) in the field on a laptop computer, with periodic paper p rintouts to back up the electronic files.  The barrier must cope with the highly variable flow in the canal between 2,000 to 20,000 cfs.  The barrier and appurtenant apparatus must not interfere with navigation nor can it affect the wastewater discharge. Coordination is required with the barrier construction contractor test the barrier’s effectiveness at varying levels of the electric field.  Fish must be marked and sampled for recaptures at least twice following any changes in the barrier operation.
