<CONTACT>Leslie Corpening Contract Specialist 8015243613     lcorpening@uc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is issuing a solicitation for the purpose of requesting proposals for the San Juan River Recovery Implementation Program (SJRIP).  It is the Government's intent to award a one-year contract, without discussions.  However, if negotiations are needed, the negotiations will be held on or about May 22, 2007.  Since the majority of this work will occur on Navajo Nation lands, all offerors must obtain all necessary permits and permissions from the Navajo Nation and provide evidence of this with their proposals.  The SJRIP's goal is to allow water development to continue according to state and Federal laws while recovering two endangered fish species: the Colorado pikeminnow and razorback sucker.  The work to be performed is:  monitor water temperature at 8 different locations in the San Juan River, NM and UT; create a database of water temperatures that can be posted and accessed at the SJRIP website; using seven general habitat categories and 27 sub-types of habitat yearly map aquatic habitat at a scale of 1" = 200', digital video files for the entire San Juan river will be provided to the contractor by Reclamation; examine the relationships between hydrology (especially recent antecedent hydrology conditions) and habitat conditions throughout the river, especially backwater habitats and habitat complexity; create detailed maps for two, 0.75 mile reaches at a scale of 1" = 75', develop a  two-dimensional steady-state model of the hydrologic processes involved in forming and maintaining the two reaches.  These two reaches have been identified by previous Recovery Program studies as representative of complex reaches throughout the river that are important to endangered fish species.  Determine long-term change in river floodplain cross sections at 14 key locations and compare the relationship of this change to antecedent hydrology.  The survey frequency for the 14 locations is 5 years with the next survey due in 2009 following runoff.  This work is a continuation of a long-term monitoring effort.  Surveys should be conducted at a scale to provide comparisons with data collected previously; use the data collected through habitat mapping to better define the relationships between hydrology and channel morphology and habitat in response to both river stage and antecedent conditions.  The work is located at monitoring sites in the San Juan and Animas Rivers.  The work will be performed under NAICS Code 541710.  The contract will be firm-fixed price.  Approximate date of solicitation issuance is April 10, 2007.   Prospective vendors must register in CCR prior to the award of a contract.  Information, Central Contractor Registration Handbook and the registration process can be obtained via the CCR web site, http://www.ccr.gov. or by calling 1-888-227-2423.

GSA is interested in considering alternative space if relocation is economically advantageous to the Government.  The agency will require an additional 4,000 rentable square feet for a total of approximately 37,405 rentable square feet.  In making such a determination, GSA will consider cost factors including, but not limited to, the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and anticipated rent for the space.  Of particular importance is space configuration to support a sophisticated IT infrastructure.  Proximity to employee services, such as moderately priced restaurants, banks, public transportation, and a fitness center, as well as hotel accommodations for visitors is also necessary.  Other factors impacting the Government?s rights under a prospective lease, such as the length of any firm term that may be required at an alternative location, length of time necessary to deliver occupancy-ready space, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term, will also bear.

Space must be located in Lakewood, Colorado and within these boundaries:  North-Highway 285; South-West Marshall Avenue, East-S. Pierce St.; and West-Wadsworth Blvd.  Space must meet the Federal Government's standards for fire safety, be capable of being fully accessible to the physically challenged, and be located outside a 100-year floodplain.  Space must be ready for occupancy on July 1, 2007 or sooner.  A lease term of 10 years with a firm term of 5 years is sought.  

Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building?s ownership.  If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:00 PM EDT, April 2, 2007.  Expressions of interest should include building name and address, location of space in the building, rentable square feet offered and rentable rate per square foot (specifying services and utilities included), ANSI/BOMA defined usable square feet, percentage of common area factor used to determine the rentable square feet, one-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered, and contact information for owner or authorized agent.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging , IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with the Peninsula College of Medicine and  Dentistry, University of Exeter for project entitled “Analyses of Data from the “Studies of Aging and Genome Wide Associations” (SAGA) – Phase I.  The contractor will conduct extensive quality control checks to filter out poorly performing genotypes.  These will include screening out or clearly labeling SNPs with low call rates, departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, low quality scores and poor duplicate performance.  To determine exact criteria for excluding data the contractor will liaise with the NIA Laboratory of Neurogenetics and Illumina.  The contractor will prepare a linked database of cleaned genotyping data and baseline InCHIANTI phenotype data.  This will include the principal physical performance outcomes, summary disease status measures and potential confounders.  The contractor will perform a primary analysis of SNP – principal phenotype comparisons.  An initial screen of statistically significant associations between genotypes and the short physical performance battery score will be undertaken.  The contactor will use the “PLINK” software, as used by the NIA Neurogenetics laboratory, to complete this step.  The contractor will perform a primary analysis of SNP – phenotype comparisons against these markers.  NIA staff will collaborate on determining a single summary marker of inflammation as a primary outcome.  An initial screen of statistically significant associations between genotypes and the inflammatory and fasting glucose markers will be undertaken.  The contractor will use the “PLINK” software, as used by the NIA Neurogenetics laboratory, to complete this step.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).  The cited authority is applicable because the University of Exeter is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  The contractor has led an NIA supported candidate gene association study (NIH Grant 5R01AG024233-03) on aging phenotypes, including the utilization of data from the InCHIANTI study.  Early results have remarkably good, including discovery of role a CDKN2a (p16/ARF) polymorphism on aging.  This finding indicates that physical function markers (gait speed, chair stands and balance in the Short Physical Performance Battery SPPB scores) can be used in InCHIANTI and other studies to fund important polymorphisms.  The contractor has also examined polymorphisms in several inflammatory markers, including Interleukin-18, 1 receptor antagonist and 6 receptors.  The contractor has also studied the role of the TCF7L2 variant of type 2 diabetes in the InCHIANTI study.  The period of performance is 12 months.   The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541990 and the size standard is $6.5 million.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a sole source delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-05-G-0007 to North Star Scientific Corporation (NSS), Kapolei, HI, 96707, to procure AN/APS-145 radar transmitter WRA upgrades for the E-2C aircraft and associated efforts as may be necessary to accomplish this work. This effort will encompass Phase II of the AN/APS-145 Transmitter Replacement (ATR) program. Phase I of the ATR program was completed under a previous delivery order under the subject BOA. This action will be negotiated on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements), as NAVAIR believes that only NSS possesses the knowledge, experience, and patent pending technical data and design drawings necessary for a HEATx RF module type design required for the AN/APS-145 radar transmitter WRA upgrades that will provide a 500% increase in “Mean Time Between Failure” and a 50% reduction in life cycle costs, while maintaining E-2C radar band-width and power requirements, and as such is the only firm with the requisite knowledge and technical data and expertise necessary for this effort. The Primary POC is Deborah Flaherty, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-757-7030, Fax 301-757-7054, email Deborah.Flaherty@navy.mil.  See Note 22.

<DESC>Strategic Systems Programs intends to issue a competitive solicitation to The Boeing Company, 3370 Miraloma Avenue, Anaheim, CA  92803 and to Lockheed Martin Corporation, BMC3 & Strategic, Systems, 55 Charles Lindbergh Blvd, Mitchel Field, NY  11553.  Only one contract will be awarded by the Government under this Competitive solicitation. 

The effort will be for the logistics support of D5BF Navigation tactical subsystem, test, handling and shipping equipment.  The contractor shall provide TRIDENT II material and technical support services necessary to conduct equipment modification and repair for the Ships Navigation System and related components, and to support the navigation equipment Strategic Program Alterations (SPALTs).  The contract will also include a provision which gives the Government the option to increase the level of effort up to thirty percent (30%) over the level of effort provided for in the contract.  Performance is scheduled to begin on 01 September 2007 and continue for one year, with four one-year option periods.  The solicitation will be issued on or about 15 April 2007. Please notify the point of contact above with your desire to receive a copy of the solicitation.

The D5BF Navigation tactical subsystem is a highly technical, specialized and complex suite of equipment used on TRIDENT II SSBNs.  The Boeing Company and Lockheed Martin Corporations as designers and developers of the equipment are the only known sources who have the unique experience, capability and facilities to perform the effort required under this procurement request.  In particular these contractors have knowledge of maintainability, usage rates, reliability and provisioning trends of the system.  This type of knowledge is crucial when providing the support being contracted for under this proposal.  Consequently because of the sensitivity of the equipment in terms of storage, and repair the contractor managing the logistics effort for this equipment must have extensive experience and an understanding of the equipment to prevent mishandling and misinterpretation of program information which could result in adverse impact to SSP ability to support SSBNs.  

This requirement is not set-aside.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Southwest, San Diego, California, is preparing to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Remediation Services at various locations in Alaska, Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and other DoD sites nationwide.  The resulting contracts will be firm fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ), environmental multiple award contracts (EMAC).

This procurement is unrestricted for competition amongst all interested firms.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 562910, Environmental Remediation Service.  The contract(s) will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one year options periods.  The minimum guarantee for each contract is $5000.  The minimum guarantee applies to the five-year term of the contract.  The aggregate value of task orders issued under the resulting contract(s) shall not exceed $100,000,000.  The Government intends to award without discussions.

This contract focuses primarily on services for performing remedial actions at environmentally contaminated sites.  The sites will consist of those ranked on the Superfund National Priority List (NPL) as well as non-NPL sites regulated under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Underground Storage Tanks (UST), Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP), State environmental regulatory programs and other sites, which might require remedial action. This contract focuses primarily on environmental restoration projects but could involve other environmental work such as compliance projects.

Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and FAR Supplement as applicable.  Contracts will be awarded to the responsible firm(s) whose proposals, conform to the solicitation, and are determined the "Best Value" to the Government based on cost and non—cost factors.  The Government intends to award one contract with the proposed Task Order 0001 and to award the remaining contract(s) with the minimum guarantee of $5000 each.  The Government reserves the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in the solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s).  

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors: Factor 1-Past Performance; Factor 2-Commitment to Socio-Economic Programs; Factor 3-Specialized Experience; Factor 4-Safety; Factor 5-Engineering and Management Approach(PTO 0001); and Factor 6-Price Proposal (PTO 0001).  All technical evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly more important than Factor 6-Cost/Price.  While cost/price to the Government is a consideration, it will not be the overriding basis for contract award.  The proposed cost/price and other non-price factors will be evaluated to determine the most advantageous proposal to the Government.  Therefore, the Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price proposal.

A pre-proposal site visit for the Proposed Task Order 0001 project will be held at the Naval Base Point Loma (NBPL), San Diego, CA.  The address is Admiral Kidd Club and Conference Center, 33050 Acoustic Ave., Bldg. A3, San Diego, CA 92147.  The site visit will be conducted on 23 April 2007 at 8:00AM PST.  All firms interested in attending the site visit must submit the following information by email to gina.snider@navy.mil no later than 16 April 2007 at 2:00 PM PST:  Full name of individual(s) attending, company name, phone number, and last four of your social security number.  Individuals not registered by 16 April 2007 will not be able to attend.  All individuals attending the site visit must be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent resident (green card).  For access to the site, all individuals must have a government-issued identification on them (i.e. driver’s license, passport) and lawful permanent residents must have their green card.  Costs associated with participating in the pre-proposal site visit/meeting or responding the solicitation will not be compensated.  

The solicitation will be available by electronic media only and can be downloaded free of charge via the Internet World Wide Web at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil or http://www.fbo.gov under pre-solicitation notice N62473-07-R-3212.

<DESC>Per the Energy Act of 2005, a minimum level of renewable fuel use in the transportation sector must occur, beginning in 2006. The majority of this renewable fuel is expected to be ethanol. EPA?s Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Assessment and Standards Division (ASD),  has a requirement to estimate the impact of the increased use of renewable fuels in Class I and Class II Nonroad engines.  OTAQ  is investigating the use of the renewable fuel, ethanol,  in a blend with gasoline at a volumetric content of approximately 10% ethanol. OTAQ?s testing program will improve the EPA?s ability to estimate the impact of this  increased use of renewable fuels on gasoline emissions. The successful contractor shall provide the Agency with a testing program that will focus on small non-road engines which meet EPA?s Phase II emission standards. The testing program will also include three fuels with an option for a fourth.  The base quantity will consist of testing eight engines using three fuels in accordance with the specifications identified in the statement of work.  EPA?s National Vehicle and Fuels Emission Laboratory located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, shall provide all personnel, materials, services, equipment and facilities to perform the tasks identified in the Performance Work Statement. The tasks to be performed under the Performance Work Statement include: (1) Provide a QAPP (Quality Assurance Project Plan), governing the conduct of research for this project at the contractor?s facility; (2) Engine Correlation Testing to establish the contractor?s ability to perform the tests satisfactorily; (3) Engine Dynamometer Aging to break in and age engines to half of their useful life; (4) Emissions Testing, using the 6-mode steady-state A-cycle, which conforms to Title 40 CFR 90; (5) Emissions Reports reflecting ongoing testing and a final report.   Options may be exercised in order to complete the following optional tasks: (Option 1) Testing on E-20 requires that three additional emission tests are performed on each engine on E-20; (Option 2) Alternate Approach Emissions Testing requires engine testing using governed operation in Mode Point 1 of the test cycle; (Option 3) Testing to Measure Pre-Catalyst Emissions on 1-2 engines to measure pre-catalyst emissions; (Option 4) Limited Testing to Measure Pre-Catalyst Emissions on a single fuel; (Option 5) Disposition of Test Articles to ship the engines to another location; (Option 6) Additional Engine Tests requests pricing from the contractor for additional engine aging, testing and reporting. EPA anticipates the award of a Firm-Fixed-Price contract with one 12 - month base period, and six (6) options for additional testing, engines and/or fuel. The solicitation will be issued on a full and open competitive basis; it will not be a small business set-aside.  The applicable NAICS code is 541380.			 Solicitation No. PR-CI-07-10362 is expected to be issued in mid April and to close approximately 30 days thereafter.  It will be available on the Internet at www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.

<DESC>The US EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Association of Boards of Certification (ABC) under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 in support of its National Tribal Operator Certification Program. The Office of Water, under regulations promulgated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, is required to ensure that public water systems must be operated by qualified personnel, including those systems in Indian country.  The National Tribal Operator Certification Program will be similar in nature to the current SDWA Operator certification program that applies to states.   This would include the development and administration of standardized exams testing operators knowledge, skill, ability, and judgment relative treatment and distribution systems ABC is uniquely qualified to implement EPA's Tribal Operator Certification Program based upon its experience in assisting state with environmental certification.  It has developed standardized exams available for Drinking Water Treatment Plant Operators, Class I-IV; Distribution System Operators, Class I-IV; and Very Small Water System Operators.  The questions on these exams have gone through an extensive validation process.  ABC also has extensive experience in administering these exams and has established the prerequisite certification, exam, education and experience requirements required for operators to demonstrate prior to taking the exams. Based upon the foregoing, EPA finds ABC uniquely qualified to develop EPA?s  National Tribal Operator Certification Program.  It has an existing program that can be easily modified to accomplished the required tasks.  Further, using the current SDWA Operator certification program as a baseline should allow transferability of certifications between Indian country operators and state operators. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability by  responding  to the office identified above.  The capability statement should address the interested party?s knowledge of operation of drinking water systems, both treatment and distribution, from very basic simple systems to complex systems.  Interested parties should also address its experience in developing examination questions and exams for varying levels of certification and a proven methodology for validating questions. Finally, interest party?s should address its experience in administering paper-based and web-based exams.   This documentation must be received by April 6, 2007 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to David Plagge by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail plagge.david@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract. Telephone responses will not be honored.

The purpose of the National Logistics Support Services requirement is to provide logistical support to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) On-Scene Coordinators (OSCs) and other federal officials implementing EPA?s responsibilities as mandated by the National Response Plan (NRP). The Agency?s experiences and lessons learned during the Hurricane Katrina and Rita responses have highlighted the importance of having the ability to provide immediate housing/lodging accommodations, food services, communication capabilities, medical, security, and other support services for personnel responding to emergency situations. As essential personnel are deployed throughout U.S. EPA Region 6 and Region 4 to devastated areas without electricity, running water, sanitation, shelter, and other facilities for indefinite periods of time, sufficient logistical support services must be made available to ensure the safety and security of  response personnel.  It is the Government's intent to award two performance-based, Fixed-Rate, Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts. One contract will be for Region 4 and the other for Region 6. At least one (1) contract will be unrestricted for full and open competition and the other contract is intended to be awarded as a small business set-aside. Each contract will have a 3 year (36 months) based period, and two (2) one year option periods, for a possible total period of performance of five (5) years. Request for Proposal (RFP), PR-HQ-07-11172 is anticipated to be released on or about 21 days from the posting date of this synopsis. Both the unrestricted, full and open contract and the small business set-aside contract will be awarded from one RFP. The purpose of this notice is to notify potential offerors of EPA's forthcoming requirement. This notice, the RFP, amendments, and other information related to this procurement will also be posted on the EPA's Office of Acquisition Management website, at the following address: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm#solam . Interested parties can access procurement information by looking under the "Solicitations and Amendments" heading and select the link for National Logistics Support Services ? PR-HQ-07-11172. All information related to this procurement will be available at this link through the date of contract award. The anticipated award date for both contracts in on or around June 1, 2007. Contract award will be made using a best value approach, with technical capability being of greater importance than cost or price. Regardless of the competitive nature of award, each contract awarded must be technically acceptable and meet cost reasonableness standards.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this requirement include, but are not limited to the following: 541614 - Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services; 561210 ? Facilities Support Services; 541614 ? Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistic Consulting Services; 541513 ? Computer Facilities Management ; 624210 ? Community Food Services; 621493 ?

<SUBJECT>10 -- Deeply Buried Hard Target Fuze
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-PKZB-06-DBHTF
<RESPDATE>022806
<CONTACT>Stacey Hughes, Contracting Officer, Phone (850)882-0190, Fax (850)882-4561, Email stacey.hughes@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) concerning potential fuzes for hard target applications. Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to perform studies and analyses on existing and future weapons capable of being deployed from current and future fighter and bombers to perform required missions against deeply buried targets.   THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.     

Air Armament Center, Capabilities Integration Directorate, Technology Transition and Concept Development Division (AAC/XRS), Eglin Air Force Base is working to develop a replacement hard target fuze for the FMU-143.  The FMU-143 was designed for limited hard target capabilities but has been used for greater depths of penetration with much heavier weapons with greater g-forces than it was designed for resulting in poor performance and questionable results.  
The Government is open to any and all technologies (mechanical, electro-mechanical, electronic safe and arm, etc) that may be available and viable to meet these requirements.  
1.	This fuze needs to be designed to survive BLU-113 penetration capabilities and impact velocities into earthen covered hard target structures of 10,000 psi concrete with or without burster slabs.
2.	Fuze must be compatible with current inventory hard target penetrator warheads to include BLU-109, BLU-113, BLU-116 and any special application penetrators as the BLU-121 and BLU-122.  
3.	Compatibility will include guidance assemblies as the JDAM GBU-31 family, all laser guidance kits as the GBU-24, 27, 28 and any future air to surface penetrators.  
a.	Fuze will be powered by air generator, FZU, and/or by weapon system power, if available, or any other alternate power approach as long as the requirements of Mil-Std-1316 are met.  FZU, if required, will be provided with each fuze.  Fuze will be designed for high altitude releases up to 60,000 ft or weapon envelope (whichever is more restrictive). 
4.	Fuze will be capable of being launched from the following aircraft platforms:
a.	F-15E, F-16, B-2, B-1B, B-52, F-35, F-117, F-22, and UAS.
b.	Fuze will be designed for 200 hours bomber and 100 hours fighter captive carriage life
c.	Release speeds are 200 to 750 KCAS or 1.8 M whichever is less.
5.	Fuze will be designed for up to 255 ft of depth of burial, 1st void sensing with timed delay detonation settings from instantaneous to 255ms in 1ms increments and will allow for longer delays from 4 minutes to 4 hours in 15 minute increments.  
6.	Fuze will be designed for impact velocities of up to 1400 fps with an angle-of-attack (AOA) of up to + 2 degrees.
7.	Fuze will allow for setting arm times from 4 to 30 seconds in 1 second increments.  
8.	Fuze will be capable of initiation of all current insensitive munitions (IM) explosives and be IM compliant.
9.	Fuze will meet MIL-STD-1316, MIL-STD-2105 and STANAG 4187 requirements.
10.	All settings will be programmed either through the cockpit or from the CMBRE or is manually settable on the fuze.
11.	Mission reliability for guided weapons with fuze will be 98%.
12.	Fuze will be designed to meet the USAF safety requirements and standards.
13.	Fuze service life will be 10 years or more; storage life of 20 years or more.
14.	The following additional requirements (future spirals) may be potentially added and should be considered in your response to this request for information:
a.	Void and /or layer sensing
b.	Survive High Speed / Hypersonic impact velocities (1500-2000 fps) and g’s.
c.	Longer delays up to 24 hours
15.	The Government would like to be appraised if any of the above requirements are viewed as cost and/or schedule drivers. 
16.	The Government is also interested in potentially conducting some sled and vibration testing during the 3rd or 4th quarter of FY06.  The Government would like to know if hardware would be available for this effort.  This demo fuze does not have to meet all of the above requirements except for deeper, harder target penetration.

Respondents to this RFI are encouraged to provide relevant examples of ongoing and previous contractual efforts with the Government that support the desired capabilities described. Respondents may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals. Respondents are encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately. AAC/XR uses manpower technical support contractors in fulfilling its mission requirements to include review of these capabilities submittals.  These contracts contain an organizational conflict of interest clause that requires the service contractors to protect the data and prohibits the contractors from using the data for any purpose other than that for which the data was presented. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. All information contained in this RFI is preliminary, as well as subject to modification, and is in no way binding on the Government. Responses should reference Deeply Buried Hard Target Fuze, not to exceed 15 pages in length to include cover page, appendices, tables and figures, and should be mailed to the Air Armament Center, Capabilities Integration Directorate, Technology Transition and Concept Development Division (AAC/XRS), Bldg 349, 207 West D Ave., Suite 308, Eglin Air Force Base, FL 32542-6844, ATTN: Sonny Childress; delivery of electronic copies is acceptable, if under 5MB to sonny.childress@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Roberta Boswell, 508-233-4946
<DESC>The US Army RDECOM Natick Contracting Division on behalf of the Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager  Force Sustainment Systems, Natick, MA, has a requirement for a Commercial Precision Airdrop System that will fulfill the need for several increa sed capabilities such as ground accuracy, standoff delivery, air carrier survivability, and overall improved effectiveness regarding airdrop mission operations. This Commercial Precision Airdrop System will be used with standard equipment utilized for the delivery of payloads aboard the Enhanced Containerized Delivery System (ECDS) and Type V Platforms as described in Field Manual (FM) 4-20.102 and platform reference data in FM 4-20.116, shall have the following performance characteristics: The commercial p recision airdrop system shall provide a steerable, gliding type device capable of delivering loads with rigged weights of 7000-10,000 lbs (T) or 5000-10,000 lbs (O) from altitudes of 24,500 feet mean sea level (MSL).  When released from the threshold altit ude of 24,500 feet MSL, the system shall have an autonomous delivery capability that is able to accurately navigate from a high offset aerial release point, to within a 250 meter radius of the intended point of impact (PI) at an 80% frequency rate. This acquisition will be conducted as a full and open competition (including non-US companies) to evaluate all systems now available in the marketplace that meet the JPADS 10K requirements. A competitive range will be established and offerors of proposals which fall within the range will be requested to participate in a shared government/contractor funded demonstration of their proposed system. The prototype systems will be airdropped, and the systems, as well as the project teams demonstrated knowledge, e xperience, and technical and managerial approach, will be evaluated against performance requirements. This demonstration is currently scheduled for 12  20 July at Yuma Proving Ground.  A down select to one or more offerors will be conducted based on resul ts from the offerors initial proposal, the system demonstration, a technical demonstration report, and the offerors Revised Final Proposal.  A Firm Fixed Price - Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract will then be awarded to one or more offeror(s) with the highest potential to meet the evaluation criteria outlined herein, and within the JPADS 10K programs schedule and budget constraints. If more than one offeror is selected then the government will make multiple awards for the DV ph ase of the program.  A competitive range determination will then be made to select a single contractor for the DT phase.  Although the intent of this acquisition is to utilize a COTS precision airdrop system, it is probable that the offeror(s) whose system  may be chosen will require an amount of systems engineering and contractor support to fully meet the requirements. The contract will allow for the following development phases to be conducted:Base effort to include Design Validation (DV) Developmental/Operational Testing (DT/OT),Production Delivery Order.  The DV and DT/OT phases will be included within the base period of performance and include CLINs for the recurring delivery of supplies and/or services in the form of commercial precisio n airdrop systems, spare parts repairs, system engineering, contractor training, and contractor test support. The requirement for those items may vary with each respective test effort, and will not be known at the time of contract award. It is anticipated that the base period of performance will require a minimum of ten (10) commercial precision airdrop systems.  These test items will undergo evaluation for fit, form and function, and be subjected to airdrop and environmental testing.  Upon successful compl etion of the DV phase the Government will initiate the Developmental/Operational Testing (DT/OT) Phase.  This phase will require the delivery of additional commercial precision air drop systems to conduct DT (the systems delivered for the DT phase must meet all the requirements in the performance document that will be part of this request for proposals), followed by the delivery of additional production representative commercial prec ision airdrop systems to conduct OT.  These items will be subjected to DT/OT to determine if they satisfy all the JPADS 10K requirements identified in the Capabilities Development Document (CDD).  The DT/OT phase will also include the requirement for the d elivery of a Technical Data Package (TDP) (to include complete drawings, lists, and detailed specifications).  Lastly, successful completion of DT/OT testing will allow for the optional production contract phase to be initiated. Under this optional period of performance phase of the contract a Production Delivery Order (Firm Fixed Price) may be issued to meet the Army's initial estimated fielding requirements of approximately 91 JPADS 10K units.  Follow on production contracts may be awarded, based on the T DP, to acquire the remainder of the Armys estimated fielding requirements of precision airdrop systems.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on the RDECOM Natick Contracting Divisions  web site located at https://www3.natick.army.mil/, under Bu siness Opportunities/Ongoing or Upcoming Acquisitions on or about May 7, 2007. A draft performance document will be uploaded to the same website within a couple of weeks of this synopsis.  NO hardcopies will be mailed. Telephone calls will not be accepted.  Questions may be sent to Roberta Boswell, Contract Specialist, via e-mail at roberta.boswell@natick.army.mil or fax (508) 233-5286 or 4998.  Firms will not be reimbursed for any cost associated with proposal preparation except for a sum to cover travel ex penses for the offeror demonstration under a separate purchase order.  This acquisition will be conducted on a Full and Open Competitive basis.

<DESC>The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations and Environment has a requirement to establish a long-term business relationship for the purpose of improving and sustaining military family housing communities at the following installations: For t Greely, AK; Fort Wainwright, AK; Fort Huachuca, AZ; Yuma Proving Ground, AZ; and Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. Collectively these projects are known as the 07 Group. This requirement will be satisfied through the Army Housing privatization program known a s the Residential Communities Initiative (RCI). RCI operates as part of the Congressionally authorized Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) (10 USC 2871). RCI employs best commercial practices in management, development, construction, maintenan ce and operation to meet the Armys long-term needs for military family housing. The Army will award one contract for the Fort Greely and Fort Wainwright project, one contract for the Fort Huachuca and Yuma Proving Ground project, and one contract for the Aberdeen Proving Ground project. The selected offerors will work with the Army to create a Community Development and Management Plan (CDMP) that will describe a 50-year plan to develop, re-develop, construct, maintain and operate the housing assets at each  of the particular 07 Group projects. The Army will solicit this requirement on an unrestricted basis using a Request for Qualification (RFQ). The Army intends to publish the 07 Group RFQ on or about April 10, 2007. At Step One, the RFQ will seek, from int erested offerors, a five-page submission addressing three Minimum Experience Requirements (MERs). The closing date for receipt of MER submission will be on or about April 25, 2007. Once the evaluation of the MERs is complete, those offerors who have satisf ied the MERs shall be eligible to further compete for the 07 Group by submitting a complete Statement of Qualifications (SOQs). Offerors will be provided a minimum of 30 calendar days to provide their SOQ submissions.  The Army recognizes that its RCI solicitations include a Step One selection process that remains fairly constant. Providing a mechanism to allow certain previously qualified offerors to avoid submitting duplicative documentation for Step One can enhance of feror and Army efficiency. Current potential offerors who have qualified for inclusion in the highly qualified competitive group (HQCG) in the 06 Group Army RCI solicitation, and whose composition of principal members includes at least the same principal m embers (with the same responsibilities) since inclusion within that competitive group, may waive the requirement to submit Minimum Experience Requirements (MERs) and Statement of Qualifications (SOQs) on the solicitation. Instructions for requesting a waiv er will be provided in the RFQ. The Army, in its sole discretion, will determine whether the offeror fulfills the waiver requirements. Offerors not qualifying for a waiver will be asked to submit Step One information in accordance with the RFQ.  The 07 Group RFQ and amendments will be available at the Army RCI web page at http://www.rci.army.mil. Selecting the 07 Group button from the Army RCI web page will link offerors to a site where they can view and download the RFQ and amendments. Prospectiv e offerors will be requested to register at the site. Registered offerors will receive electronic notification when amendments are posted to the web page. The Army will only respond to questions about the RFQ if they are received by electronic or facsimile  medium. The Army will not reply to any questions submitted later than 10 days prior to a submission deadline. All comments or questions by e-mail should be directed to nichol.fitzpatrick@usace.army.mil. If by facsimile, comments or questions should be dir ected to Nichol Fitzpatrick at telephone (301) 677-2987 or fax (301) 677-4017. Army responses to questions will be issued in the form of an amendment to the RFQ and can be found at the 07 Group link at  http://www.rci.army.mil.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Remedy licenses.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/DO is renewing their support contract for the Remedy Help Desk Application Software as well as the licenses that they currently have from a previous procurement of Remedy.  They will be utilizing this support during ad after the DO/PPT Help Desk integration; it is imperative that this product support be renewed.  The following is a description of the services required which will be renewed with the award of this requisition: CA/CST/DO needs programming capability to implement the new Remedy system.  These software development licenses will be used to create a developmental/test environment for the ARS-DO implementation of the Remedy ITSM products suite.  As well as creating a separate development/test environment for ARS-DO Remedy, these licenses will also allow the DO-Training team to train users using a mirror image of the current product database without impacting the production dataset. The value enhancement of a development environment is the ability to leverage additional features and functionality of the BMC Remedy product line.  Additionally, the environment can be torn down and rebuilt with an exact replica of production environment resources at any time without affecting the productions environment.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. This requisition is to renew the existing support contract and licenses which is justified by the following qualifications, unique to this requirement:   The BMC Remedy ITSM suite has been in use in DO since August 2005.  Internal and external groups utilize this system to inform and resolve problem areas and to manage the process of issue resolution.  Prior to last August, the programs used by DO to track trouble tickets and assets had traditionally been customized, internally developed applications.  Based on many analyses, DO moved from the custom application to an “out-of-the-box” solution that leverages industry standards and realigned business processes with industry best practices.  It has been recommended, based on a cost-benefit analysis, to configure a development environment for: ·	Conducting development efforts ·	Testing developed products ·	Compatibility testing ·	Use case scenario testing ·	Infrastructure change testing and evaluation ·	Training ·	Demonstrations The project team has received a dedicated server intended for use as a development and testing server.  It has been configured and is currently using temporary demo licenses obtained from BMC.  These temporary licenses allow DO to utilize the server for development and testing on the implemented ITSM modules until the purchase of development licenses is completed.  Development and training on the remaining modules cannot be performed in the system’s current state.  Using the dedicated server, the project team will apply the development licenses, which will provide the ability to perform development and testing activities for all ITSM modules in an isolated environment.  The development environment will mirror the production environment in every aspect possible.  Changes made in the development environment can be: ·	Duplicated in the production environment which will be the case with successfully tested and approved changes ·	Rolled back in the case of failed changes, unapproved changes, and after each training session to reset the databases, allowing the next training session to be conducted 	Separating the development from the production environment is an industry best practice.  The greatest benefit of the development environment will be that all changes that might cause a service disruption are isolated. Additionally, if developmental efforts have to be performed in the production environment, DO’s Remedy ITSM suite would be significantly impeded.<BR><BR>support contract # 32102.<BR><BR>CHANGED LINE ITEM 004<BR><BR>CHANGED LINE ITEM 001<BR><BR>

<DESC>This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources interested in providing Security Protection at 45th Space Wing at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS). The Security  Protection Force service would most likely include the following: A full Security Force service for the 45th Space Wing at CCAFS, Florida. The term "full Security Force services" refers to duties performed on USAF installations typically performed by military USAF Security Forces. The contractor shall provide a comprehensive security services program for CCAFS, Florida and its associated Eastern Range Florida Annexes. It shall include security management, operations, administration, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except those designated as Government-furnished) to perform all tasks related to a Security Force.  This is not a contract for night watchmen or minimal guard services. It is a contract for a uniformed Security Force that is trained and armed to meet the requirements, capabilities, and quality of USAF standards in accordance with AFI 31-101 and AFI 31-201. All Security Force members will maintain a DoD Secret security clearance.

The work provides for the planning, management, and operation of the security function for the protection of USAF priority and critical resources, government property, force protection, and classified information.

The contractor shall develop and implement an Installation Security Plan in accordance with AFI 31-101 that detects hostile activity, controls entry and access to priority resources, and, if necessary, defeats a hostile force, while adhering to requirements relevant to "arming and use of force" in accordance with AFI 31-207.  The nature of the Security Force mission requires that the contractor have the provisions to ensure continuous security services in the event of work stoppage or labor strikes that degrade the security services function.

The contractor shall respond to all identified security problems on CCAFS.  The contractor shall provide security of the perimeter of CCAFS.  The contractor shall staff certain designated internal secondary perimeter posts for the protection of priority resources.  

Due to the mission of the 45th Space Wing at CCAFS the contractor will need the ability to surge manning for space launch operations, launch vehicle processing, and contingencies (physical security malfunctions/failures, or immediate threat conditions).  Launch operations and vehicle processing are scheduled activities. In the case of physical security malfunctions/failures or threat conditions the contractor is required to meet manning requirements within two hours of notification of the malfunction/failure or implementation of the Installation Security Plan.  

The contractor shall provide all necessary badging equipment for entry to the installation and critical resources as defined by AFI 31-101, and subordinate instructions/directives.  Security Forces vehicles shall contain the appropriate emergency equipment and identification to include emergency lighting, sirens, two-way radios, and in car video/audio evidence collection system for the primary LE patrol vehicles.  On-duty Security Force members shall be armed as defined in AFI 31-101 for each prescribed duty position.

The contractor will operate and maintain a primary Central Security Control (CSC) for the purpose of monitoring electronic security systems for Protection Level 1-4 resources, communications, and dispatch of security forces to security incidents or emergencies.  The contractor will maintain an alternate CSC.  The CSC will be operated by an armed security force member.  Maintainers of such equipment are required to maintain a DoD Secret security clearance.

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a Security Management Plan (SMP).  This SMP will be submitted to the Security Functional, 45 SFS/S6, for concurrence.  The SMP will specify the Contractor's implementation of security for priority resources.  The SMP shall support the daily operational missions and threats of CCAFS plus the various contingencies to ensure security of priority resources.  The plan shall include the integration of security requirements for resources protection; methodology for expanding the workforce when required to support variable security needs; command, control, and communication procedures for Security Forces; and maintenance of Security Forces personnel qualifications.          

The contractor would maintain public safety and the safety of the workforce.  The contractor would maintain safe and secure operating locations and be flexible and innovative in protecting and preserving physical and environmental assets.  The contractor would professionally manage resources and the infrastructure to ensure sustainability, reliability, energy conservation and cost efficiency of the facilities, systems and equipment at CCAFS.  The contractor would provide facilities support and assure superior customer satisfaction by accomplishing the work described herein within the time limits specified, the constraints present, the schedules and budgets identified by the customer.

Secret facility and safeguarding clearances will be required in the performance of this work. Companies proposing on this acquisition must be U.S. owned and personnel supporting this contract must have a minimum of a Secret Clearance.

<SUBJECT>18 -- Space Based Infrared System, (SBIRS) Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite (GEO 3) and two additional Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) payloads (HEO 3&4)
<SOLNBR>07-32

<CONTACT>Colleen Trickey, Contract Negotiator, Phone 310-653-4541, Fax 310-653-4150, Email colleen.trickey@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The Space Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) program office intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the production of 1 additional SBIRS Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite (GEO 3) and two additional Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) payloads (HEO 3&4). GEO 3 and HEO 3&4 are anticipated to be derivatives of the existing designs developed under the SBIRS Engineering and Manufacturing Development Contract with minimal modifications. The SBIRS program office anticipates releasing the RFP in June 2007 with a contract award in January 2008. The contract type will be cost-plus award fee and cost plus incentive fee.           

The current SBIRS contractor is Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC), Sunnyvale, CA. It is anticipated that this effort will be awarded to LMSSC as a sole source award. (See numbered note 22)

The government?s acquisition strategy is to build nearly identical replicas of the second GEO and HEO production units. However, the government recognizes minor design changes will be required to accommodate parts and material obsolescence, new directed specification changes, corrections to GEO 2 and HEO 2 waivers and deviations, and application of additional government specifications and standards. The government directed specification change for HEO is a new Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) performance specification. The government directed specification changes for GEO include, but are not limited, to incorporation of a secondary payload and a change to Dual Universal S-Band/SGLS.GEO 3 is intended to continue deployment of the full SBIRS High constellation. HEO 3&4 are planned as replenishments for the first two HEO payloads. The new GEO satellite and HEO payloads must integrate with the existing ground operations and maintenance support infrastructure with minimal changes.           

Interested parties who believe they have the capability to perform as a prime contractor in support of this production effort must include the following information in their SOC: Personnel/Size Standard, Company Name, Mailing Address, Point of Contact and Telephone Numbers, Business Size Classification, Large, Small, or Other, and experience-specific work previously performed or being performed relevant to this follow-on effort.  Small Business companies with the capability to perform this requirement are encouraged to participate. The small business size standard for this requirement is NAICS 336414 (1000 employees). If you are interested only in subcontracting opportunities please indicate clearly in your submission.The SOC shall not exceed ten pages.The government will use this SOC to determine if there is sufficient interest in the marketplace from qualified sources to attempt full and open competition. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. The Government will not pay any costs associated with the submittal of information solicited herein.The SOC and all related communications that contain proprietary information should be marked as such.       Verbal responses will not be accepted. Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms with the capability and capacity to perform this requirement are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.

An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call Mr. John Wagner. You can reach him at john.wagner@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-2138.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Blackberry Services.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the Blackberry Services as a key component of the Department’s OpenNet Everywhere (ONE) networking server farm.  The services listed above are required to provide services to support the system expansion.  This expansion will include the software necessary to support 2520 concurrent Blackberry users at two separate sites including the HST building and BIMC.  This infrastructure will provide the proper redundancy and end user support in the event of an emergency if needed. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s Blackberry networking infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>National Security Technologies LLC (NSTec) is the management and operating contractor for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) at the Nevada Test Site (NTS).  The NNSA has tasked NSTec with addressing certain constituents in classified material in preparation for long term storage.

Stabilization and potentially decontamination is required for 32 drums of classified material for the following reasons:

a.	To ensure compliance with the Nevada Test Site Waste Acceptance Criteria (NTSWAC) process utilized for long term storage (analysis and/or stabilization as necessary to address chrome, or sanitization of classified material via metal melting).
b.	Segregate potentially solvent contaminated combustibles or other miscellaneous materials that might be packed with the classified material. Trichloroethane (assumed to be 1,1,1,-trichloroethane) and wipes were used for general cleaning purposes in the disassembly process.  The 1,1,1-trichloroethane would not have come into direct contact with the beryllium. 
c.	Analysis and/or stabilization of classified material as necessary and treatment of any mixed low level waste which may be generated as a result of visual examination and segregation of the classified material.  Sanitization of the classified material via metal melting is an acceptable alternative to analysis and/or stabilization.

The objective is to have an independent vendor analyze and/or stabilize classified material drums at a secure facility to meet the NTSWAC process utilized for long term storage.  Decontamination may be required in order to meet the NTSWAC.  Sanitization of the classified material via metal melting is an acceptable alternative to analysis and/or stabilization.  The vendor will meet Department of Energy (DOE) classified material handling requirements.  Any mixed waste generated in the process will be managed in accordance with applicable requirements.  Once the classified material has been analyzed and/or stabilized, the classified drums will be returned to NTS.  

The vendor must have an existing DOE approved security plan and Q-cleared personnel for performing this work.

NSTec will commence shipment of these materials to the awarded vendor by May 30, 2007.  Classified material must be able to meet the NTSWAC for long term storage and returned to NTS by September 15, 2007.

<RESPDATE>040607
<CONTACT>Kelly Tillery, (405)  954-7831
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of eight (8) RF Bandpass filters.  The purpose of each filter is to eliminate the interference caused by the long pulse width of the ASR-11 into the National Weather Service NEXTRAD Radar.  The required specification value of each filter was determined to be in concert with NTIA and the NWS.  The filters type is standard "iris and vane" architecture due to the size of the waveguide and the desired length of the filter (WR284 waveguide with CPR-284 flanges, 36 inches long).  It has been determined that a chebshov filter design will also work.  The FAA has additional specifications for each separate filter, which will be provided to the qualified vendors if the FAA chooses to take further action towards the procurement. Potential sources must provide a capabilities statement and examples that demonstrate the vendor's capability to provide the prescribed RF Bandpass Filters.  Only responses providing the required information in response to this market survey will be considered prior to further action by the FAA.  Any information received as a result of this announcement will not be provided to other contractors and will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The final determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Mark responses to this market survey with Market Survey File 07-00646, to arrive by April 6, 2007, no later than 2:30 pm CST.  Facsimile responses are permitted at 405-954-9219.  Email responses are permitted at kelly.tillery@faa.gov.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  This market survey shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these items.  Responders to this market survey may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.

The following is a description of the flight recorders:  The multifunctional information distribution system (MIDS) flight recorder connects directly to the support port of the MIDS terminal without the need for a device to convert from the terminal’s AUI format to Ethernet.  It is a Link-16 terminals, including JTIDS Class 2s, FDLs, MIKS LVT(1)s and MIDS LVT(2)s , are used by the military for tactical communications.  A Support Port on these terminals provides a means of obtaining detailed information about the data exchanged.  In addition to recording all transmitted and received messages, the support port records data not normally available on the 1553 bus including transmissions originated by the terminal such as its own PPLI, initial entry messages, machine receipts, and relayed messages, as well as navigation performance data, signal quality measurements, and digitized voice.  In addition to the AUI interface, the flight recorder includes two 1 PPS timing signals inputs.  The fractional difference between these is periodically measured and recorded to facilitate correlating Link-16 data (time-tagged with JTIDS network time) with TSPI data (time-tagged with GPS UTC time).  The recorded data is stored on removable Compact Flash.  A software utility package is included which allows the test analyst to specify exactly what data is to be recorded (FIMSs, FOMs,DTBs, IDBs) without impacting the mission computer.  This software package also includes data extraction routines to support analysis of the recorded data.  The flight recorder requires 28V aircraft power, weighs less than 5 lbs, draws less than 5 amps, and meets the following environmental specifications:

<DESC>This is a Screening Information Request (SIR) for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Office of Security (SEC), Personnel Security Division (PerSec).  TSA hereby makes aware all interested parties that it is soliciting Technical Capability Statements under a SIR to fulfill its Program Support requirement.  This SIR is open to all companies under the Small Business Administration 8(a) Program under NAICS code 561110 for which each company must be certified.  

Any and all updates to this SIR will be posted to the Government Point of Entry at www.fbo.gov.  Interested parties are encouraged to check www.fbo.gov frequently for possible updates.  While any and all questions must be directed to one of the Government points of contact identified in this SIR, answers to those questions, as well as any and all clarifications, extensions or changes will be posted to www.fbo.gov and will only be available at www.fbo.gov  

This procurement will be conducted using the Transportation Security Administration Acquisition Management System (TSAAMS).  Interested parties may learn more about the Acquisition Management System at http://fast.faa.gov.  TSA is exempted from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA – Public Law 107-71) and empowered to use TSAAMS by the same authority.  TSA will conduct this solicitation using the following steps:  

The Statement of Work (SOW), please see attachment, should be referenced for the required submission.  

Interested parties shall submit a Technical Capability Statement that includes the following:

1.  A technical approach demonstrating how the offeror plans to provide professional support meeting the qualifications and requirements of staffing  for the effort as set forth in the SOW.  

2.  An executive summary of the offeror’s recruitment and retention plan.  

3. Three (3) and only 3 (no more, no less) past performance examples of similar size, scope and tasking to that of the SOW.  Past performance examples shall demonstrate the ability of the contractor to provide the required staffing levels on the day period of performance of the contract began.   The name of the customer, including contracting agency, address, point of contact phone number and email; contract number, type of contract, and dollar value; date of contract, period of performance, and place of performance; and a brief description of contract scope and responsibilities shall be included.   

Any data submitted other than the information requested above will not be evaluated.

TSA will evaluate the Technical Capability Statement based on the following:

1.  Offeror’s realistic ability to provide the support for each position and provide personnel who meet the qualifications and requirements as set forth within the SOW.  An approach that discusses all positions but focuses on the non-administrative staffing positions stated in the SOW will be considered a strength.

2.  Offeror’s realistic ability to recruit and retain professional support that meets the qualifications and requirements as set forth in the SOW.  An executive summary that discusses all positions but focuses on the non-administrative staffing positions stated in the SOW will be considered a strength.

3.  For the purposes of this level of screening, the Government will contact the past performance references only to determine whether the contractor was able to provide the required quantity and quality staffing level on contract performance start date.  Firms without prior Government experience are not disqualified from submitting responses; however, any firm without prior Government experience is hereby made aware that Government experience will be considered a strength when evaluating proposals.  Additionally, firms with no prior experience (Government or private) are not disqualified from submitting responses; however, any firm with no experience is hereby made aware that it will automatically be rated as “neutral” for this evaluation factor.  The Government will not inquire as to specific performance issues in this round of screening when contacting references.     

TSA will conduct this level of screening pursuant to AMS 3.2.2.3.1.2.1 : Screening Information Request with the intent of identifying those firms most likely to provide the best value to the Government in fulfilling this requirement.  Those firms who are not selected to advance to the next round of screening will be notified and will have 3 business days to request a debrief with the Contracting Officer (CO).  Those firms who are selected will receive a Request for Proposal (RFP) that includes an invitation to submit a technical proposal and a price proposal.  TSA will then conduct a best value analysis on the technical proposal for each firm included within the competitive range using the evaluation factors that will be provided in the RFP and also by comparing the proposed price to the Technical Capability Statement and the proposed technical proposal.  TSA envisions a single award as the end result of this screening process to a company whose proposed technical solution and price represents the best value to the agency.  However, TSA makes no guarantee of award of contract as a result of this or any future SIR.        

Tentative Milestones:

TSA’s tentative milestones (which the Agency reserves the right to change) for this procurement are as follows:

The contract shall also require the contractor to perform operation and maintenance of the GN2 pipeline system.   GN2 provided into the KSC/CCAFS pipeline shall meet specification MIL-PRF-27401D, Type I (gaseous), Grade B with the additional requirements during Shuttle Launch Countdown operations that the argon level not exceed 150 ppm by volume and moisture level not exceed 6 ppm by volume.  Nominal daily flowrates vary from 1600 scfm to 2000 scfm continuous flow at a minimum 5600 psig pressure.  Daily flowrates of up to 3500 scfm at 5600 psig minimum pressure are possible until late-2010 after which two launch complexes will close thus reducing GN2 consumption from current levels to under 1000 scfm.   Launch support high-flow-rates vary from a minimum of 5000 scfm up to 19,000 scfm for up to 16 hours or 14,000 scfm for up to 24 hours, all at 6500 psig minimum pressure.  It is assumed the contractor would use a liquid nitrogen conversion system for supporting the high-flow-rate requirements.  If true, liquid nitrogen production within 60 miles would be advantageous to the mission of KSC/CCAFS.  Very high consideration would be given to a GN2 production plant, which directly feeds the KSC/CCAFS pipeline and is self-sufficient for liquid nitrogen re-supply (for high-flow-rate operations) within two years of contract award.  Currently, Air Liquide has a production plant right outside the Kennedy Space Center.  There exists an extensive network of NASA owned underground pipeline (~25 miles), six meter stations, eight major valve stations, telemetry system at each meter station, cathodic protection systems, and other appurtenances which shall be operated and maintained.  A nine-mile long gaseous helium pipeline from the CX39/CCF area to CX37 helium meter station is also included since the helium pipeline makes use of the GN2 telemetry system and has a similar cathodic protection system.	Operation and maintenance of these launch critical systems is required to support the basic function of providing GN2 to the KSC/CCAFS Space Port. NASA anticipates awarding a Firm-Fixed Price contract with Economic Price Adjustment for a three (3) year base period and two (2) – one (1) year option periods for an anticipated total of five (5) years.  The current contract for this requirement will expire on September 30, 2007.  This new contract shall require performance to begin on October 1, 2007.  Current NASA usage is approximately 85,000 MCF per month.  This amount should remain relatively consistent through 2010.  After 2010, we cannot predict usage amounts due to the change over from the Shuttle Program to the Constellation Program. Potential sources that have knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and/or capabilities to supply GN2 to the KSC/CCAFS GN2 pipeline system are requested to submit a statement of interest, capability, past-performance, and proposed technical approach to meeting the government's requirements.	This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  However, respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto. All responses shall be submitted to Mr. Anthony Caruvana at (321) 867-3464 or via e-mail at Anthony.M.Caruvana@NASA.Gov no later than April 9, 2007.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are seeking potential vendors under Simplified Acquisitions Procedures for transcribing publications into Braille under the NAICS code 323119.  The project is being set aside for small businesses. Contractor shall transcribe and estimated 4 to 17 Medicare Publications into Braille, which includes creating Braille plates, proofreading, packaging, and distribution of finished Braille products during a reasonable time frame.  Each Medicare Publication scheduled for Braille transcription during the 12- month period of performance will be submitted to the contractor as a task order.  The following documents and files will be included in every task order; a QUARK file (with images & font files) for the Medicare publication to be transcribed; a project plan template which should e completed and returned to CMS Project Officer; an Excel address file – if required.  Sample publications selected for Braille transcription during this contract can be viewed on-line at www.medicare.gov.  Shortly after the contract for Braille Medicare publications has be awarded, CMS will provide the contractor with a list of publication titles tentatively selected for Braille production during the 12-month period of performance.  Titles of Medicare publications that are routinely selected for production in an alternative format are:  Medicare & You Handbook, Your Medicare Benefits, Choosing a Medigap Policy, Your Guide to Prescription Drug Plans.  With the exception of the Medicare & You Handbook, the average number of Braille publications ordered per title can range from 300 to 800.  The average number of Braille Medicare handbooks ordered over the last few years is 2,500 to 3,000 with volume sets ranging from 2-3 volumes in length.  We require the fold and stitch method for binding Braille publications.  Braille versions of Medicare publications generally ship to only 2 destinations – a fulfillment center in Cedar Rapids, IA and the CMS warehouse in Baltimore, MD.  The Medicare handbook on the other hand is distributed to an estimated 225 destinations.  Note: To view the latest revision for the complete text for many of the Medicare publications selected for Braille transcription during the period of performance, to www.medicare.gov and click on “Publications.”  Vendors who are interested must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration, (CCR).  Vendors must have a valid Duns number to register in CCR at www.ccr.gov.  All capability statements should be sent to the attention of contract specialist Renee Wallace-Abney, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 7500 Security Boulevard, C2-21-15, Baltimore, Maryland 21244-1850 or via email at renee.wallaceabney@cms.hhs.gov.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS ISSUED AS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY and while a solicitation does not presently exist, a solicitation will likely be crafted based, in part, upon responses to this notice.

NAVFAC Midwest is currently seeking potential sources for a performance based preventive maintenance and emergency troubleshooting & repair service program for the existing base central steam plant digital boiler control systems.  This is not a request for proposal and no solicitation is available at this time.  A market research survey is being conducted to determine interest and capability of potential sources from any 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, and/or general Small Business offerors.  All interested parties are invited to respond by registering and submitting a statement of capabilities (as described later in this announcement).  

The Central Steam Plant Boiler Control System is comprised of a network of devices including servers, client work station computers, programmable logic controllers, input/output modules, switches, etc, all operating and communicating in an integrated manner using a variety of different software programs/packages that control and facilitate various network processes/applications, such as communications, process control, operator system interface, data storage, etc.  A majority of the applications used by this system were developed by Rockwell Automation and all controller programs are written using Rockwell Automation software, which serves as the backbone upon which the entire control system is built.  Plant operators monitor and control the boilers and other equipment using networked clients/workstations which access process data constantly being collected by system control devices, using a graphical interface operating on the network servers.  The majority of system control equipment is manufactured by Allen Bradley.      

The scope of the anticipated service contract includes a variety of maintenance duties in support of the Central Steam Plant Boiler Control System including routine/periodic preventive maintenance, as well as emergency system troubleshooting and repair.  Routine/preventive maintenance tasks will include system backups, software revision upgrades/installations, checking various network equipment functions/status indicators, etc.  Emergency system troubleshooting and repair tasks will include addressing network equipment and/or control system software program failures or inadequate performance.  These tasks would be performed at varying times, including normal working hours, after hours, on weekends and holidays.  In essence, a Control Engineer with intimate and complete system knowledge must be available to respond to emergencies 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, due to the critical nature of the processes/equipment being controlled by the system.  

An additional category of tasks required under the anticipated service contract includes various control system modification and add-on projects that may be developed during the contract period.  These projects might include control programming modifications or additional logic in support of new or modified control equipment/strategies and may also require the purchase, installation and programming of new control system devices. 

If issued, the request for proposal (RFP) will likely be a combination of Firm Fixed Price/Indefinite Quantity Performance-Based Contract, using Best Value Source Selection Procedures.  In addition, if issued, the RFP will likely include a base period award for a period of up to one year with up to four (4) option periods (years).  Exercise of each option period would depend on contractor performance and whether the requirement continues to exist.  The total duration, including exercise of any options, would not likely exceed sixty (60) months.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238220 for which the small business size standard is $13M. 

This is not a request for proposal and no solicitation is available at this time.

<DESC>The U.S.Army Aviation Applied Technology Directorate Ft.Eustis Virginia is conducting a Sources Sought Market Survey in accordance with FAR Part 10. This notice neither constitutes an Invitation for Bids (IFB) nor a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor do es it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. Within the US Army, there is currently a shortage of lifting systems for units to meet unit mission requirements.   There are numerous types of cranes (Department of Defense (DOD) and comme rcial off the shelf (COTS)) being used with no replacement parts available, and no support to maintain the various systems.  There are no regulated maintenance procedures for these vehicles, and the lack of a standard aircraft crane makes it impossible for  the Army to provide a standard operating procedure (SOP) for lifting operations that all units can use.  There is no formal training currently being provided for the cranes aviation units are using.  Transportation requirements differ from unit to unit, d epending upon what type of crane is being used.  Current cranes are not self-deployable; they must be transported by unit vehicles, which take up space that could otherwise be used to transport other critical equipment or supplies.   The weight and size of  most of these systems in use preclude deployment by CH-47. This sources sought announcement is for a Self Propelled Crane Aircraft Maintenance And Positioning (SCAMP).  The SCAMPs primary function is to remove, replace, transport, and position major air craft components (in the load range of three to seven tons) in support of aircraft rotary wing maintenance.  The SCAMP must be suitable for airmobile operations, and to assist in the recovery of downed aircraft by ground transportation.  The SCAMP will all ow Aviation Soldiers to conduct aircraft maintenance operations anywhere on the battlefield using as few dedicated personnel as possible to perform aircraft maintenance. The SCAMP will enable an agile, maintainable, and strategically deployable Army Aviati on fleet, by assisting with the removal and replacement of aircraft components for component exchange/repair and to remove and replace the aft pylon of the CH-47 aircraft for strategic deployment configuration.  	  As a result, this request for information is being conducted to gain knowledge of sources possessing the capabilities to satisfy the U.S Armys requirements through the use of commercial or Non-Developmental Items (NDI) systems, for a Self Propelled Crane  Aircraft Maintenance And Positioning (SCAMP). The SCAMP must be able to negotiate improved and unimproved surfaces with no degradation in operation, utilizing diesel fuel or JP-8 without degradation in performance. The crane must be able to lift an aircra ft component weighing at least 5000 lbs. The centerline distance between the component and the crane will be a maximum of 14 ft, at a vertical distance of a minimum of 30 ft above ground level. Once the component is lifted from that distance; the crane mus t have the ability to rotate in a 180 deg arc (minimum), off the crane centerline, to off load the component. Due to a requirement to be able to be air lifted externally by a CH-47 helicopter, the crane should not exceed 18,000 lbs .The SCAMP should improv e unit readiness by having a 96% probability of completing all daily missions without requiring maintenance to correct an essential function failure. The SCAMP will be employed in aviation maintenance units worldwide and is expected to operate under the sa me climatic conditions as the aircraft it supports, during daytime or nighttime in adverse weather conditions in a temperature range from -25 degrees F to +140 degrees F. The SCAMP must possess a low profile to enable clearance for deployment by internal t ransport by C-130 or larger aircraft. The SCAMP must be capable of being transported by ground units as cargo on or behind organic vehicles. In order to maintain cost effectiveness the mean time bet ween essential mission failures (MTBEF) should be no less than 222 hours. Interested vendors are invited to submit a three (3) page White Paper providing a description of their system. The White Paper shall include, as a minimum: 1) A description of the sy stem and the validating information supporting claims that the proposed system meets the above performance capabilities; 2) Product literature; 3) Past performance information; and 4) Price schedules/catalogues (not included in the page count). Respondents  must also include information regarding 1) customary practices (include warranties, discounts, etc.) under which commercial sales of the product are made, and 2) requirements of any laws and regulations unique to the items discussed. Additionally, respond ents should express their interest in performing a collaborative effort, e.g., a cooperative research and development agreement or vendor demonstration (without Government funding). Proprietary information submitted in response to this Sources Sought shall  be marked accordingly and will be protected when clearly identified as such. Responses to this Sources Sought should be received no later than 16 April 2007. This announcement is for purposes of exchanging information to improve understanding of the Gover nment requirement and industry capability and is for information and planning. This announcement must not be construed as a commitment by the Government and any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer which could be accepted by the G overnment to create a binding contract. Vendors with systems that can meet the requirements will be asked approximately mid-July, about arrangements for their system to be demonstrated at a Government facility. Address responses to Aviation Applied Technol ogy Directorate, ATTN: AMSRD-AMR-AA-P (Dominick Lubrano), Bldg 401, Lee Blvd, Ft Eustis, VA 23604-5577.

<DESC>Request for Proposal (RFP) release.  The Aeronautical Systems Center F-22 System Program Office (ASC/YFK) will release a Request for Proposal  (RFP) on or about March 21 2007, to Pratt & Whitney Large Military  Engines, a United Technologies  Company for a long-term Performance Based  Logistics (PBL) sustainment contract for the F119 engine for the F-22  weapon system.  ASC/YFK anticipates awarding a long term PBL contract for  sustainment of the present/future F-22 fielded fleet on or about December  1, 2007.  The period of performance for the contract associated with this  synopsis is Calendar Year (CY) 08-CY17.  This acquisition is a follow-on  to the sole source sustainment effort currently being performed by Pratt &  Whitney, under the F-22 production contract FA8611-05-C-2851.  The purpose  of this notification is to announce release of the request for Proposal  (RFP) for potential subcontracting purposes. Program Background The Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) Demonstration/Validation phase  involved two competing aircraft teams, led by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics  (with General Dynamics and Boeing as team members) and Northrop (teamed  with McDonnell-Douglas), and two competing engine contractors, General  Electric (GE) and Pratt &Whitney (P&W).     On 23 Apr 91, the Secretary of  the Air Force selected Lockheed Martin Aeronautics for the air vehicle and  overall weapon system integration and P&W for the engine.  The ATF was  re-designated as the F-22, and Milestone II approval was confirmed by an  Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM), 1 Aug 91, authorizing F-22  Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and long lead procurement  for four Pre-Production Verification (PPV) air vehicles.  EMD contracts  were awarded in Aug 91.  The air vehicle Preliminary Design Review (PDR)  was completed on 30 Apr 93 and the Critical Design Review (CDR) was  conducted on 20-24 Feb 95.  Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation  (FOT&E) began 29 Aug 05 and completed on 23 Nov 05.  The Joint  Interoperability Test Command (JITC) awarded the F-22 Joint Systems  Interoperability Test Certification on 14 Dec 05, finding the F-22 met all  its critical interoperability requirements and certifying it interoperable  for joint use.  Initial Operating capability (IOC) for the F-22 was  declared on 15 Dec 05.  IOC declaration verifies the aircraft as a fully  capable, multi-mission platform ready for combat. Full and open competition was used in the Demonstration/Validation  (Dem/Val) phase of this program.  The program was down-selected to two  teams for both the air vehicle and engine EMD competition.  As a result of  the competition, Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems (LMAS), currently  Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company (LMA) and Pratt & Whitney (P&W) Large  Military Engines received EMD contract awards. The current engine support  program is presently known as Field Support and Training, as part of the  production contract.  The future sustainment effort will establish a  Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract arrangement with partnering of  Air Logistics Centers for depot level repair.  The effort will continue  field sustainment via Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) and  public/private partnering for the entire F119 fleet.  Pratt & Whitney will continue to provide engine sustainment support  through a partnered arrangement with Oklahoma City Air Logistic Center  (OC-ALC) under this resulting contract. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the  Government to award a contract nor does the government intend to directly  pay for any information or responses submitted as the result of this  synopsis. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or  potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this  acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program  director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns,  issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government  personnel.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a seven (7) month bridge contract extension to extend contract N00189-01-D-0018 for husbanding services with St. Maarten in order to complete the formulation of a regional husbanding service provider contract in 2007.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements type contract with firm fixed prices is anticipated.  This acquisition will be negotiated pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by Section 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501 (a), a Sole Source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items.

The follow-on requirement to this current contract has not been issued and a regional North and South American husbanding service provider contract is anticipated.  NAVSUP has taken the initiative to re-engineer the husbanding process.  A worldwide husbanding conference was held in February 2006 in Norfolk, VA that included representatives from Government and commercial industry.  The purpose was to discuss current husbanding processes and future logistic initiatives within the U.S. Navy and work to better align their goals with new contracts.  This conference led to the development of a Process Action Team (PAT) with members from across the NAVSUP claimancy.  The PAT team met all year to research current processes in delivery, contract types, bill payment, and scope of work to name a few.  New themes such as Operations Other Than War and Humanitarian relief also needed to be addressed so that new contracts could better respond to major disasters like Hurricane Katrina or Tsunami relief in Asia.  The PAT resulted in a plan of action approval to pilot new solicitations for North and South America.  This bridge extension will allow FISCN to pursue this new contract.  The estimated time of contract award will be no later than 01 November 2007.

<DESC>This Brand Name justification is for the procurement of 2 BIG IP appliances to provide redundant capabilities in support of Navy ERP Production Center.  Navy ERP has 5 BIG IP appliances fully integrated into the Production and Disaster Recovery (DR) environments performing Network Load Balancing/ High Availability, Application Acceleration and PKI Enablement, both server-side and client-side PKI authentication.    A brand name memo is attached to this posting.    The Government intends to award to lowest priced technical acceptable quote for Licenses and Maintenance.  Specifically, the requirement is as follows: (2) BIG-IP Switch: Local Traffic Manager 6400, (2) BIG-IP Factory Option: 6400 Memory Upgrade (4GB SDRAM), (2) BIG-IP Factory Option: FIPS SSL 140-2 6400 series (8000TPS), (2) BIG-IP Add-on: ACA license, (2) BIG-IP Add-on: Compression license  (100 Mbps), (2) BIG-IP Factory Option: Redundant AC  Power  (6400), (5) BIG-IP Field Upgrade: Redundant AC  Power  (6400), (5) BIG-IP Installation: BIG-IP Products (Per Unit), (2) BIG-IP Service: Premium (Level 1-3) 17% of Product List Price, (2) BIG-IP Service: Premium (Level 1-3) 17% of Product List Price, (2) BIG-IP Service: Premium (Level 1-3) 17% of Product List Price and 12 months of Maintenance.   This notice of intent as a request for competitive proposals.  Send quotes for BIG IP Appliance N00421-07-R-0055 to the attention of Yarinee Tafur, Contracts, Code 2.5.1.1.4 via email yarinee.tafur@navy.mil or fax to (301) 757-6516.   The closing date is 27 March 2007 and estimated period of performance is 01 April 2007 to 31 March 2008. 

BRAND NAME:
This procurement request is for 2 BIG IP appliances to provide redundant capabilities in support of Navy ERP Production Center.    BIG IP provides the following  1)Network Load Balancing / High Availability ? The BigIP presents one server to the world, and then forwards the requests it receives to an array of identically configured servers. This allows for nearly infinite scalability and high availability. The BigIP is deployed in pairs to provide for its own high availability.
2)Application Acceleration ? The Bigip offloads and performs tasks typically performed by the server (SSL decryption, compression, Caching). As it is optimized for these tasks, it can perform them with
much greater results than can be archived by the  server itself.
3)PK Enablement ? The BigIP is capable of performing server-side and client-side PKI authentication.  This is mandated by DoD and can again be done more efficiently by the BigIP than can be done by individual servers.   
Navy ERP has BIG IP appliances fully integrated into the Production and Disaster Recovery (DR) Centers environments performing Network Load Balancing/ High Availability, Application Acceleration and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Enablement, both server-side and client-side PKI authentication.  DR systems are duplicate because of data integrity and risk of data loss.  

In order to procure a redundant system to meet expanded program requirements, Navy ERP must procure the same BIG IP appliances currently implemented.  If Navy ERP was required to procure another manufacturer?s appliance, the Navy would have to remove all of the currently implemented appliances.  The time lost in the effort to replace the BIG IP appliances would delay the deployment of Navy ERP to NAVAIR, scheduled for 1 Oct 2007.  As a highly visible ACAT 1 program, Navy ERP is being closely monitored by the highest levels of the Navy, OSD and Congress.  The Navy ERP Finance and Acquisition functionality can only deploy to Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) at the beginning of a Fiscal Year due fiscal year constraints.  Consequently, even a minor slip in the implementation of the Navy ERP Finance and Acquisition Solution will drive a full year delay, require an additional year of legacy system operations and increase the legacy systems sustainment cost for the NAVAIR Financial Pilot legacy system, SIGMA, by over $32.4 million.  Additionally, a delay in SIGMA may cause a further delay in the deployment to SPAWAR which will generate an additional $6.5 million shortfall.  The Navy ERP Program intends to replace over 250 legacy systems.  Any delay in the Program implementation schedule requires the continued sustainment of high cost legacy systems.

FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE
ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN
SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-14.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339111 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Trace Explosive and Narcotics Detector, which shall include training and installation.

Background

The mission of NIST, as mandated by Congress, is to develop and promote measurements, standards, and technology to enhance productivity, facilitate trade, and improve the quality of life.  Reliable standards are needed to test the performance and effectiveness of trace explosive and narcotic detectors, which protect the public and infrastructure of the U.S.  Currently, NIST has an active program in trace detection metrology using state-of-the-art microanalytical instrumentation and ion mobility spectrometers for trace explosives and narcotics detection. This program is designed to meet the measurement quality needs of organizations and agencies that use such detectors. A critical requirement for NIST is to conduct research on the performance capabilities of emerging trace detection systems being deployed to rapidly scan people and other items passing through security screening checkpoints for the presence of explosives or narcotics. Trace detection systems rely on the removal, collection and preconcentration of particles that are collected from a surface by swipe sampling. The swipe is inserted into the detector where the sample residues are thermally desorbed for detection by ion mobility spectrometry (IMS).  As part of the NIST research program, new standard reference materials and procedures for calibration and evaluation of detector systems are being developed. For this purpose, NIST has several trace explosive/narcotics detectors that represent current technology. A new technology is emerging that utilizes gas chromatography and IMS detection in one system. This allows an improved separation of analytes before detection, enhancing selectivity and decreasing the rate of false positives in field use. 

***All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following:

***Note 1- The limit of detection (LOD) is commonly accepted as the smallest amount of a particular substance that can be reliably detected in a given type of medium by a specific measurement process. The analytical signal from this amount must be high enough above background variations to give statistical confidence that the signal is real, so the LOD is normally defined as the amount of substance that generates an average signal three times higher than the standard deviation of the background signal. In IMS, background variations are very much smaller than the measurement repeatability (standard deviations) of reference samples, so samples at strictly defined LODs would exhibit a false negative rate of about 50 percent (assuming that the alarm thresholds were set at the LODs). To define an LOD where a positive alarm would be expected reliably (over 90 percent of the time), we must factor in the measurement variability. We define this value (LOD90) as the amount of substance that generates a mean signal three times greater than the standard deviation (s) of the individual measurements. The conversion from measurement units (a.u.) to amount of substance (mass) is via the slope of the sensitivity curve (S). We also assume that the mass of analyte in the blank is zero.

LOD90 = 3 ? s ? S, where S = delta (mass)/ delta(a.u.)

***Note 2 - The Detector Challenge (DC), where the false negative rate should be negligible, is arbitrarily defined as the amount of substance that should generate a signal twice the DL90, so that,

DC = 2 LOD90

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to technical questions submitted against RFP Number N00173-07-R-RS02.
Question 1:  In Table 1 of the Attachment, the Dimension cells in the Total Package row are empty.  Was this information accidentally left out? Answer 1: The cells referenced in Question 1 should read NA. The Governments intent is that the total airborne package be comprised of the four individual units listed on the table.  To allow maximum flexibility in placement of the total package components, each unit may be spread over the UAV and connected by cables as needed for data communications and power, or packed together as needed for integration. As noted in paragraph 2 of Section 4 of the specification, the functions of two or more individual units may be combined into a single unit, as well.     
Question 2:  Does a Ground Sample Distance (GSD) of 2 m from 1000 m above ground imply that the Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV) is 2 mr? Answer 2:  Yes.  Also, the platform should move only one GSD between the start of integration for sequential frames.     
Question 3:  What tolerances can be applied to the GSD/IFOB? 10%?
Answer 3: The IFOV may be smaller than 2 mr x 2 mr as long as the full cross-track swath is at least equal to 800 meters (i.e. 2 meters x 400 pixels = 800 meters).  This may be achieved with a smaller IFOB (GSD) and a larger number of pixels. The IFOV can be greater than 2 mr by no more than 10%.
Question 4: Dimensional constraints: Is each subsystem meant to be individually packaged within the dimensions given for it and then integrated into the UAV in individual locations that are not within some single cuboid? Answer 4: See Answer 1, above
Question 5:  Are you able to indicate the relative positioning of each subsystem relative to all the others?  There are dimensions 1, 2, and 3 ....  What is the orientation of each of these relative to the airframe? It probably doesn?t matter for the Controller and transceiver, but may impact imager design and, perhaps to a lesser extent, on the choice of GPS/IMU.
Answer 5:  As noted in Question 2 to Amendment 1 of this solicitation, the Navy has not determined which UAV platform will be used with this system, and is relying on the Offeror to identify the UAV platform or platforms that are functionally and operationally compatible with their proposed system. Given this, the relative positioning of each subsystem, and the orientation with respect to the airframe, is at the discretion of the Offeror. The dimensional constraints were chosen so that the Offeror has considerable latitude in their design, while maintaining the Governments ability to integrate the system onto several platforms.  While not mandatory, the Government prefers that the along track be the same as Dimension 1 for the imager, and there is no preference for the other two dimensions.  Also, while not mandatory, the Government would prefer that subsystems could integrate using COTS cabling that would ease maintenance and replacement efforts for integration to the platform. 
Question 6:  Imaging time:  Is the 15 minute total time just for a single continuous image of which there might be several per flight, or is that the total imaging time per flight?
Answer 6:  The proposed system shall be capable of capturing and storing a single continuous image for at least 15 minutes.  There may be several images captures for each flight, and each may be as long as 15 minutes.  The total imaging time per flight is one hour, as stated in the specification.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 4:  

The purpose of Amendment No. 4 is to inform all offerors that a revised proposal is NOT requested as stated in Amendment 3 earlier.

Azimuth travel: Continuous; Slip ring (9) Elevation travel: -5 to +185 degrees (10) Azimuth limits:  N/A (11) Elevation limits Electrical: UP and DOWN adjustable (12) Software:  UP and DOWN programmable (13) Azimuth Speed: greater than or equal to 30 degrees/sec (14) Elevation Speed: greater than or equal to 30 degrees/sec (15) Azimuth Acceleration: greater than or equal to 60 degrees/sec/sec (16) Elevation Acceleration: greater than or equal to 60 degrees/sec/sec (17) Angle Readout resolution: 0.01 degree (18) Power: 115V plus or minus 10% at 60Hz (19) Weight: System (less than 210 lbs.), Pedestal (less than 120 lbs) (20) Antenna must support simultaneous receive and transmit in L and S-bands
	
	The government will also evaluate each technical package to assure that it reflects and provides a detailed understanding of the technical specifications for the nine existing antenna systems that require refurbishment.  An unacceptable/acceptable rating will be assigned to each offerors proposal.  An offerors technical proposal must be deemed acceptable in order to be considered for award. 
	
	    c.   Existing antenna systems consist of SIX scientific Atlanta series 3200 pedestals with 16-foot parabolic antennas and THREE Datron Systems P/N 120959-102 pedestals with 5-meter parabolic antennas. These systems need upgrades consisting of at a minimum:  (1) New antenna controller with fiber optic interface to the pedestal.  (2) Remote control and slaving via Ethernet. (3) Replacing mono feed system with conical scan feed. (4) New servo motors and gear boxes. (5) Refurbish or replace parabolic antenna. (6) Capable of simultaneously receiving and transmitting LHCP and RHCP signals in the L and S frequency bands. (7) The antenna system shall also provide a camera system with all electrical and mechanical interfaces to mount the camera.  (8) Add a wide band acquisition antenna.  A technical support package for initial installation, integration verification and training is required.  Approximately eight individuals will require training.  Operational manuals, schematics and associated technical documents must be provided. This portion of the contract award will be a base year plus four option year contract (total five years) for the upgrades of two antennas per year with one antenna upgrade the final option year.  This also includes additional requirements and answers to questions from amendments 1 & 2 from the original synopsis/solicitation.. 
	
II. Price Factor:  The price evaluation will document the completeness and reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price. The total evaluated price consists of the total proposed price for CLINs 0001 – 0404 (attached below).    
	
	An assessment of price reasonableness will be performed on the total evaluated price using techniques described in the following paragraphs.  
	
			A.  Completeness: The price proposal will be evaluated for completeness in relation to the offerors proposed technical and management approach and to ensure that it reflects a clear understanding of the requirement.  Price will be considered complete when the offeror has proposed firm fixed prices for all associated CLINs found in the CLIN structure attachment.
	
B.  Reasonableness.  The techniques and procedures described under FAR 15.404-1(b), Price analysis, will be the primary means of assessing proposal reasonableness.  The offerors proposal will be reviewed for compliance with the requirements specified in Section L of the solicitation.  The government will evaluate proposed prices to determine whether prices reflect a clear understanding of the requirements and are consistent with the various elements of the offerors mission capability proposal.  Price analysis techniques may include a comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation, comparison with other contract prices for similar services, and/or a comparison of proposed prices with the independent government cost estimate.  Color or adjectival ratings will not be assigned to the price factor.

C.  Realism:  Realism will be based on an evaluation of the offered price to determine if the cost reflects a clear understanding of the requirements, and is consistent with the various elements of the offerors’ technical information, and is not materially unbalanced or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished.  This will be accomplished primarily by comparing all offers received in response to this solicitation.

	Communications conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the Government reserves the right to ward a contract without the opportunity for proposal revisions.
	
	IMPORTANT NOTE:  For those offerrors that wish to provide a revised cost proposal -  Please contact Mike DeNamur @ michael.denamur@eglin.af.mil for a copy of the CLIN structure.
