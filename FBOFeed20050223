This document will be approved by the Civil Position/Navigation Executive Committee and will be provided to the GPS JPO as a concise statement of what is expecte d for civil monitoring.  The contractor will be required to ensure that capabilities specified in the Civil GPS Monitoring Specification are incorporated into the requirements process for the development of a future version of the GPS OCS.

<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities. HSARPA is the external funding arm for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate. HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), government laboratories, and academic institutions.

HSARPA seeks to develop, test, and commercialize a new set of laboratory-based or portable detection methods for use on the food supply system. Food detection systems will require rapid, high-confidence detection of microbial and toxin threats in order to enable advanced strategies to protect individuals from exposure and reduce contamination of critical food supply infrastructure.

HSARPA intends to initiate the Food Biological Agent Detection Sensor (FBADS) Program, which seeks to develop, test, and transition cost-effective detection methods for use on the food system, with a focus on liquid substrates. Specifically, HSARPA is looking for portable or laboratory-based detection methods that can be used at food manufacturing facilities, or before the food enters a processing or production facility. The FBADS Program will develop optimized detection systems characterized by the following capabilities:

  *Low Limit of Detection;
  *Extremely low probability of false positive (Pfp);
  *Low probability of false negatives (Pfn);
  *Automated operation, easily used by non-technical personnel;
  *Rapid analysis time; and
  *Low total cost of ownership

The FBADS initiative responds to Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-9, “Defense of United States Agriculture and Food”, January 30, 2004. We anticipate that the detection systems developed under this FBADS Program will provide DHS with a capability to prevent any wide-spread harm to our nation’s critical food infrastructure.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to issue solicitation N00024-05-R-2224 for the accomplishment of Post Shakedown Availabilities (PSA) for LPD 17 (SAN ANTONIO) with options for the accomplishment of PSAs for LPD 19 (MESA VERDE) and LPD 21 (NEW YORK).  Drydockings are planned for each availability.  For LPD 17 only, efforts will include an eight-week Fitting Out Availability (FOA)in FY05, to complete system installations and capabilities that were not part of the basic construction and that are necessary to support lead ship Operation Evaluation (OPEVAL). A PSA of up to 10 weeks for LPD 17 will follow in FY06.  The LPD 19 and LPD 21 PSAs will be up to 16 weeks in duration.  FOA/PSA efforts include all manpower, support services, material, and associated technical data and documents required to prepare for and accomplish the FOA/PSA.  The work to be accomplished will include correction of Government responsible deficiencies, installation of approved engineering chang! es (that were not incorporated during the construction period) and new work identified between ship delivery and the start of FOA/PSA.  Efforts will include engineering and management support of FOA/PSAs, testing and post repair sea trials, and other emergent work.  The proposed contract will include scope to allow for emergent availabilities to correct Government responsible deficiencies identified after delivery, that must be corrected to support test & trials prior to the start of the FOA/PSA.  During FOA/PSA, the ship(s) will be made available for completion of fleet funded repairs and changes.  Work on all three vessels will take place in the homeport area in Norfolk, Virginia.  A responsible offer will be considered eligible if the offeror has previously executed a master agreement for repairs and alterations of vessels or is a ship repair firm that can demonstrate those qualifications.

This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons:  a. provision of these services requires the use of proprietary Original Equipment Manufacturer's data and tooling that currently reside solely at the Dowty Aerospace Corporation, b. the propeller system was developed by the Dowty Aerospace Corporation, at company expense and provided to the U.S. Navy's LCAC program under a competitively awarded subcontract from the program's prime contractor, Textron Marine Systems, c. as the propeller system components ar! e proprietary to the Dowty Aerospace Corporation, no other manufacturer has supplied these system components or design alteration data since this original contract, d. it is estimated that the cost of developing an alternate capability would greatly exceed the estimated value of the services needed.  Dowty Aerospace Corporation is the only source that can cost-effectively supply the required services. Short notice specific tasking and expedited service delivery as completed will be required.  Note 22 applies.

These errors could res! ult in significant damage and maybe even loss of the AN/SQQ-32(V) Minehunting Sonar Set.  Therefore it is imperative that this effort is awarded to GHT.  FSC Code:  5995.  NAICS Code:  335929, Size Standard:  1000.  The period of performance will be for approximately 150 days from award.

<ARCHDATE>02232006
<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for a temporary holding facility (feed lot setting) to hold up to 500 wild horses/burros in a safe and humane condition. The period of performance will be one base year plus 4 one year option periods. The facility must be located in the state of Oklahoma, within 20 miles of the intersection of State Highway 19 and I-35, in Pauls Valley, OK.  The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements for the Wild Horse & Burro Holding Facility:  a. Wild horses and burros on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331 1340). As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses and burros are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt-A-Horse program. Before the horses are placed in the Adopt-A-Horse program or long term pasture holding, they are held in feedlot holding facilities. b. The BLM has initiated a management strategy that provides for the removal of more wild horses than our nationwide holding facilities can accommodate. The intent of this proposal is to provide a feed lot setting for these animals while they are cared for, until they are shipped to long-term holding or an adoption. The purpose of this solicitation is to provide for a facility located within the State of Oklahoma to facilitate the preparation of the animals after they are gathered. This is to facilitate the movement of horses and burros to decrease stress and injury and to ensure cost effective operation within the Wild Horse and Burro Program. This allows BLM to maintain an even flow of horses and burros from the gather site, to the preparation facility and on to the contract holding facility. The contractor must provide the following: land, pens, feed, salt, minerals and water necessary for maintaining approximately 500 wild horses; corrals and adequate facilities to load, unload, prepare, and sort wild horses; humane care of all wild horses during receiving holding and preparation, prior to shipment to long-term holding or adoption; regular, on-the-ground observation of the wild horses to ascertain their well-being and safety; management by individuals who are knowledgeable and experienced about the behavior and nutritional requirements of equines. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210.  This solicitation will be available at http://www.fedbizopps.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov on or about March 3, 2005.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided.  Facsimile proposals will not be accepted.  Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) NNG05101266Q on a sole source basis. The products are for the Wide Field Camera (WFC) 3 instrument to be installed on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Barr Associates Inc. was the manufacturer of the original filters. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procesures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Barr Associates, Inc. under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The Goverment requires the purchase of several replacements of infrared and narrow-band filters currently on the HST/WFC3 instrument (F110W filter on Schott RG-830 substrate and F125W filter on Schott RG-830 substrate).  The design of several of the current installed filters is causing ghost images to be formed due to multiple reflections from the filter’s optical surface.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334515   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to TSI, Inc. 500 Cardigan Road, Shoreview, MN 55126, for the acquisition of a Aerodynamic Particle Sizer II, Model 3321. EPA requires an instrument that provides real time high resolution aerosol particle size distribution and concentration data while accounting for the physical size, shape and density of particles being measured. The required measurement range includes 0.5 um to at least 20 um particles. Mie scattering is a  phenomenon that can result in obscure light scattering measurements due to the relationship between the wave length of light and particle size. Instruments which utilize light scattering technology to indicate particle size are not desired due to this Mie scattering effect which can cause  measurements to vary due to a particle's index of refraction. Instruments utilizing electrostatic charge to influence particle measurements are not desired. For the intended use of this instrument, a time-of-flight technique which produces a meaningful measurement reflecting how a particle behaves  in air is the desirable measurement methodology. The time-of-flight method takes into account the physical size, shape, and density of a particle, and is not affected by a particle's index of refraction or electrostatic charge. The EPA has identified TSI Inc., the only vendor capable of satisfy the  requirement. In order to maintain consistency and scientific validity. The circumstance permitting "other than full and open competition" is FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  The intent of this notice is to determine if  any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provided the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. Interested parties who can meet the above  requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication. Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Pamela E. Smith (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. No  telephonic request will be honored.

<SUBJECT>J -- Phased Commercial Logistics Support (PCLS) for the C-2A Greyhound
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-N00019-05-P1-ZA196
<ARCHDATE>03312005
<CONTACT>Michael Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-757-7040, Fax 301-757-7054, Email michael.smith@navy.mil - Jan Roth, Jr., Contract Specialist, Phone 301-757-7037, Fax 301-757-7052, Email jan.roth@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) anticipates the issuance of a sole source solicitation to Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) for a Phased Commercial Logistics Support (PCLS) plan and associated work effort for the C-2A Greyhound, Carrier Onboard Delivery (COD) aircraft.  The C-2A was last produced in 1990 and is currently undergoing a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP).  The solicitation will include activities beyond the scope of the current SLEP to sustain the aircraft and maintain its operational safety until a replacement aircraft is fielded, which is expected to begin in 2017.  The Navy desires to reduce depot level turnaround time, total remaining life cycle costs and the ready-for-tasking (RFT) gap by combining essential operational and maintenance functions under a single Program Integrator.  The C-2A PCLS program is contemplated to include SLEP efforts, program management, depot maintenance, organizational maintenance, sustainment (engineering and logistics), supply chain management, and will leverage partnerships with Government  activities.  Key tenets of the C-2A PCLS program include SLEP, performance-based incentives for RFT gap reduction and operational availability, readiness, and sustainment.  Partnerships between pertinent Navy operational commands, the aircraft manufacturer, Government depots, the Defense Logistics Activity (DLA) and the Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) are essential to effectively and efficiently manage the C-2A inventory to meet vital fleet operational tasking.  

The Navy plans to leverage the technical synergism and production efficiencies between the C-2A and E-2.  While NAVAIR and NGC are both design agents for the aircraft, NGC is the sole aircraft manufacturer, and as such is the only known commercial source possessing the extensive structural design expertise, manufacturing tooling, production facilities and systems integration skills necessary to extend the life of the C-2A aircraft and leverage expertise from the E-2 design while reducing total life cycle cost to the Navy.  
  
Aging aircraft maintenance issues must be addressed while achieving savings in the operation and maintenance of the aircraft.  System safety is a critical component of this award since the C-2A routinely carries military, civilian, government and foreign passengers to/from deployed aircraft carriers. It is expected that the PCLS will deliver a safety record equal to or better than the existing safety record for maintenance related mishaps.  NGC is the only known contractor that possesses substantial C-2A engineering knowledge and experience, structural design capability, C-2A manufacturing tooling and facilities, worldwide field-support and a demonstrated logistical capability supporting Naval Aviation.
  
NAVAIR will also investigate the possibility of including aspects of the E-2C Hawkeye logistics infrastructure to increase synergy with the C-2 effort if it improves reduction in total life cycle costs and a reduction in the RFT gap, and, if appropriate and warranted, include that effort in the resultant contract.   Subcontracting opportunities may exist.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) order under BOA number N00019-04-G-0004 or BOA number N00019-04-G-0002 for integrating and testing the Battle Damage Reporting System (BDRS) into the Tomahawk Block IIID missile variant. The effort required includes modifying BDRS sensor outputs, conducting component level testing, installing the BDRS in the Tomahawk Block IIID missile payload bays, preparing all required safety reviews, and assisting with post-flight test data collection and analysis.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, Arizona 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort.  Since 1994, RSC has been the sole developer, designer and manufacturer for the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR).  RSC solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk Block IIID missile.  RSC currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk missile is required to perform the BDRS integration and testing, RSC is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

(2) Past performance, experience and technical competence:  List 3 recent projects indicating past performance, experience and technical competence in constructing geogrid Reinforced Soil Slopes.  List a minimum of three (3) recent, relevant projects similar in complexity and magnitude to the Reinforced Soil Slope construction of the Kentucky Cold Hill Road/Fish Trap Road Project.  In addition, provide a customer/owner point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address if available.  Within the last ten years, has your firm ever been, or proposed to be, suspended, debarred, or determined non-responsible, based upon an allegation of unsatisfactory performance or fraud? Within the last ten years, has your firm ever had a contract terminated for any reason either as a prime or subcontractor?  This also applies to a partner in a joint venture. Within the last ten years, has your firm ever filed a claim relative to the construction of a roadway facility for (1) a default termination, (2) the imposition of liquidated damages, (3) a termination for convenience that adversely affected your firm, or (4) any damages caused by the owner’s determination that you did not perform in a timely, safe, or contractual manner.

The Government will review and evaluate each firm’s (offeror) documented past performance and will rate them as acceptable or unacceptable.  By acceptable past performance, the Government means that the offeror has a good reputation for satisfying its customers and delivering quality work in a timely manner at a reasonable cost. Acceptable past performance also means the firm has a reputation of integrity, reasonable and cooperative conduct, and commitment to customer satisfaction.  In reviewing and evaluating an offeror’s past performance, the Government will consider information obtained from the firm, and may consider information obtained from other sources.  This includes past and present customers and their current and former employees; past and present subcontractors and their current and former employees; current and former employees of the firm; federal, state and local government agencies (including court records), and private consumer protection organizations.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to provide information on problems encountered on identified contracts and annotate the firm’s corrective action taken.  The Government will evaluate past performance information and will rate the firms as pass or fail. In the event that a firm does not have a record of relevant past performance, or information on past performance is not available, the firm will not be evaluated favorable or unfavorably on this technical evaluation factor. Rather the offeror will be given a neutral rating. 

In accordance with FAR clause 252.215-1, Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition (MAR 2001), the Government will award after evaluations are completed, unless the Contracting Officer determines that discussions are necessary.

Due to changes in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) that adds the Annual Representations and Certifications FAR 52.204-8 (Jan 2005), the Representations and Certifications must be filled-in online at http://orca.bpn.gov/.  The required Annual Form Vets-100 must also be filled-in online at http://vets100.cudenver.edu/ per FAR 52.222-37.  Contractors are not eligible for award unless these requirements are satisfied.

<DESC>The Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) Transparency Implementation Program (TIP) implements transparency measures between the United States and the Russian Federation under the bilateral 1993 HEU Purchase Agreement. The HEU TIP provides assurance that weapons useable HEU material from dismantled weapons is eliminated from the Russian stockpile by monitoring its down blending  into Low Enriched Uranium (LEU).  The HEU TIP achieves these results by sending teams of experts to four Russian uranium-processing facilities, in closed cities, to monitor processing operations. The program also maintains and staffs a Transparency Monitoring Office (TMO) in Novouralsk, Russia for ongoing monitoring operations at the Ural Electrochemical Integrated Plant. This announcement will serve as notice that the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Nuclear Risk Reduction NA-23, is seeking small business prime contractor sources.  The objective of this acquisition is to perform an analysis of capability with Basic and options, which includes the following:  analysis of technical strengths and total operational lifetime costs for current site capability. Under this contract the contractor supports critical NNSA functions and provides technical expertise, not generally available in the Federal workforce, in support of transparency monitoring visits to Russian uranium processing facilities in closed cities located in the Urals and Siberia.  The support activities conducted by the contractor include technical, business logistics, and financial support to the Transparency Monitoring Office (TMO) staff and the Special Monitoring teams on a recurring basis in Russia. Support encompasses: operating an office in Yekaterinburg, providing a full range of in-country services, including; technical support for office automation and communication equipment and services for the TMO; handling all in-country logistical arrangements for TMO and special monitoring team visits; and, managing reimbursement to Russian facilities for services they have provided to the HEU TIP teams (in both Russian Rubles and US $).  A key element in all of this support is ensuring operations, especially those of the TMO, are fully compliant with Russian laws and regulations. The Contractor  interacts with both DOE monitors and Russian plant operators and must be adept in facilitating their interactions.  In this regard, the contractor performs work that requires extensive  technical knowledge of uranium fuel cycle operations, down-blending processes, and monitoring technologies, as well as HEU TIP mission requirements in order to provide the necessary level of support.  The contractor must have an existing office presence in Yekaterinburg, Russia and the current ability to provide logistical support to monitoring visits within closed cities in the Urals and Siberia. The contractor must also be able to provide a full range of in-country business services and handle all arrangements for TMO and special monitoring visits. The contractor must also have the expertise and government authorization to manage reimbursement of Russian facilities. It is deemed appropriate to award a Cost Reimburseable contract on other than a full and open competitive basis. The NAICS code is_541611, size standard of $6.0M as defined in FAR 19.101. The Draft Statement of Work (DSOW) is posted as Attachment 1.  The contractual effort is contemplated as a 5-year period of performance with an anticipated ceiling amount of $4.8M.  Approximately 60% of this ceiling is likely to be devoted to reimbursement of the Russian plants for their services in support of monitoring operations. The contract type contemplated is a Cost Plus Fixed Fee or Time and Materials Price instrument.  Work is expected to be conducted primarily at contractorâ€™s facilities, but some work may be conducted at laboratory sites. This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and regulations.  Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) shall be provided copies of the solicitation or other data subject to foreign disclosure restrictions.  Contact the Defense Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084 (1-800-353-3572) for further information on the certification process.  You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the solicitation when it is issued.

The Air Force is in the process of preparing a Justification and Approval document to gain the required approval to issue a sole source request for proposal to General Dynamics.   Suitable technical data, government data rights, or manufacturing knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended application.  Data review discloses that required data or data rights are not in the Government possession and cannot be economically obtained.  

Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1), Justification:  Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  

Subject to the Government’s consideration, a viable source, not already qualified to provide the requisite services, should submit a concise and program specific response presenting sufficient information to substantiate that they have (1) the necessary knowledge and understanding  of the requirements; 2) employees with satisfactory qualifications; and 3) appropriate repair knowledge and experience to be able to provide the services required without technical, schedule or cost risk to the ICBM and/or similar ICBM programs prior to contract award.     

A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>John Miller at 850-235-5399, or Contracting Officer Tammy Bair at 850-636-6115.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, Florida  is seeking information on Composite Lift Fans for the Landing Craft Air-Cushion (LCAC).  The application is for use on US Navy hovercraft.  This search is not restricted to current approaches or systems used in the maritime environment.  It does include any corrosion resistant lift fan technology, potentially suited for the above application used in diverse maritime as well as land environments. NSWC Panama City, is interested in materials, systems and technologies that can mitigate the physical and environmental effects that degrade lift fan blades during LCAC operations. The desired system or materials will be capable of having increased corrosion resistance and abrasion resistance over current systems, and simplified blade remove & replace procedures to levels that will increase mean time between replacement, reduce maintenance evolutions, thereby, increasing combat readiness and reducing life cycle maintenance costs and number of parts.  The weight of the systems should be kept to a minimum.   This announcement will serve as a first step for evaluating alternatives and supporting In-Service Engineering Agent  (ISEA) research and development efforts planned for fiscal years 2004-2005.  Systems could be acquired in the future for Test and Evaluation for future LCAC ISEA installation.  Both off-the-shelf and developmental approaches will be considered.   Responses to this announcement should include a technical description and detailed characteristics of the Lift Fan System for use on the Landing Craft Air-Cushion (LCAC). System descriptions should have enough information for the government to make informed decisions.  Information submitted shall be marked with restrictive legends as deemed appropriate by the potential offeror. Data with restrictive markings will be handled in accordance with the restrictions thereto.  Interested parties must provide paper submittals with copies on disks in MS Word or Adobe Acrobat format.  Information is to be received by the Government by 23  Jun 2005.  The Government will evaluate the submittals for their potential to reduce the cost of LCAC ISEA efforts.  Organizations that submit materials/designs, which are determined by the evaluation team as possessing significant potential for contributing to the solution of the LCAC Maintenance problem, may be provided an opportunity to demonstrate their system.  This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or to ultimately award a contract.  Mailing address for submissions is:  NAVSURFWARCEN, Panama City, Code XPM1, ATTN: J. Miller, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, FL 32407-7001.

<DESC>C -- Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plans Development and Implementation

Description
The USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is seeking sources capable of providing planning, design, and implementation services for Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plans (CNMP) for livestock/dairy producers in Nevada. CNMPs will be developed and certified to assist with implementation of the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP).  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS and no way obligates the government to award a contract.  

A CNMP is a grouping of conservation practices and management activities for animal feeding operations (AFOs) which, when implemented as part of a conservation system, will help ensure that both production and natural resource protection goals are achieved. A CNMP incorporates practices to 1) Use animal manure, process wastewater and other organic by-products as a beneficial resource; 2) Address potential impacts of an AFO on natural resources, including water and air quality; and 3) Assist an AFO owner/operator in meeting all applicable local, State, Federal, and Tribal water quality goals and regulations, including the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System General Permit for Agricultural Applications.
The Government anticipates a contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract and will have a one-year base period and two one-year extensions, at the option of the government.  Projects will be ordered on an as-needed basis beginning from the date of contract award.  Work under this anticipated contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders.

Task orders are expected to include civil, agricultural, and/or environmental engineering services and other services needed to develop CNMPs.  Services requested may require performing (1) field investigations; (2) engineering surveys; (3) soils investigations; (4) planning, design and construction inspection of animal waste facilities (5) preparation of the nutrient management component of a CNMP; and other activities in accordance with NRCS standards, specifications, policy, handbooks and documentation requirements as set forth in the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide, National Engineering Handbook, Agricultural Waste Management Field Handbook, National Planning Procedures Handbook, and other related references.

Technical questions should be addressed to Chuck Houston, State Conservation Engineer, telephone (775) 784-5317, e-mail chuck.houston@nv.usda.gov.     

If you are interested submit the name of your company, address, telephone number, fax number and name of contact.  FAX TO MAGGIE LIEBEL AT (775) 784-5644.  NO LATER THAN MARCH 18, 2005.  Do not email requests.

4.	have a well organized FAQ section.

The benefits calculator specifically must:
  
1.	be designed to gather information about the user’s household income and then make benefit calculations and projections based on the introduction of earned income or an increase in earned income, and where applicable, guide the user to work incentive policies that may benefit them; 
2.	be housed within the web site and contain links to information within the site;
3.	use an interview Q and A format, similar to tax preparation software;
4.	consider the information of the household to determine calculations, up to a minimum of six members;
5.	contain edits to alert the user if information about benefits input appears inconsistent with program policies;
6.	contain edits to alert the user if information provided is incomplete (e.g., calculations provided before inclusion of state-based program information, or the scenario becomes too complex for the calculator to handle).  Must clearly state the calculations are incomplete;
7.	allow the user to make projections about changes in earned income and compare scenarios by changing variables (i.e., full time vs. part time work, using a Plan to Achieve Self Support (PASS);
8.	display and provide a printed output of the scenario comparisons utilizing different formats (i.e., graph, text);
9.	provide projections of events relative to benefits on a time line of 10 years; 
10.	produce self help tools, such as a checklist to remind users of their responsibilities, alerts of upcoming program related events (i.e., SSDI benefits will end), a trial work period and extended period of eligibility tracking tool;

<DESC>For a complete description see the attached Statement of Work (SOW).


As part of the DOD Standard Procurement System, the Procurement Defense Desktop (PD²) application was selected as the standard tool for writing and administering contracts. Initial installation/deployment of the PD² application within DISA began in Jul ’98.  In 2003, the PD2 database which was physically located at the DECC in Ohio and contained data for both DITCO-Scott and DITCO-NCR was split into separate databases for each DITCO.  At the same time, the databases were moved to local locations for each DITCO and the PD2 version was upgraded to version 4.2 Increment 1.  The version has subsequently been upgraded to version 4.2 Increment 2.

The objective of this order is to procure on-site support services for daily SPS operation, maintenance and integration into the Agency’s acquisition mission.  The PD² software is continually evolving and new interfaces being built which will allow for a more seamless approach to e-business applications.  DISA intends to use PD² as the cornerstone application of the contracting process and, as such, requires functional and technical support to ensure the database remains operational and available to the contracting community.

The contractor shall comply with the appropriate DoD-approved architectures, programs, stan-dards and guidelines, such as Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) Strategic Technical Guidance (STG), Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) and Shared Data Environment (SHADE).

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to develop realistic structural fire search augmented reality simulation training for the Louis F. Garland Fire Academy, located at Goodfellow Air Force Base, TX.  Goodfellow Air Force Base is located in Tom Green County, on the southeast side of San Angelo, TX and is bounded to the north by Highway #388 (Paint Rock Rd), to the west by Fort McKavitt Rd and Bell St/Christoval Rd, to the south by Highway #1223 (San Antonio Hwy) and to the east by the eastern city limits. Work location is at the Louis F. Garland Fire Academy, Bldg 3453.

Develop a high fidelity augmented reality system providing realistic, three-dimensional images of a two-story search trainer under smoke and fire conditions.  The training model should be able to produce computer-generated hazards superimposed onto, and also anchored to, the real world.  The simulation should also include sound inputs consistent with the computer-generated hazards.

Software should be such that it provides the user with the ability to modify inputs with regards to the degree of fire, smoke, and the subsequent effect on the visibility the student has.  The user should be able to determine locations of simulated fires and smoke and these simulations should be anchored into the real world picture seen by the student.

The system should modify the standard self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) mask to be outfitted with an augmented reality (AR) display.  This modified SCBA mask with AR display must be able to communicate with the AR system via wireless communications.  This will allow the students to move around within the trainer with their partners with no hindrance.  The system will be run by an instructor/operator station to set up, control, and modify individual and team training scenarios in the search trainer.

The system will primarily provide AR support to two objectives. The first objective requires that the students, while wearing PPE and SCBA and observing all safety precautions, perform primary search procedures as a team member removing two victims from the structure, within 30 minutes, with at least 25 of 26 evaluation elements performed correctly.  The second objective requires that the students, while wearing PPE and SCBA and observing all safety precautions, perform disoriented fire fighter procedures as a team member and exit the structure within 10 minutes, with at least 7 out of 8 evaluation elements performed correctly.

The AR system should be flexible enough that the software can be modified to use the system in other rooms and allow for the use of other hazards to include chemical spills, biological contamination, nuclear/radiological accidents, and poison gas.

Contractor shall work mutually with the 312th TRS and 17th Training Support Squadron (TRSS) during implementation and testing, and provide technical support to the 17 TRSS for maintenance and upkeep of the simulation.  Contractor shall provide technical support during all phases of the project.

At this time, no solicitation exists: therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION. Be advised that funds are not presently available for this contract.

<DESC>***BACKGROUND***  The Federal Response Plan of the Department of Homeland Security designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response to man-made or natural disasters.  In 2002, HHS established the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP).  This office holds responsibility for implementation of a comprehensive HHS strategy to protect from, and be prepared to respond to, acts of bioterrorism and other public health emergencies threatening the civilian population.  The Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP has the responsibility within HHS to contract with industry for large-scale manufacturing and delivery of licensable products to the Strategic National Stockpile in preparation for response to a public health emergency.

***DESCRIPTION*** This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement.  All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned.  Bacillus anthracis is considered among the most likely biological agent threats confronting the national security of the United States.  B. anthracis is particularly effective in inducing disease when spores are released as an aerosol.  The primary mortality and morbidity of B. anthracis is mediated through a toxemia.  Antibiotics target the vegetative B. anthracis bacteria but antitoxins are necessary to neutralize the effects of the toxins and ensure a more successful therapeutic outcome.  DHHS is seeking to be advised of the availability of commercial products, or products in advanced development, for therapeutic treatments, directed at anthrax toxemia.  These products may include immunotherapeutics or small molecular entity treatments.  Data obtained from this RFI will inform DHHS’s next round of procurements for anthrax therapeutics.  Interested organizations that have candidate products are invited to submit a capability statement to the DHHS.  New respondents should submit the following information about their product: a) a description of the product including relevant chemical, physical chemical or immunological characteristics; b) a description of the mechanism of action of the product; c) a description of the proposed formulation, dosage and route of administration; d) a statement of the proposed indication for use (e.g. pre or post exposure prophylaxis or treatment); e) a statement of the proposed production process and the current state of validation or GMP compliance; f) an estimate of production capacity and timelines, and estimated cost; g) a product development plan for GMP production, animal and human studies; and h) the overall stage of product development including the current status of preclinical and clinical safety and efficacy studies; and i) timeline for submitting IND package to FDA.  Those who have responded previously need only supply updates.  All information submitted to DHHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law.

Information must be submitted by April 15, 2005.  Responses should be limited to 25 pages and are preferred in electronic format and should be e-mailed to the attention of Darrick A. Early, phone 202-401-3693, email darrick.early@hhs.gov.  

Under provisions laid out in the Project BioShield Act of 2004, future competition may be limited to sources responding to this request for information (Sec. 319F-2 (c)(7) (C)(vii) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 274d-6b).

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).   I2WD is currently conducting market research only.  No award is intended as a result of this synopsis nor does the Government intend to pay for information received.  I2WD is interested in r eceiving information on algorithms and/or techniques in development or already in existence which can be utilized for real-time processing of SAR and EO/IR imagery in support of the Eye-In-the-Sky (EIS) Army Technology Objective (ATO).  EIS will perform se nsor management and data fusion for multiple sensors aboard a common airborne platform.  Critical systems in the EIS suite include a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and an EO/IR surveillance system.  I2WD is seeking algorithms for automated target detection  and informationextraction from high-resolution (0.1m thru 1m) SAR and EO/IR imagery.  The intent of these algorithms is to provide a high probability of detection at the detection stage, followed by an information extraction stage to increase the inform ation content of each detection. Information refers to features or target classifications associated with a target that can be used to contribute to positive ID of the target. Examples might be identifying features such as wheeled vs. tracked, general f eatures such as size-class or even vehicle-type (APC vs. tank).  Such information will be used to prioritize detections for cross-cueing and increase identification confidence within a multi-sensor fusion construct. The algorithms desired should be as rob ust as possible to factors such as target aspect, clutter background and frequency band (X, Ku or Ka).  Rigorous template matching approaches conventionally employed for ATR are not the focus of this RFI. As processing power is limited for this application , it is requested that throughput requirements be considered.  Responses to this RFI should only include candidate algorithm which will be in a lab-prototype stage and ready to be tested within 6 months.  The response should include a white paper of no mor e than 10 pages describing the algorithm and results-to-date, as well as points of contact for Government sponsors, where applicable. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate to develop, implement and test the algorithm(s) for usage on a near-real-ti me airborne processor is requested.  Responses are to be received within 21 calendar days of the date of this notice.  All information must be in writing or via email, telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. You may forward respo nses to US Army, RDECOM, CERDEC, I2WD, Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: AMSRD-CER-IW-BA (Mr. Lamanna) or the following e-mail address: Peter.Lamanna@us.army.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  If you choose to submit proprietary inf ormation, mark it accordingly. Classified information will be accepted by mail only, but please mark it accordingly and send it via proper channels.  Classified information can be sent to US Army, RDECOM, CERDEC, I2WD, Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: Security Office.  The inner wrapping shall be addressed to: ATTN: AMSRD-CER-IW-BA (Mr. Lamanna).

<SUBJECT>A--Seeking suppliers to develop and produce toxin identification equipment for the Department of Defense to support the DoD Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Program, Block II effort.
<SOLNBR>W9113M-05-S-0002
<RESPDATE>031105
<ARCHDATE>05102005
<CONTACT>Susan Dell, 301-619-2383
<DESC>The Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) team, Medical Identification and Treatment Systems (MITS) Product Management Office, under the Chemical Biological Medical Systems Project Management Office in Frederick MD, is conducting a market survey of potential suppliers to develop and manufacture toxin identification equipment for the US Department of Defense. This announcement covers only the JBAIDS Block II, Phase 1, Market Survey effort to identify potential candidate systems.  Interested contractors are requested to forward potential candidate product information to identify toxins to the following address:  US Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Attn: Susan Dell, Contract Specialist, 64 Thomas Johnson Drive, Frederick MD 21702.  Responses are requested by 11 Marcy 2005.  The offeror's response needs to cover at a minimum, all nine areas noted under Phase  1 below.  After reviewing the offerors' candidate designs, selected contractors will be asked to provide system description briefings to Government officials (2-hour time limit).  In order to be eligible for contract award, a potential offeror MUST partic ipate in all four phases of the JBAIDS Block II down-selection process. It is the Government's intent to do a small business set-aside and therefore the purpose of this sources sought is to identify potential small business concerns.  This does not preclude large business concerns from responding to this notice.  The solicitat ion will be issued without restrictions if an adequate number of capable small businesses are not identified to support a set-aside. JBAIDS Block II system will add toxin identification capability to the JBAIDS program started in 2003.  The Block II program is an evolutionary enhancement to the JBAIDS Block I program, which focused on identification of Biological Warfare (BW) agents (ba cteria and viruses); JBAIDS Block I systems are currently being fielded.  As additional background, JBAIDS constitutes the Department of Defense's first effort to develop and field a common medical test equipment platform among all the military services th at will both identify BW agents, pathogens of operational concern and toxins; and be used as a diagnostic tool by medical professionals to treat patients.  US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review and clearance of the selected Block II candidate system  is planned.  A multi-block configuration development and fielding approach is proposed, as generically outline in DoD D/I 5000.1/.2. The Block II effort will begin in fiscal year (FY) 2006, under the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense, in Falls Church VA.  The proposed acquisition strategy for JBAIDS Block II will cover the selection of a commercial off-the-s helf (COTS)/Government non-development item (NDI) systems that meets the Users' operational requirements at the lowest costs, that can be fielded after a short development period for specific toxin agents of DoD interest.  The proposed competitive award pr ocess for the JBAIDS Block II engineering and manufacturing development program will follow a four-phase down selection process. Phase 1 will require prospective offerors to identify themselves in writing to the Government - Market Survey Process.  The successful offeror additionally needs to state that the offeror's company is eligible to receive a DoD Secret-Level Clearance, be ca pable of delivering test hardware within seven (7) months of contract award, and be ready to accept JBAIDS Block II Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR) upon contract award.  Also, offeror/contractor will be asked to address in writing the compan y's ability to meet the following Government provisions: 1) Has possession of a system science and methodology to identify toxins and has supporting test data to validate toxin identification performance claims. 2) Has production system or prototype system that can be available for the JBAIDS Fly-Off  test program phase in the Summer FY05 time period. 3) Has adequate access to manufacturing facility to produce hardware and reagents at a rate of at least twenty (20) systems monthly. 4) Has a production system or prototype system design (that exists or will exist in time to provide production of the initial JBAIDS requirement) that has a computer interface for storage of test results and a port to transmit the system's data to other co mputers. 5) Has knowledge of the FDA clearance process and has a plan for their candidate Block II JBAIDS design. 6) Has system manufacturing capability that can deliver the initial units within seven (7) months after contract award (ACA). 7) Has a reagent kit production facility that can produce thousands of reagent kits monthly for multiple toxins. 8) Has manufacturing production facilities that are (or their FDA plan demonstrates that their production facilities will be) FDA cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practices) certified/compliant by July 2006. 9) Has a production system or prototype system that can be delivered for development testing (assay development) within seven (7) months ACA.  (The system's man-portable, weight limit is still being defined by the DoD operational user community). In Phase 2, the Government plans to ask down-selected contractors to provide the JBAIDS program office team with a briefing (and, optionally, a written report) covering their company's ability to meet the initial screen criteria above and the company's abi lity to produce the JBAIDS development test systems and meet the JBAIDS Joint Operations Requirements Document (JORD) Block II requirements.  The target dated for briefings is early April 2005. In Phase 3, the Government plans to obtain additional information (JBAIDS Block II Technical System Description Document) regarding the offeror's ability to meet JBAIDS Block II System Performance Specification requirements through the JBAIDS Team's plans to conduct fly-off/laboratory test at Dugway Proving Grounds (DPG) in Utah, where the offeror will demonstrate performance of their COTS/NDI designs.  The target date for the fly-off is July/August 2005. In Phase 4, the Government will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to those contractors that passed the fly-off acceptance criteria.  This RFP will require the submission of a Technical Proposal, Program Master Plan/Schedule, and Pricing Information.  This  document will be issued under FAR Part 12 and 15, to select a winner using a Government Best Value continuum using FAR Part 15.101, in a formal source selection.  The contract award is targeted for early January/February 2006.

<SUBJECT>Z--Army Residential Communities Initiative RCI - Sources Sought Notice for Privatization of Army Family Housing at Fort Myer Military Community FMMC, which includes Fort Myer in Arlington, VA and Fort McNair in Washington DC.
<SOLNBR>W912DR-05-R-0025
<RESPDATE>040105
<ARCHDATE>05312005
<CONTACT>joseph.neil, 301-677-3007
<DESC>The Armys Residential Communities Initiative RCI is seeking interested parties to accomplish the Privatization of Army Family Housing at Fort Myer Military Community FMMC, which includes Fort Myer in Arlington, VA and Fort McNair in Washington DC. Previously, the Army issued a Request for Information RFI to determine the type and depth of industry interest in the privatization of Army Family Housing at the Fort Myer Military Community FMMC.  This addendum was motivated by respondents to the previous  RFI who requested additional information so they could provide a more definitive reply.  The additional information is provided in Attachment 1 to this addendum.  When replying to this addendum, respondents are requested to include a brief opinion on how they will meet the requirements of Section 2875 of Title 10 of the United States Code  Investments of the Military Housing Privatization Initiative MHPI as related to Forts Myer and McNair.  Section 2875 MHPI is further explained below.  Respondents may a lso choose to propose alternative project structures not subject to Section 2875 restrictions.  The FMMC is a garrison command that serves two higher headquarters and that grew out of the Military District of Washington MDW in 1993.  Forts Myer and McNair are historic installations that have performed many functions in their long lives, but for the l ast half-century they have served as the Army's Showcase in the National Capital Region.  Army family housing at Fort McNair includes 29 historic family housing units.  Army family housing at Fort Myer includes 178 family housing units, comprised of 118 no n-historic homes and 60 historic homes.  The land and units belonging to the 118 non-historic homes -Tencza Terrace high rise- will not be included in this project.  For purposes of determining feasibility, interested parties should assume that the project  consists of the 60 historic homes at Fort Myer and the 29 historic homes at Fort McNair. Firms with experience in historic preservation, historic tax credits, residential construction, operation, and management are encouraged to recommend means by which this project could be accomplished while still meeting the requirements in Section 2875.  T he Army seeks firms whose innovative approach to financing and organizational structure will optimize the community development and management plan while not exceeding the 2875 test.  Respondents should assume that use of a Government direct loan will not be available.   Explanation of Section 2875  Investments of the Military Housing Privatization Initiative MHPI.  Congress, through MHPI, granted the Government the authority to be a partner in a Limited Liability Company LLC pursuing privatization through an investment i n such an entity.  Many RCI projects need a Government equity contribution in order to fill a development funding gap during the Initial Development Period IDP.  Typically, the Government supplies its equity investment as an interest in the project LLC.  S ection 2875  Investments of the MHPI legislative authorities state that, 'the cash amount of an investment under this section in an eligible entity may not exceed an amount equal to 33% of the capital cost of the project or projects that the eligible enti ty proposes to carry out under this section with the investment.'  When the investment involves land and facilities, the total value of the investment cannot exceed 45% of the capital cost of the project.  The statute provides that 'the term 'capital cost' , with respect to a project for the acquisition or construction of housing, means the total amount of the costs included in the basis of the housing for Federal income tax purposes.'   Consequently, in addition to the costs that the partnership expends in development of the assets and creation of new assets, the basis of the project, and therefore the capital cost of the project, must also include the adjusted basis of the assets contributed by the Governme nt at the time of the contribution.    Interested parties are invited to provide their written opinion of the options to privatize Army family housing at FMMC while remaining within the allowed authorities and excluding the non-historic homes.  Responses -ten pages or less- should also include the company name, a brief statement of relevant corporate background statement of capabilities as it relates to low-rise 3 story or less housing development/construction, property management and project financing, point of contact, telephone number and ema il address, to the Contract Specialist via email at tracy.fetchik@usace.army.mil by no later than 1 April 2005.   This announcement constitutes a sources sought / market research synopsis and will close on 1 April 2005.  Information obtained as a result of this announcement is for planning purposes only and may or may not be used for a subsequent solicitation.

<DESC>CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS      U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg Consolidated Contracting Office (VCCO), Service and Supply Branch, 4155 East Clay Street, Vicksburg, MS, 39183-3435 Description THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE.  THIS REQUIREMENT HAS NOT BEEN SET-ASIDE FOR ANY PARTICULAR SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM.  For information purposes, the DRAFT Statement of W ork will be available online at ftp://ftp.mvk.usace.army.mil/pub/MS%20LAKES%20O&M/MS%20LAKES%20STATEMENT%20OF%20WORK.pdf .  The solicitation number for this announcement is W912EE-05-R-0006.  VCCO solicits for Capability Statements from all qualified and i nterested HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, and 8(a) small business firms to participate in a Best Value solicitation for operation, maintenance, and repair of flood control facilities managed by the Corps of Engineers at either one or both of the f ollowing projects (separate contracts will be awarded for each project): 1.  Arkabutla, Sardis, Enid, and Grenada Lakes in the State of Mississippi (MS LAKES) and/or 2. Ouachita, Greeson, and Degray Lakes in the State of Arkansas (ARK LAKES).  Both project s are nearly identical in the type, complexity, and variety of work required.  Only the MS LAKES project Statement of Work is available online at this time.  The main difference between the two projects is the amount of work required.  The MS LAKES project  has historically averaged between $5 and $6 Million per year, while the ARK LAKES project averages between $1.5 to $2.5 Million per year.  Unless otherwise noted, all descriptions below refer to either of the projects.  The NAICS Code for both proposed ac quisitions is 561210, Facilities (except computer operation) support services, and the small business size standard is $30 Mil.  Federal Supply Code is Z299, Maintenance, repair/alteration/all other.  Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have th e capability to perform at least 50% of the contract work with his-or-her own employees.  The Government will use responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT synopsis to make appropriate acquisition decisions to solicit these projects as either HubZone, Service Disab led Veteran Owned, 8(a), or small business set-asides.  Proposals will be evaluated using a Best Value source selection process that will result in award of a cost-plus-award-fee contract to the responsive responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, offers the Best Value to the Government, technical, past performance, and cost considered.  The Government anticipates awarding a contract for one base year and four option years.  The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements as indicated in the Statement of Work to submit Capability Statements consisting of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and past performance references.  Respondents must include references and a capability statement for at least two completed or current projects, for which your firm was the prime contractor (or a major subcontractor) within the last three years of work similar in size, scope and complexity.  Each reference shall include cont act names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, contract numbers as well as a description of the services provided, contract type (i.e., fixed price or cost), and dollar value.  Proof of SBA certification for 8(a) and/or HubZone status must also be inclu ded.  Respondents must indicate in their cover letter the project for which they are submitting (MS LAKES OR ARK LAKES), and if for both, only one submittal is required. The Capabilities Statement for this sources sought is not expected to be a proposal, but rather short statements regarding the companys ability to demonstrate existing or developed expertise and experience in relation to the areas specified in the Stateme nt of Work.  Any commer cial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the Capabilities Statement.  Submission of a Capabilities Statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the VCCO in tailor ing requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is neither to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  After completing its analysis, the Government will determine whether to limit competition among HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran, or 8(a) firms or proceed with competition among all small business fi rms.  Submissions that do not meet all requirements or submit within the allotted time will not be considered.  Electronic submissions via email will be accepted, facsimile submissions will not. Responses to this Sources Sought may be emailed to Jack Littl e at jack.a.little@mvk02.usace.army.mil or mailed to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg Consolidated Contracting Office, ATTN: Jack Little, 4155 East Clay Street, Vicksburg, MS, 39183-3435.

<SUBJECT>70--eCognition software
<DESC>The Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Mid-Pacific Region, Sacramento, California has a requirement for eCognition software, a commercial, a PC-based object-oriented remote-sensing software, 1 year of annual support and updates of our current eCognition license and an eCognition Hardlock upgrade. Reclamation performs a variety of satellite image processing (remote sensing) in support of numerous projects and applications to include the Lower Colorado River Accounting System, cooperative agricultural database projects in the State of California and Arizona, the Land-Atmosphere-Water-Simulator Project and the Central Valley Habitat Monitoring Program.   The purpose of this notice is to announce the intent to issue a purchase order on a firm, fixed-price, sole-source basis to PCI Geomatics, 480 B Tennyson Pl., Victoria, BC, Canada V8Z 6S8 in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b) - Soliciting competition and FAR Part 12.6 - Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   Our market research indicates that PCI Geomatics is the sole distributor of eCognition software in North America.   A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  It has been determined that in addition to PCI Geomatics being the sole distributor in North America, award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs to convert to another vendor's system to include software and hardware engineering efforts to integrate with other test equipment, additional development and documentation costs, unacceptable delays and other unnecessary additional costs in fulfilling the agency's requirement that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Continued use of this software is essential and critical to the Agency's mission.   This total value of this requirement is estimated at less than $25,000.00.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 511210, and the size standard is $21,000.000.00.  This notice will be the only official notice prior to award of the purchase order.  Anticipated award date is March 1, 2005.   This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only, however, any firm that believes that it can furnish the items described above is encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting documentation must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to provide the above items.   All information received by the close of business (5:30 p.m. PST), February 28, 2005 will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries and concerns must be addressed to Benjamin C.K. Weston either via fax at (916) 978-5182, or e-mail @ (bweston@mp.usbr.gov) (include "eCognition software" in the SUBJECT field).  At a minimum, responses must include the firm's name, contact information, business size (e.g., small business, other than small business) in accordance with the size standard for NAICS code 511210, and concise description of similar items to the requirement described above.   TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-05-Q-625471 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and offers being requested.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is small business set-aside procurement.    The NAICS is 721110.
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.
