<DESC><p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">The MACC program represents a multiple award construction acquisition for design and construction activities at TAFB. Indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) firm fixed price contracts will be awarded to up to six contractors who illustrate their comprehensive understanding of the statement of work (SOW) and adherence to the terms and conditions presented in the solicitation. The MACC contracts will be for one basic year with four, one-year options. Individual project scopes shall be awarded in compliance with Fair Opportunity requirements of the solicitaion as task orders against the basic contract. The MACC program has a cumulative value for all basic contracts awarded not to exceed $100 million.</p>
<p>Work shall consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and may involve design services for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair, alteration, and minor construction projects affecting real property at TAFB. The contractors shall provide diversified design-build or construction only services and activities to support those designs, including Value Engineering (VE) and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED<sup>TM</sup>) analyses.</p>

<p>Electronic procedure will be used for this solicitation. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source require acquisition of the part from the approved soruces. An alternate source must qualify IAW the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources. Current qualified source is Pratt &amp; Whitney (52661). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. All proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.<br />It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. <br />Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.<br />Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other<br />restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Request for Written Quotation will be issued. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty five-days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.</p>
<p>AWARD WILL NOT BE WITHHELD AWAITING QUALIFICATION. For qualification information/source approval requests contact OC-ALC/BC, 3001 Staff Drive, Ste #1AC85A, Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3009.</p>

In compliance with the Command’s Initiative to enhance Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) for shipboard applications, the only technically acceptable item which has (ILS) support is the Audio Booth manufactured by Industrial Acoustics Company.  IAC has repeatedly demonstrated that their product is the only one that can provide the service the US Navy requires.  This booth has been designed to fit into a very small area.

This is the only booth that meets the specifications on board the USS Boxer.  It has been determined that no other manufacturer makes an Audio Booth to these specifications.   
  
This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 332311 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable maintenance is provided by Industrial Acoustics Company.

Submit email capability statements (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Christina Boyd-Brown at christina.boyd-brown@med.navy.mil. Fax quotes may be sent to 301-619-1132 Attn: Christina Boyd-Brown. Email statements are preferred. Statements are due not later than 4:00 P.M. EST on 11 May 2009.  No phone calls accepted.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to negotiate a contract with W.A. Wilde Company.
<p>This procurement is for a contract for services of W.A. Wilde, Company to mail letters of invitation to potential participants of the Nurses' Health Study III. This involves completing the following tasks: 1) merge name and address information onto letters, 2) procure postage to mail materials. This procurement is associated with the current contract numbers 211-2008-M-24365 with Brigham and Women's Hospital and 254-2008-M-26510 with W.A. Wilde, Company.</p>
<p>The NHS-III will invite one million nurses, nationally, to participate in the study. Approximately 200,000 letters and emails will be sent to existing participants of the NHS I and NHS II to launch the viral method. Additionally, approximately 700,000 paper questionnaires will be sent to nurses in select states who meet the eligibility requirements of the NHS-III. NIOSH will contribute to the funding of 250,000 of these mailings.</p>
<p>CDC/NIOSH has procured funding through NORA to contribute towards a percentage of the mailing costs for the NHS-III. Because Brigham Women's Hospital has chosen W.A. Wilde Company for their mailing needs, and because W.A. Wilde Company already has the addresses in house, in addition to the fact that CDC/NIOSH is only funding a portion of the mailing (approximately 40%). If CDC/NIOSH were to compete this task to other mailing houses, the task would be severed into two, resulting in substantial duplication of costs that would be unrecoverable through competition.</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to W.A. Wilde Company under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward product and pricing information to&nbsp;Florence Black, Contract Specialist, Procurement and Grant Branch-V (Pittsburgh), PO Box 18070, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA, 15236-0070; email <a href="mailto:fbb4@cdc.gov">fbb4@cdc.gov</a>. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all product and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, negotiations will be conducted with W.A. Wilde Company, 200 Summer St., Holliston MA 01746 as the only source.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><br />Phase 3: HCQIS Adhoc Reports, Analytics, and Data Management</p>
<p>The HealthCare Quality Information System (HCQIS) is a major application environment that uses application groups, shared servers, and WAN to monitor and improve utilization and quality of care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. HCQIS is composed of 5 application groups:</p>
<p>&bull; Standard Data Processing System (SDPS) for Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), including the Clinical Data Abstraction Center (CDAC);</p>
<p>&bull; Value Based Purchasing (VBP) IT Infrastructure for Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) and Hospital Outpatient;</p>
<p>&bull; Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-Enabled Network (CROWNWeb);</p>
<p>&bull; Quality Improvement and Evaluation System (QIES) for states and CMS;</p>
<p>&bull; Quality Improvement Initiatives (QII)</p>
<p>This statement of work is related to Adhoc Reports, Analytics, and Data Management for the SDPS and VBP application groups and is phase 3, of a 4-phase process. The other phases will be issued as separate solicitations with their specific SOW, requirements, evaluation criteria, etc. The Government estimates that it will issue these separate solicitations during 2008-2009. This information is being provided as informational only and it does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. The four Phases that currently being developed are:</p>
<p>Phase 1 - Program Management and Business Requirement Contract (PMBR)<br />Phase 2 - Infrastructure Contract<br />Phase 3 - Adhoc Reports, Analytics, and Data Management Contract (Current Solicitation)<br />Phase 4 - Development Contract</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Standard Data Processing System (SDPS), implemented in 1997, supports the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) program and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) community. Prior to SDPS, each QIO was responsible for developing solutions to meet the management and reporting requirements of the Statement of Work (SoW). Besides the obvious inefficiencies of redundant systems and costs, each QIO had different competencies during that period. Since the inception of SDPS, its functions have encompassed support, standardization and development of data, software and standards for the QIO community. SDPS continues to rapidly evolve with innovative technology to meet the challenges of supporting and interfacing directly with the QIO community and surrounding healthcare industry.</p>
<p>Quality Improvement Organizations (QIO) are under contract by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to</p>
<p>&bull; Improve quality of care for beneficiaries;</p>
<p>&bull; Protect the integrity of the Medicare Trust Fund by ensuring that Medicare pays only for services and goods that are reasonable and medically necessary and that are provided in the most appropriate setting; and</p>
<p>&bull; Protect beneficiaries by expeditiously addressing individual complaints, notices, and appeals, such as beneficiary complaints; provider-issued notices of non-coverage (Hospital-Issued Notice of Non-Coverage [HINN], Notice of Discharge and Medicare Appeal Rights [NODMAR], and Medicare Advantage appeal); Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) violations; and other related statutory QIO responsibilities.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for the QIO Statement of Work is found in Part B of Title XI of the Social Security Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act), as amended by the Peer Review Improvement Act of 1982. The Act established the Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization Program, now known as the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) Program.</p>
<p>The statutory mission of the Program, as set forth in Section 1862(g) of the Act, is to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, economy, and quality of services delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p>In support of the QIO program, CMS authorized the design and implementation of a SDPS for the User Community. SDPS is an information system solution that provides a common platform for users to share applications and data to promote efficiency and increase productivity. SDPS is the QIO Information Technology and data support infrastructure.</p>
<p>The SDPS User Community, for purposes of this contract, refers to the QIOs, the State Agencies, CMS Central and Regional Offices, the Clinical Data Abstraction Center (CDAC), and other organizations/partners that may be incorporated in support of CMS initiatives. This system services the daily, ongoing support that the SDPS User Community needs to fulfill their contractual requirements in a manner supportive of an ongoing quality improvement program.</p>
<p>The VBP application group utilizes SDPS applications and warehouses in addition to other VBP specific products. These applications and warehouses support two provisions of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA) Division B, Title 1:</p>
<p>1. Section 101, Physician Payment and Quality Improvement, includes The Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI). This law authorizes a financial incentive for eligible professionals to participate in a voluntary quality reporting program. Eligible professionals, who choose to participate and successfully report on a designated set of quality measures for services paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and provided between July 1 and December 31, 2007 to Medicare beneficiaries under the traditional fee-for-service program, may earn a bonus payment of 1.5% of their charges during that period, subject to a cap.</p>
<p>On December 29, 2007, the President signed Public Law 110-173, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (MMSEA), which authorized the continuation of the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) for 2008. The 2008 PQRI reporting period is January 1-December 31, 2008.</p>
<p>The Extension Act also provides new authorities for enhancing PQRI that CMS will be implementing during 2008.

<DESC><p>DARPA seeks innovative proposals that address the development of antenna coupled infrared detectors operating at room temperature and sensitive in the 3-5um spectral band, and the design and fabrication of large area, high density focal plane arrays (FPAs) based upon the antenna coupled detectors.  The program addresses technology to establish the feasibility of antenna coupled detectors with pixel linear dimension equal to the detected wavelength, 5 um; the interconnection of these small size devices to read-out integrated circuits; and imaging demonstrations with large area arrays, 2048x2048 elements.    The technology is based upon collecting infrared radiation with an antenna at each pixel, and coupling the infrared radiation into a semiconductor device with response at the frequency of the radiation.  The program integrates expertise in optical micro-antenna and high speed semiconductor technologies with the infrared detection and focal plane technologies, and the development of state of the art infrared imaging arrays.  The integration of these technologies results in an imaging array with unique attributes, establishing a new paradigm for infrared imaging.  All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to DARPA-BAA-09-48@darpa.mil.

<CONTACT>David - Kordel, Email david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>Requisition Number: FDA1054781

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeks a 100% small business set-aside for access to a medical drug database.   Award will be a firm-fixed price purchase order.

Background:  The FDA requires the procurement of a Medi-Span Master Drug Database v2.5 (MDDB®) with 5 user licenses within one of our laboratories located in Rockville, MD.  The FDA will use MDDB® to insure accuracy of data entry, completeness of drug product data, reconciliation of drug product status and in identification of drug products not known to the FDA.  Through a process of coding, safeguards shall be in place that insure integrity and preservation of data entered to satisfy 21 CFR 207.  FDA requires access to relevant data for purposes of identifying marketed drug products in support of multiple agency programs and activities, expressly including use of such data to prepare reports, lists, or other information identifying marketed drug products to respond to inquiries from, or that may otherwise be shared with other governmental entities or the public.

Requirements: 

1. The Contractor and product must support the following:
a.   On-line searchable, sortable prescription drug product file.
b.   Ten or more years plus in compiling drug product related data for those drug products in the commercial marketplace.
c.   Ability to obtain new drug product listings and discontinue drug product listings that are no longer on the marketplace on a timely basis using a monitored process. 
d.   Adds all newly approved FDA products.
e.   Coded method of identifying which drugs are FDA approved (NDAs and ANDAs), pre-1962, etc. and which are not.
f.   Comprehensive, complete, and accurately identified compiling of prescription drug products on the commercial marketplace, referenced by NDC# and manufacturer, distributer, re-labeler or re-packager name and address plus other value added descriptors.
g.   Combines a comprehensive set of drug data base elements, drug pricing and clinical information with multiple types of unique drug identifiers to provide flexibility in representing drug products, enhancing drug product identity and tracking drug related information. 
h.   Product must be an accurate and comprehensive drug products file which includes at least 95% of all prescription drug products on the commercial marketplace. 
i.   Must include all variations of a drug product’s packaging (package codes) and updates all on-line files with 30 days of FDA approval.
j.   Reliable data regarding manufacturers, distributors, relabelers, and repackagers and their contact information so that DRLS has an accurate, up to date list of the industry involved in all facets of the drug product supply chain.
k.   Provides means to determine new drug products which have been added since the previous update.
l.   Includes an Over-the-Counter Drug List option.
m.   Identification of both FDA approved and unapproved prescription drug products.  On June 19, 2006, the FDA Commissioner appointed an Unapproved Drug Coordinator to help firms identify the steps they must take to obtain approval of their marketed unapproved drugs.  With this stepped-up focus, in June 2006, demands for expertise in the unapproved drugs and DESI area increased significantly. 
2.  Contractor Tasks / Requirements.

<DESC>INTENT
The National Guard Bureau (Guard), Arlington, VA, intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the Contractor proposing the best value solution to fulfill the needs of the Government.

ACQUISITON OBJECTIVE
The objective of this acquisition is to obtain a man-portable, multi-band system that can receive in real time and transmit in near real time.

The ideal system shall receive, simultaneously from multiple sources, full motion video, imagery, and other sensory data.  Through the use of compression technology and digital content management solutions, the system will capture, standardize, process and fuse video, images and data input and securely transmit that product to all users.  The system will have the ability to provide (real-time) video, digital imagery, and other sensory data directly to end users and, more importantly, transmit that data with minimal latency.  

The system will be a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) turn-key system that can receive and transmit analog and digital signals from all types of sensors.  The receiver system must be built to withstand extreme and/or austere environments (natural disasters and national emergencies) and “man-portable” (light-weight and mobile).  The proposed receiver system must operate independently of local infrastructure and be compatible with SATCOM, the Global Broadcast System or existing local T1 connection.  

BACKGROUND:
The National Guard conducts real-time video assessment and digital imagery collection for a host of users including incident commanders, first-responders, state and local leadership, federal partners and national-level leadership including the President.  Real-time full motion video (FMV) that can be processed, exploited, and distributed (PED) is widely considered the best operational intelligence support available for effectively deploying forces and responding to continually evolving circumstances during a crisis.  

The product resulting from this award will improve the Guard’s ability to effectively and efficiently collect video signals from the array of available aerial imagery collectors and disseminate those images to incident commanders in a domestic environment.  As demonstrated by hurricanes in Louisiana and wild fires in California, a shared understanding of a situation is critical to effective emergency response. 

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  As part of the Guard’s Concept of Operation, this capability will be deployed to each of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) ten regions in this order:  IV, VI, III, IX, II, X, VIII, V, I, II, and VII.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with Denton Vacuum, LLC, Moorestown, New Jersey, for an upgrade of a Denton Vacuum Infinity 22 Thermal Evaporator to an Infinity 22 Electron-Beam Evaporator

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.

(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in –

(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST CNST NanoFab currently uses an existing Denton Vacuum Infinity 22 Electron-Beam Evaporator.  The NIST CNST NanoFab has a need to increase its electron beam deposition capability.  Electron beam deposition is a commonly used means of applying thin films (metals and other materials) onto nearly all the nanostructures developed by NIST CNST researchers.  The NIST CNST NanoFab has a need for a second Electron-Beam Evaporator.  NIST CNST NanoFab has an existing Denton Vacuum Infinity 22 Thermal Evaporator.  Therefore, NIST CNST will convert the Denton Thermal Evaporator to an Electron-Beam Evaporator.  The intent of this procurement is to exactly duplicate an existing tool in the CNST NanoFab with the specification that all the processes developed on one tool can be seamlessly transferred to the other.  In order to ensure that requirement, all components, hardware and software, have to be exactly identical on both tools once the upgrade is completed.  The electron-beam evaporator relies on software proprietary to Denton Vacuum to provide the necessary communication between the electronic controllers and the actuators (electron gun, power supplies, crystal monitor, sweep units, pumps, interlocks, valves, shutters, etc.).  As a result, Denton Vacuum, LLC, is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government’s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333994, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by May 8, 2009, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Additionally, Battelle Memorial Institute manufactures the Battelle systems are calibrated with gas standards that are traceable to World Meteorological Organization (WMO) standards. This is a strict requirement for all NOAA CO2 observing systems so that our measurements can be referenced back to the global observing network. There are no other systems available commercially that can be calibrated with these standard gases. Furthermore, said systems are part of an ongoing network of autonomous systems. These systems have to be swapped out once per year to maintain a continuous measurement record. The new systems, therefore, must have the same dimensions and design specifications to work in the platforms that are already deployed in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.</p>
<p>All interested parties must respond to this announcement by May 11,2009. Responses must include the contractor's name, contact information, and information indicating the contractor's capability to provide the required pCO2 monitors.

Any response that does not include this information will not be considered. The Government will evaluate each response to determine if the contractor has the experience, knowledge and capability to provide the proprietary specifications. No solicitation is available at this time.</p>
<p>All contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov/. In addition, completion of the online representation and certifications application (ORCA) is required. The applicable NAICS is 334519 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.
The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division intends to enter into a Firm Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Canadian Commercial Corporation (ELCAN Optical Technologies as the primary subcontractor), 396 Leitz Rd., Midland, Ontario, Canada L4R 5B8.  This requirement is for the acquisition of Enhanced Combat Optical Sights (ECOS) SU-230/PVS and SU-230/PVS Version A on behalf of the Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) program.  The optical sights are considered commercial items and have been fielded to USSOCOM Special Operations Forces since 2006 based upon specific configurations from Engineering Changes and positive feedback from Developmental and Operational Testing.  The ELCAN SU-230/PVS series sights were approved for procurement and fielding by USSOCOM Acquisition Decision Memorandum and Fielding and Deployment Release in May 2006.  
The SU-230/PVS (5.56mm) and SU-230A/PVS (7.62mm) are optical sights that provide the shooter with the capability of selecting between two fields-of-view.  The first option is a 1X (reflex type) sight with a 26 degree field-of-view.  This magnification together with a red dot illuminated reticle provides the shooter with an extremely fast, "both eyes open," target acquisition, close combat sight.  The second option is a 4X magnified sight with a 6.5 degree field-of-view.  This magnification provides the shooter with long-range target identification and precision marksmanship capability out to 600 meters using a bullet drop compensation reticle.  These two different fields-of-view, in one housing, are easily and quickly interchanged by means of a lever mounted on the side of the optical housing.  The ballistically compensated reticle is illuminated by means of a high efficiency resonant cavity red light emitting diode (LED).  When turned in one direction, the reticle illuminat! ion switch provides five different illumination levels of a "red dot" aiming mark.  The red dot helps attract the eye to precise point of aim and bullet impact.  Opposite rotation direction switch provides five levels of illumination of whole reticle, allowing dawn, dusk, and night shooting of sight.  Both of these LED settings have levels that are compatible with image intensified night vision equipment.  A throw-lever-type mount allows for attachment of the sight to a MIL-STD-1913 rail.  This lever system provides accurate zero retention when sight is repeatedly removed and replaced on the rail.  The SU-230/PVS series sights have the following features that were specified by SOF operators:  addition of backup iron sights at three locations, addition of Miniature Reflex Sight attachment points for emergency close quarter battle sighting, changes to the battery cap for gloved and night time use, surface improvements on switches, optimization of switch rotation torque, chang! es to the field of view switch to prevent accidental activation or point-of-aim shifts, standardization of reticles for 5.56mm and 7.62mm ballistic compensations, change of position of throw levers for improved compatibility with the M4, flat dark earth color change for system compatibility, position change of windage mechanism for improved operational effectiveness, changes to the lens cover for standardization and improved effectiveness, and incorporation of standard User Identification Labels.
The proposed action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), only one responsible source.  The proposed IDIQ is a follow-on procurement for the sustainment of existing enhanced optical sights.   A sole source requirement is essential for meeting program criteria, delivery schedules and mission critical quality requirements.  
The proposed IDIQ contract will have a five (5) year ordering period for the sustainment of ECOS for the SOPMOD program.  The contract minimum quantities are 10 ea. with an estimated maximum amount of 26,000 ea. over a five year period.  This contract will also include a line item for repairs. 
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No formal solicitation will be issued.

As a result of findings from Operational and Developmental Testing, the following Engineering Changes were incorporated into the contract to improve suitability and effectiveness and to integrate the AN/PVS-24 into the system:   changes to the focus knob range for improved long and short range shooting, changes to the throw lever design, incorporation of an accessory hood that is optimized for use with the SU-230/PVS and SU-231/PEQ sights, incorporation of flat dark earth color, improvements to the battery spring for increased durability, optimization of the low battery indicator, and incorporation of standard User Identification Labels. The proposed action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), only one responsible source.  The proposed IDIQ is a follow-on procurement for the sustainment of existing CNVD-I devices.   A sole source requirement is essential for meeting program criteria, delivery schedules and mission critical quality requirements.     
The proposed IDIQ contract will have a five (5) year ordering period for the sustainment of CNVD-I's for the SOPMOD program.  The contract minimum quantities are 10 ea. with an estimated maximum amount of 10,000 ea. over a five year period. This contract will also include a line item for repairs.
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No formal solicitation will be issued.  It should be noted however that NSWC Crane is the process of finalizing a competitive procurement package that will be released in the mid summer timeframe with a planned 2010 award.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.
The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division intends to enter into a Firm Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Daniel Defense, 6002 Commerce Blvd., Savannah, GA 31408.  This requirement is for the acquisition of a Monolithic MIL-STD-1913 Rail Interface System on behalf of the Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) program.  The Rail Interface system is considered a commercial item and has been fielded to USSOCOM Special Operations Forces since 2006 based upon specific configurations from Engineering Changes and positive feedback from Developmental and Operational Testing.  The Daniel Defense Rail Interface System was approved for procurement and fielding by USSOCOM Acquisition Decision Memorandum and Fielding and Deployment Release in May 2006.  The Daniel Defense Rail Interface System is a monolithic MIL-STD-1913 rail interface system.  The RIS II allows the barrel of the M4A1 Carbine to free-float.  Such a rail system was desired so that operators could realize the full potential of their aiming accessories, eliminating the effects of barrel vibration.  There are six available variants of the RIS II.  Each RIS II variant has been designed for use with a particular barrel length and the presence/absence of a fixed, front sight post.  Additionally, the Daniel Defense RIS II contains an integral M203 mounting interface.  
The proposed action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), only one responsible source.  The proposed IDIQ is a follow-on procurement for the sustainment of an existing Rail Interface system.   A sole source requirement is essential for meeting program criteria, delivery schedules and mission critical quality requirements.     

The proposed IDIQ contract will have a five (5) year ordering period for the sustainment of a RIS for the SOPMOD program.  The contract minimum quantities are 50 ea. with an estimated maximum amount of 27,000 ea. over a five year period.  This action will also include a line item for repairs. 
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No formal solicitation will be issued.

<DESC>The FISC Norfolk, Philadelphia Division intends to acquire, on a sole source basis, continued base operation support services on behalf of the NAVICP Philadelphia and Mechanicsburg representing the interests of the U.S. Navy (USN).  This is a requirement for a contractor to provide base and supply receiving, postal and mail room operations, property accounting and Classified Naval Messaging and Support.
These support services are currently being performed by Systems Support Alternatives, Inc. under FISC Contract N00140-04-C-D902 which was competitively awarded as a small business set-aside. This is a firm fixed price type contract with a period of performance through 31 May 2009. 
Due to unforeseen changes with required support capabilities additional time was required to prepare a new performance work statement and competitive solicitation. It is estimated that approximately four months will be added to the contract in order to provide continuing services while a competitive solicitation is prepared and conducted. The period of performance of the contract is expected to extend from 1 June 2009 thru 30 September 2009.
It is further anticipated that a competitive solicitation will be issued in the near future for base and supply receiving, postal and mail room operations, property accounting and Classified Naval Messaging and Support..  The new contract would take over after completion of the current contract.
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contracting action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Program Support Center, on behalf of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) intends to award a sole source contract to Nitor Group, Ltd. , Chester, MD, to provide support services to develop a strategy, program governance, technical requirements, program artifacts, and facilitation processes that will move the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) to production readiness and production status in order to move the Country toward the goal of assuring that every American has an electronic health record by 2014 and that the country is provided with a means to exchange health information. The current acquisition is to provide expertise to enable ONC to bridge to a full and open competition during the last part of 2009. This latter competition will result in the selection of a set of task order contractors which will provide the range of skills, knowledge, and experience to advance the work toward a full production NHIN. 

The ONC provides leadership for the development and implementation of an interoperable health IT infrastructure to improve the quality and efficiency of health care and the ability of consumers to manage their own health care. To achieve this goal, the NHIN is being developed to provide a secure, nationwide, interoperable health information infrastructure that will connect providers, consumers, and others involved in supporting health and health care. This critical part of the national health IT agenda will enable health information to follow the consumer, be available for clinical decision making, and support appropriate use of healthcare information beyond direct patient care so as to improve public health generally. Title XIII of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), entitled Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), mandates that by 2014 each person in the United States will be able to utilize an electronic health record; to achieve this goal, the statute directs the National Coordinator of Health Information Technology to develop a nationwide health information technology infrastructure that allows for the electronic use and exchange of information. To meet these legislative mandates, a range of programmatic, management, architecture and infrastructure expertise is needed to ensure the timely, appropriate, efficient, purposeful conduct of activities by current and future participants on the Nationwide Health Information Network, consistent with ARRA.

The current award is being made as a sole source contract to assure that work of the ONC toward the national NHIN is not impaired while the agency prepares documentation to enable a full and open competition for the range of work necessary, to take place. A sole source contractor is being chosen at this time who has the requisite skill, knowledge, and direct relevant experience so as to fulfill this short term goal. In the competitive acquisition to be conducted this fall the contractors selected will need to provide specialized expertise to develop systems, procedures, and technical artifacts. Specific activities may include assisting ONC:
•	developing a strategy and governance structure to fulfill the vision for the NHIN, including the steps necessary to move the NHIN to production status; 
•	evaluating, planning, implementing and deploying health information technology, with special emphasis on information networks and interoperability;
•	developing a portfolio to manage the assets, resources, and other materials related to the NHIN;
•	guiding and overseeing stakeholder and workgroup activities; and 
•	leading a communications campaign which includes effective news messaging and communications, establishing/maintaining a product web site and method of outreach to those interested in learning more about the NHIN or coming into production.

Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of Far 6.302-1.  Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement that demonstrates their ability to provide the services required. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.

<DESC>RECOVERY:  PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR THE GEORGE C. YOUNG COURTHOUSE FEDERAL BUILDING, ORLANDO, FLORIDA, SOLICITATION NO. GS-04P-09-EX-C-0078.  This procurement is advertised on an unrestricted basis.  The Real Estate, Design and Construction Organization in the Southeast Sunbelt Region of Public Buildings Services of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is presently soliciting proposals from qualified Offerors desiring to compete in the procurement process for the subject construction project.  This project is funded from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA.)  The project delivery method being used is the Construction Manager as-Constructor (herein referred to as CMc). The contract type is Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP).  A Construction Manager as-Constructor provides Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work.  GSA intends to contract for Design Phase Services with an option for Construction Phase Work for a major modernization of the George C. Young Courthouse Federal Building in Orlando, Florida, with the CMc that offers the best overall value to the Government.  Design Phase Services are expected to commence upon award of the contract on or about August 2009.  The Optional Construction Phase Work is anticipated to be exercised on or about March 2010 with an anticipated performance period of 1095 calendar days. The CMc is required to complete the Design Phase Services for the firm-fixed-price presented in the procurement process.  At any time during or after Design Phase Services, the Contracting Officer may request the CMc to provide a firm-fixed-price proposal for the Construction Phase Work.    

The George C. Young Courthouse Federal Building contains 188,588 gross square feet and is 6 stories tall.  The building has no interior parking, as that was lost due to the tunnel connector to the new attached Annex.  There is a 100+ parking structure on site built as part of the Annex project. The George C. Young Courthouse Federal Building currently houses the U.S. District Court, Magistrate Court,  U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Attorney, Social Security, GSA-PBS, GSA-FSS, FBI, DHS-FPS, Probation and Public Defender.

The George C. Young Courthouse Federal Building is located at 401 W Central Blvd, Orlando, FL 32801.  The guaranteed maximum price for this project is $35,000,000 million for combined services (Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work.).  The North American Industry Classification System Code(s) (NAICS) for this procurement is 236220.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-Step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures.  

Design has not started on this project.  It is anticipated that this CMc contract and the contract for architectural and engineering will be awarded in the same timeframe.  There are two components of work to be performed under this Contract:  Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work.  The Construction Phase Work is an option.  The CMc is required to complete the Design Phase Services for the firm-fixed-price presented during the procurement process.  At any time during or after Design Phase Services, the Contracting Officer may request that the CMc provide a proposal for the Construction Phase Work.    

“Design Phase Services” means the design phase construction management services, constructability reviews, cost estimate reconciliation services and other related services as described in the scope of work provided in the RFP.

“Construction Phase Work” means all work and services, including general conditions, necessary for the construction of the project described by the plans, specifications and other provisions incorporated into the RFP, excluding Design Phase Services.  Renovation of the existing building will occur while the building is occupied.  GSA intends for the work to be accomplished in multiple phases, and anticipates construction to begin before design is complete.

The CMc is a member of the project team during the design and construction phases, along with GSA as the public owner; GSA’s Construction Manager as-Agent; GSA’s selected architecture and engineering firm and Architect of Record; GSA’s building commissioning firm; GSA’s security consultant, and other consultants.  The CMc shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of, but not limited to,  mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines as needed to perform the services described herein.

A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement.  The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked.  GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being weighed more heavily than price.  This is a multi-step advisory procurement that consists of two stages.  In Stage I, Pre-Solicitation Notice, Offerors must provide a statement from their federal approved bonding corporate surety (see website at /www.fms.treas.gov/c570/index.html), certifying their bonding capacity for a project GMP of $35,000,000 and are required to be licensed general contractors in accordance with state statutes. Other bonding options are available in accordance with FAR 28.204 and may be provided as an alternate to evidence of corporate bonding capacity.  Submissions shall clearly address the Stage I factors identified in this announcement.  Proposals will be evaluated using an Advisory Multi-step Process as specified in FAR 15.202.  The Contracting Officer shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion.  All Offerors shall be informed that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Contracting Officer in response to their submissions concerning their viability, they may still compete in Stage II. 

Stage I Factors
Licensed general contractors having the minimum bonding capacity are invited to respond to this Stage I Pre-Solicitation Notice by submitting one (1) original and five (5) copies of the required technical information.  The submission should be in an 8-1/2” x 11” bound format and should be organized to correspond with the evaluation factors listed below.  The total pre-solicitation notice submission should not exceed ten (10) one-sided  8-1/2”x 11” pages or five (5) double-sided 8-1/2”x 11” pages (not including Table of Contents or Section Separators), with one-inch margins, and in a font not less than 12-point in size.  Font style is optional.

These factors consider Offeror in successfully completing similar projects.  “Similar” is defined as renovation or modernization of multi-story (4-story minimum) buildings of a minimum of 100,000, gross square feet.  These structures can include courthouses, hospital facilities, casinos, Class A office space, research laboratories, government-owned buildings, or major renovations of such similar projects, with a construction cost of a minimum of $25 million.  The SSEB will be limited to reviewing only projects of similarity for purposes of experience.  Relate all projects in type and scope to this project.

Factor 1: Design Phase Services.  As prime contractor completed at least three (3) project(s), within the past ten (10) years of $25 million or more in construction cost and a minimum of 100,000, gross square feet, in which the Offeror provided Design Phase Services similar to those required under this project.  Please provide the name, location and date completed of referenced projects.

Factor 2: Construction Phase Services.  As a prime contractor completed at least three (3) projects, within the past ten (10) years of $25 million or more in construction cost and a minimum of 100,000 gross square feet, in which the Offeror provided construction phase work similar to those required under this project. Please provide the name and location of referenced projects.

Projects presented under Factors 1 and 2 above may be the same projects.
The Stage I Pre-Solicitation Notice factors are independent of the factors in the Stage II Request for Proposal and will be used to evaluate an Offeror’s viability based on its submission to the Stage I Pre-Solicitation Notice.  

Stage II Request for Proposals (RFP) - Proposals will be evaluated and scored according to technical evaluation factors included in the RFP.   The technical proposals will be reviewed and evaluated prior to and separately from the review of price proposals.  As part of the Stage II evaluation, the Contracting Officer and Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) may conduct interviews.  However, the Government reserves the right to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions or oral presentations (clarifications may be made as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.  Final selection will be made based on technical factors being weighted significantly more than price (price being represented by the Offeror’s proposal for Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Services).  The Offerors may use projects submitted in Stage I to respond to the Stage II evaluation factors.  If interviews are conducted, firms will be interviewed at GSA’s Region 4 offices in Atlanta, Georgia, by members of the SSEB.  The following criteria represent the factors that will be used by GSA’s Source Selection Evaluation Board in evaluating Stage II proposals.  Factor 1 considers past performance in providing Design Phase Services on similar projects.  Factor 2 considers past performance in providing Construction Phase Services as a prime contractor on similar projects.  Factor 3 considers qualifications and experience of key personnel.  Factor 4 considers the management plan and technical approach.  Factor 5 considers the offeror’s proposed approach for successful and meaningful participation and performance during Design Phase Services.   Factor 6 considers the offeror’s available resources and facilities to accomplish the project. Stage II also requires offerors that are a large business to indicate their intention to submit a subcontracting plan for the project that provides for participation by small business concerns.

Interested firms must submit their Stage I submission, no later than 2:00 PM EST on Monday, May 11, 2009, to Lawrence Hales, Contracting Officer, General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Acquisition Management Division (4PG), Suite 2500, 401 West Peachtree Street N.W., Atlanta, Georgia, 30308.  A Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit is scheduled to be held on May 21, 2009 at 10:30 am.  All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number (GS-04P-09-EX-C-0078) on the face of the envelope. Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).   Facsimile proposals will not be accepted. Be advised that, due to heightened security measures, individuals entering a Federal facility must have photo identification and may be delayed.  Firms planning to hand-deliver submissions should take this into consideration.

<SUBJECT>84--IMPROVED MODULAR TACTICAL VEST AND PLATE CARRIER
<SOLNBR>M6785409R3000
<CONTACT>Leigh D'Lugos 703-432-3318
<DESC>This Presolicitation Notice is being posted in advance of Solicitation No. M67854-09-R-3000 for an Improved Modular Tactical Vest (IMTV) and Plate Carrier (PC). The Government reserves the right to solicit for one or both systems in the resulting solicitation. The procurement is being issued as a total  Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business set-aside under authority of FAR Part 19.1305. Any offer submitted to the resultant solicitation shall be in compliance with FAR 52.219-3 and 52.219-14. This is a Presolicitation Notice only; NO PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. The Marine Corps Systems Command has a requirement for the production of both a government designed IMTV system and a PC system. The IMTV system carries both soft and hard armor components and has an added capability to incorporate side armor plates. In addition, the IMTV is designed to be an effective load bearing system, using Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipmen! t (MOLLE) webbing loops and built-in pockets, to accommodate a wide variety of commonly used USMC warfighting equipment. The IMTV system provides a number of features that improve upon mission performance, user comfort, and improved load carrying capability when compared to the existing MTV including: 1) modified removable ballistic panel pattern to provide more acceptable body coverage and protection; 2) improved ergonomics, mobility, and fit at the shoulders; 3) improved cummerbund design; 4) improved comfort utilizing a lumbar pad/ support; and, 5) increased MOLLE footprint for load carriage. The PC system consists of a body armor solution that allows commanders to maintain the same direct fire protection as currently fielded USMC tactical vests by allowing for the tradeoff of some indirect fire protection area of coverage in order to reduce weight and thermal load, and increase Marine mobility and lethality. The PC will be comprised of a vest with sewn in soft armor pan! els that provides indirect fire protection a minimum of one-half inch beyond the area of coverage provided by the Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert (ESAPI) plate. It differs from currently fielded USMC tactical vests in that the area of coverage is reduced to the minimum acceptable area for use with the ESAPI plate. The total weight and associated thermal burden are minimized thereby enhancing the individual Marine's mobility and lethality. Government technical data packages for the IMTV and PC are not currently available but will be released with the solicitation. A copy of Purchase Description Body Armor, Multiple Threat/Interceptor, CO/PD 00-02G is being provided as an attachment to this sources sought in order to familiarize respondents with the format and general information that will be provided in the final technical data package. The primary differences between the information provide in CO/PD 00-02G and the final technical data packages will be related to patterns and the use of coyote brown 498 in place of Universal Camouflage. S! ignificant changes in materials or methods/techniques used in assembly are not being contemplated at this time. The Government anticipates awarding multiple Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contracts with step-ladder pricing using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures. The anticipated minimum quantities per contract are 200 IMTVs and 200 PCs; maximum quantities are estimated to be 120,000 PCs and 70,000 PCs per contract. Awards will be made to responsible offerors whose proposals are determined to be technically acceptable with the lowest prices and conform to the solicitation requirements. Offerors may submit proposals for both the IMTV and PC or for only one of the systems. If offerors propose on both systems, they must utilize the same soft armor solution for both the IMTV and the PC. The solicitation will require offerors to submit three (3) size Medium Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) for each sy! stem proposed (i.e., (3) Medium IMTVs and/or (3) Medium PCs). Additionally, a total of  thirty-five (35) 15 X 15 inch ballistic shootpacks will be required for ballistic evaluation purposes. Pass/fail evaluation of proposals will consist of ballistic and non-ballistic evaluations of offeror submitted PDMs and shootpacks against the requirements in the Purchase Description, as well as evaluation of written technical capability information against the requirements in the Purchase Descriptions. Offerors ability to produce 5,000 PCs and/or 9,000 IMTVs per month beginning on or about the 1st quarter of FY 10 will also be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. Past performance will be assessed as a matter of responsibility in accordance with FAR 9.104-1. 
It is anticipated that Solicitation No. M67854-09-R-3000 will be issued mid May and will be posted on the internet at the Federal Business Opportunities website located at the following address: http://www.fedbizopps.gov, and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at http://www.neco.navy.mil. The on-line version of the solicitation will include all documents of the solicitation package. No hard copy of this solicitation will be issued. Amendments, if any, will be posted at the same location as the original solicitation. The complete solicitation package, including amendments, should be received and reviewed prior to submitting a response. The proposal shall be submitted in hard copy form only. No electronic submission of proposals will be accepted. Those responding to the solicitation have the responsibility to obtain all amendments and/or other applicable documents. Offerors are instructed to hold all questions until the solicitation has been issued. Offerors sh! all submit ALL questions in writing to susan.dlugos.ctr@usmc.mil. NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. All items, materials, and components thereof submitted shall be in full compliance with the Berry Amendment (10 U.S.C 2533a), as modified in the National Defense Authorization Act for 2006 (Public Law 109-163) signed 6 January 2006. Offerors may be required to provide detailed information certifying compliance. In order to be eligible for award, interested parties must be registered into the Central Contractor Database (CCR), http://www.ccr.gov, and must have status as a qualified HUBZone small business concern (at time of proposal submission as well as at time of contract award) as determined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) in accordance with 13 CFR part 126.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing an advanced neutron radiography system with the ability to spatial resolve features at a micrometer or less for a variety of sample types.

After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for an advanced neutron radiography system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

This contemplated procurement is anticipated to utilize Recovery Act Funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirement.

NIST has a need for an advanced neutron radiography system that would meet the following requirements:

The neutron radiography system should resolve elemental or isotopic features (density or composition) within a sample for a planar view using thermal and cold neutron radiation provided at the NCNR. The resolution in the planar view shall be 1 micrometer or less for 1 or more dimensions.

The detection efficiency for neutrons striking the detector and processed by the entire system should exceed 45% efficiency for a thermal or lower energy spectrum. The system should be complete, including all necessary electronics and software necessary to collect data from the imaging device by neutron counting, then record and display the results in near real time at neutron flux rates in excess of 106 n/s/cm2. The neutron sensitive element should be changeable in the detector to adjust the field of view and resolution parameters.

The device will allow simultaneous neutron image collection over a field of view with the dimensions of several micrometers by a few centimeters in area. In addition, the device should have the ability to systematically move the sample in a way that larger views can be obtained by mosaic assembly in the software.

The system should have the means to hold and unambiguously align the sample with the neutron imaging element(s).  The system should accommodate significant variations in sample types and dimensions, e.g. few biological cells to hydrogen fuel assemblies. Therefore the preferred system will have the ability to cool, evacuate, heat, etc. the sample during the analysis. 

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your company’s size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture such systems are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<CONTACT>Kristiane E Cooper, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-6671, Fax 301-480-3430, Email kh22k@nih.gov
<DESC>SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT FOR RESEARCH COORDINATING CENTER: Studying Community Programs to Reduce Childhood Obesity

Broad Agency Agreement Number:	NIH-NHLBI-HC-10-15

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small business firms as defined by NAICS Code 541720 to perform as a research coordinating center for the research project Studying Community Programs to Reduce Childhood Obesity. The goal is to examine community childhood obesity programs across the nation by using a natural experiment design.  Results will be disseminated to inform research and national and local policy for reducing the prevalence of childhood obesity.  The NHLBI plans to issue a Broad Agency Announcement to establish this evaluation study, with one five-year contract for a Research Coordinating Center anticipated.  

A national sample of communities will be examined to assess a variety of hypothesized factors addressed by community programs to improve diet and physical activity with the aim of reducing the prevalence of childhood obesity.  The study will employ common metrics for evaluation across programs, obtain key measures across communities, and conduct analyses to examine associations between characteristics of community programs and targeted outcomes of those programs, such as community environments, the media, family behavior, children’s diet and physical activity behaviors, and children’s body mass index.  The project will provide a platform for several partners to collaborate on program evaluations.  One award is planned to a Research Coordinating Center, which will work with the National Collaborative on Childhood Obesity Research (NCCOR) to design and implement the research (see http://www.nccor.org/ for information about NCCOR).

Over the past four decades, obesity rates have increased substantially among U.S. youth.   Factors believed to have contributed to the increase are those that alter energy balance, including greater consumption of food and beverages with higher calories, and less physical activity during school along with more sedentary lifestyles out of school.  Overweight and obese children are at higher risk of serious illnesses during childhood and adulthood, including heart disease, stroke, asthma, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and certain types of cancer.  A 2008 AHA statement on Population-Based Prevention of Obesity recommends “population-based strategies that improve social and physical environmental contexts for healthful eating and physical activity.”  Community programs employing these concepts are being implemented across the nation, including programs supported by the NCCOR partners. This research project will conduct cross-program evaluations to identify factors associated with community program success, using common metrics and approaches.  

The Research Coordinating Center shall be responsible for performing the following tasks:

Study Design and Methods
1.	Providing leadership for development of a study protocol, including scientific aims and research questions, a theory-driven conceptual logic model, study design, measurement and quality control methods, and statistical analysis approaches;

2.	Providing scientific leadership in state-of-the-art quasi-experimental study designs of natural experiments to evaluate outcomes associated with community programs related to childhood obesity.  Of relevance are local and state policies, community characteristics, media, family environments, dietary and physical activity behaviors in youth, and child BMI;

3.	Designing and implementing survey research methodology that employs proper sampling of individuals within communities, as well as organizations within communities, including attention to non-response rates, in order to enable proper estimates of variables of interest at the community level;

4.	Planning and overseeing the conduct of interviews, focus groups, and surveys of key community leaders (e.g., Mayor, school superintendent) regarding policies that could have an impact on childhood obesity;

5.	Providing leadership in analyzing and synthesizing both quantitative and qualitative data;

6.	Designing and implementing a statistical analysis plan to examine associations between characteristics and extent of community programs and outcomes relevant to childhood obesity control.  Analyses should take into account data of a hierarchical nature including (but not limited to) individuals, families, neighborhoods, and communities when necessary for addressing the research questions; 

7.	Planning and overseeing collection of data on characteristics at the individual, family, organizational, and community levels, including key demographics (e.g., socio-economic status, ethnicity, education level), behaviors, policies, media, and environmental factors that may affect childhood obesity.  Included are methods for measuring key dietary and physical activity parameters associated with obesity in youth as well as youth BMI;

8.	Identifying reliable, valid, and feasible measurement instruments; judging the validity and reliability of existing instruments such as questionnaires, interviews, and measures of relevant environments and policies; using objective measurement approaches whenever possible;

9.	Developing questionnaires and interview guides as needed including the use of cognitive interviewing to refine data collection instruments;

10.	Developing and refining a study manual of procedures and pilot testing procedures; training and supervising data collectors;

11.	Establishing and maintaining a study database; maintaining quality control and monitoring collection of a large amount of study data;

Study Processes
12.	Developing and refining a theory-driven conceptual logic model used to provide a vision for the project’s activities, data collection, and analyses;

13.	Leading a multi-disciplinary team with professional qualifications of scientific, managerial, and technical personnel in the following areas: evaluation research, physical activity, nutrition, behavioral science, social science, public health, statistics, and relevant technology;
 
14.	Providing collaborative leadership for activities with multiple partners, where all partners’ needs are met.  This includes providing leadership in the following areas: establishing an infrastructure for working together (including a committee and subcommittee structure), approaches to collaborative protocol development (including a process for decision-making), approaches to mutual problem-solving, and coordination of all aspects of the study;

15.	Developing informed consent documents and processes as needed and obtaining approval of protocol and Informed Consent by any necessary IRBs;

16.	Coordinating, arranging, participating, and providing information necessary for regular Steering Committee, training and other study meetings;

17.	Providing reports for regular meetings of a study Data and Safety Monitoring Board; providing statistical support for investigators (including Research Coordinating Center investigators) to publish scientific papers and present at scientific meetings; 

18.	Providing technical reports as required by the Government, which is at least annually, but may be as frequent as quarterly, and at study completion; 

19.	Providing a lay-level summary of study findings used for timely and appropriate feedback to communities implementing childhood obesity programs or planning to do so.

STATEMENT of WORK
Part of TIPS core software since the late 1980s, EarthVision has been used on over 60 projects  ranging from minor complaints of site drainage through high profile major regulatory issues, rewrites, and Environmental Impact Statements to the modeling and remediation design of OSMs largest AML project, the $12,000,000 Dolph Fire.In Summer 2009, a totally new release (version 8) will be distributed.  Version 8s powerful new modeling and visualization and editing features and the new Windows-friendly interface offer more and easier to use tools for SMCRA purposes.  This training is explicitly designed to introduce and train new users to apply Earthvision to SMCRA situations. Vendor will prepare a 3-day course (24 classroom hours) in EarthVision using drilling, chemical analyses and other data provided by OSM.  The course will use these real data to address the fundamentals of EarthVision and its unique user interface and then advance to training users to develop their own real-world models of geochemistry and geology using the OSM-supplied data.  The Vendor will develop the course, prepare complete sets of training materials, travel to AR and WR and train a total of 20 students with the aid of OSM teaching assistants.The first session is to be held in Pittsburgh, PA in June 2009 and the second in Denver in September 2009.  OSM will provide the SMCRA data, training facilities, and teaching assistants.Only one other vendor has access to Version 8 and the requisite background to develop the course and prepare training materials.  That vendor is the British subsidiary of the parent company.  The rate schedule of the subsidiary is more expensive and does not have GSA pricing.  The additional instructor travel costs would significantly exceed monies available within the 2009 budget.

<DESC>Justification Information: TIPS Autodesk AutoCAD Map 3D 2010 Software Purchase of Five Additional Network Licenses and Associated Annual Maintenance Subscription Requisition  DLT Solutions, Inc.Autodesk AutoCAD Map 3D is a TIPS core software package that provides tools for engineering design and review as well as geographic information system (GIS) capabilities.  The software is used by both regulatory and AML scientists specializing in geology, soil science, hydrology, civil or mining engineering, or related natural sciences.  The five (5) additional network licenses and associated annual maintenance subscription are to be rolled into TIPS existing license pool to provide uninterrupted access to users in support of state and tribal abandoned mine land and regulatory programs under SMCRA.Autodesk software has been part of the TIPS core software for many years.  The associated software packages (i.e., Civil 3D, Map 3D, and Raster Design) were selected based on their advanced computer aided design capabilities and wide acceptance by professionals in the mining and mine reclamation industry as well as in state and tribal abandoned mine land and regulatory programs.  The Autodesk software also serves as the base engine for Carlson Mining, another of the core software programs that provides computer automated earthwork design capabilities necessary to easily and efficiently achieve Title IV and Title V efforts under SMCRA.  The Carlson Mining and Autodesk Raster Design packages run as components of Autodesk Civil 3D and Map 3D; they are not standalone packages.
Autodesk has been a leader in computer aided design software for over 25 years.  Autodesk first revolutionized the software industry with the AutoCAD product, which introduced drafting on a PC.  The widespread popularity of AutoCAD software established Autodesks continued commitment to practical innovation that increases productivity and profitability in the drafting and design arena.  AutoCAD paved the way for Autodesk technology leadership in industries such as building, infrastructure, manufacturing, media and entertainment, and wireless data.  Today, Autodesk is a fully diversified software company that provides a wide variety of solutions for creating, managing, and sharing electronic (i.e., digital) data.  The Autodesk community includes more than six million users; in addition, they have four global strategic partnersMicrosoft, Intel, Hewlett-Packard, and IBMas well as 2,500 third-party developers.
For decades, engineering professionals have used AutoCAD software to create and edit precise spatial data for use in a GIS product to produce maps and reports.  In the mid 1990s, Autodesk Map software began removing the boundaries between CAD and GIS. Over the past decade, Autodesk Map 3D has evolved into a comprehensive GIS product that still includes the complete, most current version of AutoCAD.  The precision editing capabilities of AutoCAD are well known.  Autodesk Map 3D adds these capabilities to other GIS data formats and applications. With Autodesk Map 3D, you can compile links to multiple project components into a single composite document, support multiple users querying and editing drawings simultaneously, create and define real-world features and models, connect your GIS layers and CAD drawings to spatial and nonspatial databases, use real-world coordinate systems, and publish data to the Internet.

The NERC/WECC compliance testing on all of the main units at each project will be performed by the contractor with the assistance of the project personnel.  Once the compliance testing is complete the vendor shall provide a compliance report suitable for inclusion in a compliance report for NERC/WECC.  The contractor providing the compliance testing and reports must have a minimum of ten years experience in providing compliance testing main unit exciters and controls.<BR><BR>2.0	SUBMITTALS AND REQUIREMENTS<BR><BR>2.0.1  WECC Compliance Testing<BR>The government will provide the unit data and installed equipment data (Exciter, Governor, etc.) for the main units to be tested at the Ice Harbor and Lower Monumental projects.  Detailed test procedures from the vendor shall be submitted to the technical POC for government review with at least 30 calendar days prior to beginning onsite compliance testing of the units addressed in the submitted procedures.<BR><BR>       2.0.2 WECC Compliance Testing Report<BR>The vendor shall submit a report for each Main Unit tested suitable for inclusion in a compliance report to NERC/WECC.  Reports shall be submitted within 30 calendar days after completion of testing of each unit and not later than 9/30/09.<BR><BR>3.0	SCOPE<BR>The successful bidder shall perform WECC compliance testing, and provide a report suitable for inclusion in a compliance report to NERC/WECC.  Testing shall include performance of the NERC\WECC Compliance testing on 6 main units at Ice Harbor Dam and 6 main units at Lower Monumental Dam. <BR><BR>4.0  Additional Information/Schedule<BR>Scheduling of the compliance testing shall be coordinated with the projects through the Ice Harbor POC.  All unit compliance testing at each project shall be completed with allowance of one day for each unit.  Testing of multiple units on the same day shall be coordinated with the project POC and the applicable operating agencies.  The testing for the units can be done in concurrence if the contractor has the personnel to support the testing at each project within the same week and dependant on approval by applicable operating agencies as coordinated through the POC.  A detailed schedule of the testing at each project will have to be submitted to the POC at least 30 days prior to the commencement of the onsite work, to allow scheduling of these items.  The current plan for all of the testing is scheduled for the month of September and the contractor will work with project personnel on the compliance testing methods for each unit.   The submitted test reports shall be submitted to the project POC not later than 9/30/09 to accomplish final payment for this contract work.<BR><BR>The capability curves are provided for each of the Ice Harbor and Lower Monumental families of units on the attached Adobe files.  <BR><BR>5.0 GENERAL<BR><BR>5.1 WECC COMPLIANCE TESTING<BR>As part of this contract WECC Compliance testing of the Lower Monumental and Ice Harbor Main Units shall be performed by the Contractor with the assistance of project personnel.  As part of this testing specific project personnel will work with the contractor on the testing to learn how it is done for future testing on these units.  There are a total of six units at each project that need to be tested as part of this contract.  The data and the equipment for each main unit will be provided as part of the contract to accommodate the final contractor test report and initial test plans.<BR><BR>5.1.1	Ice Harbor Main Unit Compliance Testing<BR>The original test reports for these units for the WECC/NERC submittal were last performed in 1999.  All six units have Basler DECS-300-N digital exciters that were installed when the original test reports were submitted. <BR>5.1.2	Lower Monumental Main Unit Compliance Testing<BR>Main Units 1, 2, and 3:<BR>As part of this compliance testing it should be identified that the Lower Monumental Units 1 through 3 are limited on capability curve testing due to generator terminal voltage and operating conditions.  This is due to the effects of terminal voltage in relation to the MVAR output and grid conditions.  In the testing of these units the terminal voltage will shift the capability curve and limiters on the Cutler Hammer ECS 2100 Exciters.  During the testing this will be seen and a new curve will have to be plotted manually due to the limiters for the exciters coming in prior to reaching the capability curve which is shown at rated generator terminal voltage.  The terminal voltage is not able to get up to the rated generator terminal voltage capability curve installed for these units due to grid conditions and the placement of the Lower Monumental units within the power system.

<DESC>The Samuel S. Stratton VA Medical Center, Located at 113 Holland Ave., Albany NY 12208, is seeking to enter into a lease agreement for between 9,000 and 9,999 square feet within one quarter mile of the campus, as bounded by New Scotland on the West, Morris Street or Dana Ave. to the North, Delaware Ave. on the East, and Holland Ave. on the South..This lease can be for a building in place or a building to be erected for this purpose.  The VA wishes to receive initial price and building proposals within thirty days of this notice (May 26, 2009) and take occupancy of the space by   November 15, 2009.The building in question would contain the following VA departments and their approximate square footage requirements (common areas are not computed below but are estimated to account for the remainder of the square footage): 1.	Audiology - 2300 sq. ft.2.	Comp & Pen - 1700 sq. ft.3.	Fiscal - 1500 sq. ft.4.	HIMS - 900 sq. ft.All of these departments outside of Audiology and Comp and Pen are administrative in nature and will not have special requirements outside of standard class B or better office space.  Audiology will require soundproof exam and fitting rooms.  Audiology space must also be able to accommodate several VA-provided audio testing booths which must be recessed into the floor or have ADA-compliant ramps to enter into them.  All exam rooms in the audiology area must contain hand sinks.  Further, this space must include a fabrication/repair/modification room that will require a dedicated exhaust with make up air over the work space.Comp and Pen will have two exam rooms and a triage room which will all require sinks and are essentially light clinical space.A more comprehensive breakdown of the requirements for each department's space (including specific number of rooms and expected square footage) is available to interested offerors by contacting Jason White at 518-626-6844 or Jason.White@VA.gov.  Due to formatting concerns this list cannot be included in this posting.This space will need to be furnished by the eventual lessor.  The VA will not be providing or buying any furniture for this space aside from Medical Audiology equipment, which will be procured and maintained by the VA during the lease term.  In addition to the floorplan detail mentioned above, a comprehensive furniture list can be provided to interested offerors by contacting Mr. White using the information above.Additionally, the eventual lessor will need to furnish 40-50 paved, lined parking spaces directly adjacent to this building.  The VA will consider space that spans more than one floor, but all space must be directly contiguous and shall not have spans or jogs that are uninhabited or inhabited by other tenants.Due to the proximity of the VA to the eventual lease site, the VA will provide its own grounds maintenance and snow removal for this site as appropriate.  The VA reserves the right to negotiate the inclusion of other services (janitorial, utilities, taxes, etc) with the eventual lessor before award is made.If interested, please contact Jason V. White, Contract Specialist at 518-626-6844 or Jason.White@VA.gov.

The purpose of this purchase order is to support the completion and evaluation of projects initiated under the partnership with PIH and the Division of Tuberculosis Elimination (DBTE). The activities will focus on comparing the frequency of acquired resistance to second line anti-TB drugs among MDR TB patients in GLC versus non-GLC sites who are being treated with 2nd-line anti-TB drugs; to determine the risk factors for acquired resistance in these same groups; and to determine and compare MDR TB treatment success rates in these same groups. At present, all project records and data&nbsp;are maintained by the PIH and its subsidiary. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide the services described above should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to provide the services. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive requirement.

The tentative schedule of events follows: 

0730 – 0800 Registration at the NAVAIR WLO in Arlington, VA

The Government reviewed all questions, comments and suggestions from industry in response to the draft eCASS RFP and incorporated updates as required into the final eCASS RFP which was released on 1 April 2009.  All adopted changes were incorporated and clarification was provided where warranted in the final eCASS RFP.

<DESC>The Secretary of the Navy's 60th Current Strategy Forum will be held in Newport RI 15-17JUNE2009. The Forum is designed to offer an opportunity for the nation's public servants, scholars, and senior military officers to join with Naval War College faculty and students to discuss the future strategy of the United States. It provides an opportunity for an exchange of views among outstanding scholars and leaders from across industry, government and the military. While normally held on the Naval War College(NWC) campus, renovations make that impossible for the June 15-17 timeframe. The requirements for this venue make it unique in that the expected number attending will be between 1000-1100.Due to the anticipated large attendance and desire to keep the event in reasonable close proximity to the NWC campus, and the sheer lack of availability of other venues, the NWC intends to award a sole source contract to the Hyatt Regency Newport under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The ! point of contact for this acquisition is Sheila K. Valloney(401)841-3727.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.

1.0 SCOPE  This specification defines the requirements for the design, performance, delivery, installation, and testing of the Tactical Radar Threat Generator (TRTG) portable EW trailers.
1.1 BackgroundYuma Tactical Training Range uses mobile TRTG to train air crews in air defiance evasion and suppression. The systems currently in use are mounted on a truck with a generator set towed on a portable EW trailer.  By mounting these systems on trucks the usefulness of the truck is lost to the single use and with the acquisition of three additional units to supplement the existing two systems there are not enough chassis that could be used in this singular application. To improve use of limited prime moving resources, and improve overall system reliability (if the truck is broke the system can not be deployed), five portable EW trailers need to be built to the below specifications.  Two will be used for the exiting systems to be transferred and three for the new systems. 
The portable EW trailers shall mount the TRTG hut, generator set and fuel tanks for the generators, and an inverter converting the single phase AC power from the generator to three phase AC power.

The anti-aircraft radars are to be mounted to the portable EW trailers with all required equipment mounted to the portable EW trailers to perform their mission. 
The five portable EW trailers are being acquired for the purpose of mounting the radar threat simulators.

The Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible for the strategic planning, program design and implementation, achievement of results, and reporting for the USAID assistance programs for the five Central Asian republics.  The U.S. Government’s program of assistance in the region is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources, including energy; and improved primary healthcare.  It ranks as one of the Agency’s largest programs, with funding levels that have averaged over $139 million annually.  The Mission implements its programs together with more than 80 contractor and grantee teams.  The staff manages a program that addresses six Strategic Objectives (SO) principally focused on assisting these former communist states in making the transition to Western-style democracies with viable market economies.

The Mission currently has three technical offices: Office of Economic Growth (OEG), Democracy and Conflict Mitigation (DM), and Health and Education (HE) and is in the process of designing the 2007-2011 Strategy.  Under the 2000-2006 Strategy, the Office of Economic Growth (OEG) is responsible for the management of a large portfolio which comprises of two Strategic Objectives, SO1.3 – An Improved Environment for the Growth of Small and Medium Enterprises with three intermediate results (IRs)

•	Increased Access to business information, knowledge, and skills (IR 1.3.1)
•	More responsive financial institutions, instruments, and markets (IR 1.3.2)
•	Increased implementation of laws and regulations (IR 1.3.3)

And SO 1.6 Improved Management of Critical Natural Resources, Including Energy, with IRs: 

•	Increased management capacity in the natural resources sector (IR 1.6.1)
•	Improved Policy and Regulatory Framework for Natural Resources Management (IR 1.6.2)
•	Sustainable Models Developed for Integrated Natural Resources Management (IR 1.6.3)
•	Public Commitment Established for Natural Resources Management Policies (IR 1.6.4)

<DESC>RECOVERY:  PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR THE MODERNIZATION OF THE ROBERT SMITH VANCE FEDERAL BUILDING AND COURTHOUSE IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, SOLICITATION NO. GS-04P-09-EX-C-0077.  The Real Estate, Design and Construction Organization in the Southeast Sunbelt Region of Public Buildings Services of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is presently soliciting proposals from qualified Offerors desiring to compete in the procurement process for the subject construction project.  This project is funded from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).  The type of contract is the Construction Manager as-constructor Guaranteed Maximum Price with Construction Contingency Allowance (herein referred to as CMc).  A CMc provides Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work.  GSA intends to contract for Design Phase Services with an option for Construction Phase Work for a major renovation of the Robert Smith Vance Federal Building and Courthouse in Birmingham, Alabama, with the CMc that offers the best overall value to GSA.  Design Phase Services is expected to commence upon award of the contract on or about March 2009.  The Optional Construction Phase Work is anticipated to be awarded on or about March 2010, with a performance period of approximately 900 calendar days.

The existing structure was built in 1921, and is listed on the National Register for Historical Places.  It is a four-story building of approximately 173,993-square-feet.  The two primary tenants of the building are the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama and the federal probation department.  The mission of this scope of work is to support client agencies by housing federal tenants in adjoining spaces to support and maximize efficiencies; and to ensure the viability of the historic structure by identifying major deficiencies.  The guaranteed maximum price for this scope of work is $32,000,000, for combined Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 236220.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures.  

Design has not started on this project.  It is anticipated that this CMc contract and the contract for architectural and engineering will be awarded in the same timeframe.  There are two components of work to be performed under this Contract:  Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work.  The Construction Phase Work is an option.  The CMc is required to complete the Design Phase Services for the firm-fixed-price presented during the procurement process.  At any time during or after Design Phase Services, the Contracting Officer may request that the CMc provide a proposal for the Construction Phase Work.    

“Design Phase Services” means the design phase construction management services, constructability reviews, cost estimate reconciliation services and other related services as described in the scope of work provided in the RFP.

“Construction Phase Work” means all work and services, including general conditions, necessary for the construction of the project described by the plans, specifications and other provisions incorporated into the RFP, excluding Design Phase Services.  Renovation of the existing building will occur while the building is occupied.  GSA intends for the work to be accomplished in multiple phases, and anticipates construction to begin before design is complete.

The CMc is a member of the project team during the design and construction phases, along with GSA as the public owner; GSA’s Construction Manager as-agent; GSA’s selected architecture and engineering firm and Architect of Record; GSA’s building commissioning firm; GSA’s security consultant, and other consultants.  The CMc shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of, and not limited to, architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines as needed to perform the services described herein.

A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement.  The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked.  GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being weighed more heavily than price.  This is a multi-step advisory procurement that consists of two stages.  In Stage I, Pre-Solicitation Notice, interested Offerors must provide a statement from their federally approved bonding corporate surety (see website at http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570/index.html), certifying their bonding capacity for a project with a Guaranteed Maximum Price of $32,000,000.  Other bonding options are available in accordance with FAR 28.204 and may be provided as an alternate to evidence of corporate bonding capacity.  Offerors are required to be licensed general contractors in accordance with State of Alabama statutes.  Offerors responding to Stage I must also submit information in providing Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work.  Submissions shall clearly address the Stage I rating factors identified in this announcement.  Proposals will be evaluated using an Advisory Multi-step Process as specified in FAR 15.202.  The Contracting Officer shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion.  All Offerors shall be informed that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Contracting Officer in response to their submissions concerning their viability, they may still compete in Stage II. 

Licensed general contractors having the minimum bonding capacity are invited to respond to this Stage I Pre-Solicitation Notice by submitting one (1) original and four (4) copies of the required technical information.  The submission should be in an 8-1/2” x 11” bound format and should be organized to correspond with the evaluation factors listed below.  Standard Form 330 may be utilized, but is not required.  The total pre-solicitation notice submission should not exceed 10 one-sided  8-1/2”x 11” pages or 5 double-sided 8-1/2”x 11” pages (not including Table of Contents or Section Separators), with one-inch margins, and in a font not less than 12-point in size.  Font style is optional.  

Description:  These factors consider the Offeror successfully completing similar projects.  “Similar” is defined as renovation or modernization of multi-story (3-story minimum) buildings of a minimum of 100,000, gross square feet.  These structures can include courthouses, hospital facilities, casinos, Class A office space, research laboratories, government-owned buildings, or major renovations of such similar projects, with a construction cost of a minimum of $25 million.  The SSEB will be limited to reviewing only projects of similarity.  Relate all projects submitted in Factors 1 and 2 in type and scope to this project.

Factor 1: Design Phase Services on similar projects.  a) Demonstrate at least one (1) project completed within the past ten (10) years in excess of $25 million in construction cost and a minimum of 100,000, gross square feet, in which the Offeror provided Design Phase Services similar to those required under this project.  

Factor 2: Construction Phase Work as a prime contractor on similar projects.  a) Demonstrate experience on at least three (3) projects completed within the past ten (10) years in excess of $25 million in construction cost and a minimum of 100,000, gross square feet, in which the Offeror provided Construction Phase Work similar to those required under this project.  

Projects proposed under Factor 1 and Factor 2 may be the same.  The Stage I Pre-Solicitation Notice factors are independent of the factors in the Stage II Request for Proposal and will be used to evaluate an Offeror’s viability based on its submissions to the Stage I Pre-Solicitation Notice.  Offerors will be notified of viability and the Request for Proposal will be released on or about May 15, 2009.  

Stage II Request for Proposals (RFP).  Proposals will be evaluated and scored according to technical evaluation factors included in the RFP.   The technical proposals will be reviewed and evaluated prior to and separately from the review of price proposals.  As part of the Stage II evaluation, the Contracting Officer and Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) may conduct interviews.  However, GSA reserves the right to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions or oral presentations (clarifications may be made as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.  Final selection will be made based on technical factors being weighted significantly more than price (price being represented by the Offeror’s proposal for Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Work).  The Offerors may use projects submitted in Stage I to respond to the Stage II evaluation factors.  If interviews are conducted, firms will be interviewed at GSA’s Region 4 offices in Atlanta, Georgia, by members of the SSEB.  The following criteria represent the factors that will be used by GSA’s Source Selection Evaluation Board in evaluating Stage II proposals.  Factor 1 considers past performance in providing Design Phase Services on similar projects.  Factor 2 considers past performance in providing Construction Phase Services as a prime contractor on similar projects.  Factor 3 considers qualifications and experience of key personnel.  Factor 4 considers the management plan and technical approach.  Factor 5 considers the Offeror’s proposed approach for successful and meaningful participation and performance during Design Phase Services.   Factor 6 considers the Offeror’s available resources and facilities to accomplish the project. Stage II also requires Offerors that are large businesses to indicate their intention to submit a subcontracting plan for this project that provides for participation by small business concerns.  Stage II proposals will be due on or about June 15, 2009.

Interested firms must send their Stage I submission, no later than 2:00 PM EST on Monday, May 11, 2009, to Valerie Riecke Smith, PhD, DBIA, Contracting Officer, General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Acquisition Management Division (4PG), Suite 2500, 401 West Peachtree Street N.W., Atlanta, Georgia, 30308.  A Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit is anticipated on or about May 28, 2009, in Birmingham, Alabama, and will be established and published in the Request for Proposals in Stage II.  All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number (GS-04P-09-EX-C-0077) on the face of the envelope.  Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).   Facsimile proposals will not be accepted.  Be advised that, due to heightened security measures, individuals entering a Federal facility must have photo identification and may be delayed.  Firms planning to hand-deliver submissions should take this into consideration.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<BR><BR>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation System (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a sole source RFP under solicitation number W58RGZ-09-Q-0218.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26 effective 12 June 2008 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Document Change Notice (DCN) current to 20080513. This procurement is being conducted pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 for other than full and open competition to Tel-Instrument Electronics Corp., 728 Garden Street, Carlstadt, NJ  07072. The associated North American Industrial Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334511 with an associated small business size standard of 500. New equipment ONLY, NO remanufactured products, and no grey market. Offerors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Only qualified offerors may submit quotes. This acquisition is firm-fixed-price.<BR>This requirement is to procure Four (4) TR 420 Transponder Test Sets. The TR 420 to be procured under this contract is a non-developmental item, designed, manufactured and qualification tested in accordance with applicable military specifications. REQUIREMENT DESCRIPTION: 1.0 PURPOSE: The TR 420 (Multi-function including Mode 5) Ramp Test Set is the next generation of avionics support equipment.  It is a battery powered portable unit used to test the operation of Transponders and Interrogators including Mode S Transponders, EHS, ADS-B and IFF (Identification Friend or Foe).   The authority permitting other than full and open competition is U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 entitled Only One or a Limited Number of Responsible Sources and No Other Type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed acquisition requires the use of the authority cited based on the following:  a.) The TR 420 is manufactured and available only from the proposed contractor, Tel-Instrument Electronics Corp, Cage Code 92606.  They are the only source capable of providing the capabilities, as Tel-Instrument is the manufacturer of the TR 420.

To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option.  In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer.

At contract completion the contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed.  A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness.  The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all government property took over the course of the contract.

If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below:
		Commandant (CG-9131)
		U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.

INTRODUCTION

The Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find, in a timely manner, adequate staff to cover all positions in the field and in Washington, and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  The SRG program brings on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and who can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA’s response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations.  SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.

The SRG program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in OFDA/OPS.  This team maintains a database for all contracted Support Relief Group staff and provides information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified SRG for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing SRG.  Each SRG incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVE

OFDA requires SRG personnel to meet its surge capacity objectives, and to strengthen its capability to support OFDA’s mandate and the delivery of humanitarian assistance around the world.  OFDA will extend consideration to generalists and to applicants with specific educational and professional experience, including in one of the following humanitarian sectors:  Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH); Food Security, Agriculture, and Livestock; and Shelter and Settlements.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

All SRG personnel will be responsible for performing all or some of the tasks below. However, all work will be done in coordination with OFDA personnel.  SRG personnel are considered U.S. Government (USG) employees, and, as such, are required to further USG foreign policy objectives.

SRG personnel respond to humanitarian emergencies - natural, technological and conflict-related disasters - as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on Response Management Teams (RMTs), which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) from Washington.  The contractor may also be required to travel on short notice as a critical component of a USG disaster assessment team or a DART or to backfill staff members in OFDA regional or program offices overseas.  

•	Conduct initial assessments of the vulnerable populations and recommend appropriate relief activities.  Facilitate and coordinate USG emergency response activities with the USAID Mission, with other donor agencies, and with the U.S. Embassy. Provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of events;
•	Coordinate and liaise with other responders, i.e., government agencies, international organizations or private voluntary organizations.  Brief host governments, U.S. Embassy, USAID Mission, and the U.S. Military as necessary;
•	Coordinate and manage oversight of OFDA-funded activities to ensure the proper use of OFDA program funds.  Monitor financial statements from the grantee(s) and the timeliness and quality of response(s);
•	Identify disaster mitigation measures where appropriate that could be linked to disaster response activities.  Review mitigation principles and recommend course(s) of action to OFDA/Washington staff;
•	Develop various types of country/regional strategies for field offices, DARTs and assessment teams.  Provide briefings and written reports as required;
•	Conduct personnel-related activities, property management, safety and security assessments, supply management, contracting services, leasing, travel, and records management, as needed and when tasked;

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<p><br />Solicitation provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD USING LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) PROCEDURES</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>a. Basis for Contract Award:<br />This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, as supplemented. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated cost or price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b. Number of Contracts to be Awarded:<br />The Government intends to select one contractor for the Louden Requirements. However, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>c. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:<br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>d. Correction Potential of Proposals:<br />The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any proposal uncertainty. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>a. List factors and Subfactors:<br />The Government will evaluate for acceptability the factors described below:</p>
<p>Factor 1- Technical Proposal <br />Factor 2- Cost/Price <br />Factor 3-Past Performance</p>
<p>b. Evaluation Methodology:<br />Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all offers. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the proposals will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price.</p>
<p>Then, the offerors' past performance will be evaluated starting with the lowest price technically acceptable offer. Only those offerors determined to have an acceptable past performance rating, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Past performance evaluations will cease when the first two technically acceptable proposals receive an acceptable past performance rating for price comparison purposes.</p>
<p>Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced proposal meeting the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.</p>
<p>c. Technical Factor:<br />By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation technical requirements, to include the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, and will be determined technically acceptable. If the offeror is unable to meet the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, the offeror may set forth the delivery schedule the offeror is prepared to meet. However, should the offeror's proposed delivery schedule not meet the Required Delievery Schedule and should the Government determine such proposed delivery schedule to be unacceptable, the offeror will be determined UNACCEPTABLE. If the offeror's proposed delivery is determined acceptable, the solicitation will be amended and each offeror will be afforded an opportunity to revise their proposals. If the offeror does not propose a different delivery schedule, the Government's Required Delivery Schedule shall apply. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Each proposal will receive one of the ratings described below for Factor 1 - Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Acceptable - The proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - The proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for contract performance. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.</p>
<p>d. Cost/Price Factor:</p>
<p>Cost/Price Evaluation: The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated for award purposes by adding the total price for basic requirements (basic award).</p>
<p>Total Evaluated Price: Price analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. The total evaluated price will be calculated as the sum of the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) unit/extended prices plus other associated factors such as transportation costs if appropriate.</p>
<p>Unrealistically Low Costs or Prices: Unrealistically low proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>Unbalanced Pricing: Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalance pricing. Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. The Government shall analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to separately priced line items or subline items. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>e. Past Performance Factor:<br />Past performance information may be gathered from both Government (such as RYG, MOCAS, CPARS) and commercial sources. Offerors will not be penalized if no past performance information is available. Past performance will either be satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory where satisfactory equals a neutral or determination of responsibility, and unsatisfactory equals a determination of non-responsibility. Any unsatisfactory rating given to a small business will be referred to the Small Business Administration pursuant to FAR 15.101-2(b) and 19.6 for resolution.</p>
<p>f. Discussions:<br />It is the Government's intent to award without discussions, therefore, it is imperative that offerors submit their best terms initially. However, if during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs), and the Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) will be considered in making the source selection decision.<br /><br />PRE-AWARD SURVEY<br /><br />The Government may conduct a pre-award survey (PAS) as part of this source selection. Results of the PAS (if conducted) will be evaluated to determine each offerors' capability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>PLANT VISITS<br /><br />In the event discussions are necessary, plant visits may be conducted during the evaluation phase to develop knowledge for judging the potential for correction of deficiencies. <br /><br />SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or sub-factors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. section 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. section 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC>CONTRACTING OFFICE
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Food and Drug Administration Agency (FDA) / Office of Acquisitions and Grants (OAGs)

DESCRIPTION 
This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide Technical Support for Operation and Maintenance of Advanced Signal Detection Software for the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERs) for a 12 month Base Period + 2 Option Periods.  

The Contractor's capability statement shall demonstrate the company's ability to meet the following requirements.  Please provide a detailed description of your company’s (including its teammates, if applicable) experience and demonstrated abilities to deliver each and every one (address each separately) of the following general and specific requirements

GENERAL REQUIREMENT
The FDA requires the services of a Contractor to create an environment where CFSAN statisticians can mine CAERS data independent of the current production system, identify and perform CAERS data cleaning needs with respect to product and ingredient names, and update the current production CAERS database.  Specifically the Office of Food Defense, Communication and Emergency Response (OFDCER) requires services for the operation and maintenance of software designed to detect safety signals of potential food and cosmetic safety problems. CFSAN requires a system that allows product code corrections; that can merge with the current production CAERS database with no negative impact to the CAERS data; and that can be merged with a larger Agency wide adverse event reporting database even as FDA updates its current adverse event system.  Safety signals are individual food or cosmetic adverse event combinations that occur in a higher than expected proportion. These signals need to be carefully investigated to understand if regulatory action needs to be taken.  

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
a) Develop a signal annotation feature that allows users to differentiate signals that are disease related 
b) Develop a signal annotation feature that allows users to recognize duplicates reports, and/or reports that are linked in some other way e.g. related individuals
c) Develop alternative data mining techniques to determine approaches most productive for use in generation of safety signals in CAERS data and provide application of statistical tools such as time series analysis and logistic regression.
d) Identify and perform CAERS data cleaning needs with respect to product and ingredient names and possible product hierarchies.
e) Establish product hierarchies depending on proposed solutions, and to develop a flexible feature for count data.
A firm fixed price type of contract is anticipated.  The previous source for this requirement was Lincoln Technology. The NAICS Code is 541511, with a small business size standard of $25M.

Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.  However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents’ capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required.  Responses must directly demonstrate the company’s capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform each of the tasks described above at a sufficient level of detail to allow definitive numerical evaluation; and evidence that the contractor can satisfy the minimum requirements listed above while in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 (“Limitations on Subcontracting”).

<DESC><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY Department of the Air Force 311th Human Systems Wing/Directorate of Contacting Organizational Support Branch 8150 Aeromedical Road Brooks City-Base, TX 78235-5123 Program Name: Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition for the Environmental Data Acquisition, Position, Telemetry System (EDAPTS) for the USAF Radiation Dosimetry Laboratory PR Number: FM285582590030-70 II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED This is a follow-on requirement that will augment and upgrade the current Environmental Data Acquisition, Position, and Telemetry System (EDAPTS) capability as well as procuring two (2) training packages. A team of US Air Force (USAF) scientists developed the original EDAPTS by integrating commercial off-the-shelf items using readily available technology to create a new system. The EDAPTS was engineered/manufactured by Thermo Fisher Scientific under Veterans Administration (VA) Contract 673-TP5056 with a firm fixed pricing arrangement. The original design of the system was developed by Thermo-Electron; however, that company merged with Fisher Scientific forming Thermo Fisher Scientific. This requirement will be executed through Thermo Scientific, a branch of the parent Thermo Fisher Scientific, under a firm fixed priced contract. III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY&rsquo;S NEEDS Under the contemplated contract, Thermo Scientific will provide the following supplies in the upgrade of the EDAPTS at a cost of approximately $842K. Deliveries of these items will be one year from award and Medical Logistics (97X4930) stock funds will fund this effort. ITEM No. Quantity Product Part No__ Total Price______ 1.

STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR&rsquo;S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISTION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) The EDAPTS is a unique system that monitors response personnel via various electronic components for physiological stressors (heart rate, temperature, respirations, etc), radiological exposure (to ionizing radiation), and the individual&rsquo;s Global Positioning System coordinates and then transmits via telemetry to a central location for display and data storage. To that end, the USAF team has developed over the last six years the capability to monitor 1,000 response personnel remotely for the various factors described above (EDAPTS). It is essential that all hardware and software components be compatible to ensure interoperability and mission success, therefore, the use of Thermo Scientific components are essential to the Government requirements. Emerging technologies will not be compatible with the current system, thereby, precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. Products manufactured by another company will require additional modifications to the existing system at an increased cost of $500K plus the expense of the other company&rsquo;s products. The first contract was awarded by the VA Supply Service, which awarded contract # 673-TP5056 to Thermo Electron for the original system. The initial contract was an unrestricted competitive procurement and awarded on October 7, 2004 with final delivery of the system in January 2005. A modification to the system to perform an upgrade was processed by the VA Supply Service under order 673-TP53. This upgrade to the EDAPTS provided a wireless mote (type of transmitter) technology. This order was awarded April 26, 2005. Final delivery of the upgrade was in July 2005. Therefore, this acquisition will be a follow-on contract for the continued development of this highly specialized system. Presently, the USAF owns the only EDAPT system in the world; all data generated by this system is the sole property and responsibility of the USAF. Substantial data from testing scenarios has yielded several areas where the system can be improved. As the manufacturer of the USAF designed system, Thermo Fisher Scientific, through its subsidiaries, possesses the EDAPTS engineering expertise and historical test performance data, as well as all the legacy design and engineering data/information available. No other contractor possesses this capability. This procurement will update the operations of the current system and provide two training sessions to ensure all team members are fully trained and qualified. Thermo Scientific is the sole manufacturer of this system/technology. The system was designed to archive and protect as well as report from Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Privacy Act protected information. Current ongoing development efforts include improvements that contain Thermo Scientific proprietary hardware and software data.</p>

<DESC>Intent for a sole source award for a "Red List of Antiquities at Risk". 

The U.S. Department of State intends to award a noncompetitive contract to International Council of Museums (ICOM) for Producing, Printing and Promoting, a “Red List of Columbia Antiquities at Risk”. International Council of Museums is the only organization that produces the Official Red List.

This purchase will be made as an Other than Full and Open Competition as authorized by 41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". The anticipated award date is 26 May 09. This notice is neither a request for competitive proposals nor a solicitation of offers. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

The justification for this sole source procurement is for the production and distribution of a Red List of Colombia Antiquities at Risk.   Red Lists are representative lists of general types or categories of objects, generally protected by national legislation and international agreements, which are subjected to illicit international trafficking.  The Red Lists are intended to protect cultural heritage at risk by helping customs officials, police officers, art dealers, museums, and collectors to recognize possible illicit objects and take appropriate action when they are identified.  

The publication of this Red List will fulfill the Cultural Antiquities Task Force congressional mandate [Senate Report 109-277, FY07 Appropriations Legislation] to assist international organizations to preserve and track historically and culturally significant works stolen from other countries.  

The Government has researched this requirement and found that International Council of Museums is the only organization providing this service in the U.S.
