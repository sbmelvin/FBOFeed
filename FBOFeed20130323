<SUBJECT>34--Surface Ship Hull Cutting Machine - Cold-Cutting Type
<SOLNBR>SPMYM213R0009
<CONTACT>Jay Lewis 360-467-0166
<DESC>DLA MARITIME - PUGET SOUND intends to issue a solicitation funded by the Navy’s Environmental Sustainability Development to Integration (NESDI) program for the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS & IMF) for the development of a surface ship hull cutting machine prototype. The machine will be used to cut away large sections of steel structure (hull) from decommissioned U.S. Naval ships for the purpose of recycling. Its primary purpose will be to efficiently and effectively perform this task while reducing the visible smoke opacity by eliminating usage of existing oxy-fuel type cutting torches for this type of operation. The machine will be deployed aboard a ship by being mounted or supported by the ship structure itself and easily assembled and disassembled.

The design of this cutting device and all supporting and powering components are open to any Industry and any ‘non-smoke/cold-cutting’ type device, configuration, technology and development provided that the performance requirements contained in the solicitation and listed in the Specifications are adequately achieved.
 

This requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis using full and open competition under the Commercial Items procedures outlined in FAR Part 12. This requirement will consider the most technically acceptable evaluation factors in determining the successful offeror. The applicable NAICS Code is 333517. The forthcoming solicitation number for this requirement will be provided in 15 days from the date of this synopsis in accordance with FAR 5.203(a) and listed under solicitation SPMYM2-13-R-0019. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available for download on or shortly after 7 April 2013. 

The solicitation document will provide instructions for an optional PSNS site visit in Bremerton, WA to tour the facility and understand the current ship dismantling process.
 The purpose of this site visit is to give interested parties and emerging market entrants a better perspective of how the prototype will be deployed and answer questions regarding technical specifications and evaluation requirements. It is anticipated that the date of this site will be approximately 2-3 weeks after the solicitation has posted to NECO..    

The RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) web link at https://www.neco.navy.mil and will also be available for download at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Offerors wishing to submit an offer are responsible for downloading their own copy of the RFP from these websites and to frequently monitor the sites for any amendments to the RFP.
 A bidders list will not be maintained by this office, no telephone or fax requests for the RFP package will be accepted. Failure to respond to the electronically posted RFP and associated amendments prior to the date and time set for receipt of quotes may render vendor offer non-responsive and result in rejection of the same. Firms interested in submitting proposals must: (1) complete the pricing, (2) complete all representation and certifications found in the solicitation, (3) provide technical data, drawings and plans of proposed prototype in strict accordance with the solicitation specifications, and (4) ensure current registration in the SAM system at htpps://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.
 

Any questions must be submitted in writing via e-mail to Jason.lewis@dla.mil.

The design of this cutting device and all supporting and powering components are open to any Industry and any ‘non-smoke/cold-cutting’ type device, configuration, technology and development provided that the performance requirements contained in the solicitation specifications are adequately achieved.
 

This requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis using full and open competition under the Commercial Items procedures outlined in FAR Part 12. This requirement will consider the most technically acceptable evaluation factors in determining the successful offeror. The applicable NAICS Code is 333517. The forthcoming solicitation number for this requirement will be provided in 15 days from the date of this synopsis in accordance with FAR 5.203(a) and listed under solicitation SPMYM2-13-R-0019. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available for download on or shortly after 7 April 2013. 

The solicitation document will provide instructions for an optional PSNS site visit in Bremerton, WA to tour the facility and understand the current ship dismantling process.
 The purpose of this site visit is to give interested parties and emerging market entrants a better perspective of how the prototype will be deployed and answer questions regarding technical specifications and evaluation requirements. It is anticipated that the date of this site will be approximately 2-3 weeks after the solicitation has posted to NECO..    

The RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) web link at https://www.neco.navy.mil and will also be available for download at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Offerors wishing to submit an offer are responsible for downloading their own copy of the RFP from these websites and to frequently monitor the sites for any amendments to the RFP.
 A bidders list will not be maintained by this office, no telephone or fax requests for the RFP package will be accepted. Failure to respond to the electronically posted RFP and associated amendments prior to the date and time set for receipt of quotes may render vendor offer non-responsive and result in rejection of the same. Firms interested in submitting proposals must: (1) complete the pricing, (2) complete all representation and certifications found in the solicitation, (3) provide technical data, drawings and plans of proposed prototype in strict accordance with the solicitation specifications, and (4) ensure current registration in the SAM system at htpps://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.

IV. Design Development & Contract Documents

g.	Preliminary and design development drawings for construction projects are a means of identifying alternative approaches to correcting physical and functional deficiencies.   The development of these drawings is an interactive process between the A/E and VA staff in order to produce a narrative and graphical description of possible program alternatives.  As appropriate, the VA will make available prior to contract negotiations a tentative priority list of functional areas which may be included in the project and a statement task.

h.	Preliminary Meeting:  Prior to beginning any design work, a preliminary meeting will be conducted between the A/E and VA staff.  At this stage, the scope of work will be finalized and agreed to by all VA services involved in this project.  At this point the A/E will have surveyed the existing facility to verify all existing conditions and become familiar with all deficiencies that need to be corrected.  The A/E will write a summary of the meeting and submit it to the Contracting Officer/COR for distribution and approval by the appropriate staff.

i.	A/E in collaboration with VA staff will illustrate in sketch form various possible program alternatives and refine them based on continuing interaction with the VA project team.  The A/E will then complete and present alternative architectural and engineering solutions which are functionally and architecturally viable for consideration.  

j.	The VA considers originality and imaginative design an essential part of the A/E's responsibility.  The total environmental approach is a necessity to all planning.  Site, structures, vehicular and pedestrian circulation, open and screened areas and their relationships to each other should be combined to produce a plan that is functional and aesthetically pleasing.  

k.	Complete conceptual alternatives must be displayed on the preliminary drawings.  The work may include the division of an alternative into distinct parts, each of which has an identified priority.  The preliminary drawings must, therefore, be developed so that irrespective of which parts (in priority order) are selected for further development in the Design Development phase, the solution shall provide a well designed facility with respect to functional operation, construction phasing, minimized disruption of existing hospital operation, and compatibility with structure and utilities between (1) existing facilities; (2) those for imminent construction; and, (3) those with low priority for future construction.

l.	A narrative to accompany the drawings shall identify construction phasing which will be necessary to permit continuous operation of critical hospital operations.  In addition, areas of new construction and renovation shall be shown.  A detailed listing of submission requirements for phasing is included in a later paragraph.

m.	Subsequent to each VA review of the A/E's work, The A/E shall incorporate VA recommendations into the Design Development Drawings.

n.	Review Meetings:  Review meetings will be conducted at the end of each design phase.  Two (2) weeks prior to each scheduled review meeting (set forth in SP-13 of the contract); submit three (3) copies of all narratives, drawings, calculations and cost estimates to be reviewed by VA staff.  The cost estimates will reflect the level of completeness at each review stage.  In addition, the A/E shall take minutes of the review meeting and submit two copies to the Contracting Officer/COR for distribution to VA staff.

V. Asbestos Abatement
A/E shall follow Asbestos Abatement Design Manual located in the Technical Information Library:  http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/dManual/dmASBhosp.pdf 

Asbestos Tasks 1 9

Task 1:
Inspect project areas suspected of containing asbestos.  CIH shall submit a preliminary description of asbestos assessment and abatement problems and solutions. The preliminary report shall include the following:
a.	Summary results of review of building records.
b.	Summary results of interview of station personnel.
c.	Determination of whether any materials used in the building construction are known to contain asbestos.  Some trade name materials are known to contain asbestos and should be identified.
d.	Results of visual inspection of the building to determine location and condition of asbestos materials.
e.	Presentation of sampling strategy that will yield statistically viable conclusion on the extent of asbestos present.

Task 2:
Sample suspect materials and select a qualified laboratory to perform analysis.  Provide the name and location of a qualified laboratory for sample analysis which the CIH intends to utilize.

Task 3:
Review sample analysis and determine the most appropriate approach to take during construction.  At this time the CIH should have collected appropriate samples, selected a qualified laboratory for sample analysis, evaluated sample analysis results to determine adequacy for an assessment report, and ensured that the sample analysis results and number of samples taken are adequate to provide the CIH with confidence that the maximum detection of asbestos has been achieved.
Task 4:
Submit laboratory analysis and recommended actions.  Submit an exposure assessment report on the impacted areas of the project.  Include the following information:

a.	Describe the impacted areas by sketches, room numbers or other means.  Show or describe the location of each sample taken, its composition, and identification number.
b.	Classify each impacted space as "Major Abatement", "Minor Abatement", or "No Abatement" areas.  A "Major Abatement" area requires full protective measures   sealing off, change room, shower room, etc; and removal of all asbestos within the limits of the area.  A "Minor Abatement" area can be decontaminated with one or more applications of the "Glove and Bag" approach.  A "No Abatement" area requires no abatement work.
c.	For each "Major Abatement" area, identify area location within building and provide quantity and cost estimates of all asbestos within the limits of the area.  Quantities are to be in linear feet of pipe and square feet of ceilings and walls.  The cost is to be derived from the quantities multiplied by a unit price.
d.	For each "Minor Abatement" area, provide the description, size, location of each pipe element to be decontaminated, and a cost estimate.
e.	Provide a summary of the square feet of floor space for all major and minor abatement areas, the total linear and square feet of asbestos to be abated, the total cost of abatement and a preliminary schedule of completion.  Include in the cost estimate any cost for decontamination of equipment and fixtures.  Provide a copy of the above summary to the construction cost estimator for inclusion as a bid item in the project estimate.  Work will be done in phases.  Consult with the VA on this so that phasing is reflected in cost.
f.	Provide an assessment on the impact of abatement on building sub systems such as ceilings, lights, walls, carpets, pipes and equipment.  Provide room by room description and estimated quantities of impact items to be replaced (number of lighting fixtures, square feet of ceiling, etc.), and a summary of these quantities.  Provide a cost estimate for all impacted items.
g.	Provide a signed cover statement.  This statement shall be in accordance with the "Sample Cover Statement" provided by the VA as a part of the A/E package.
h.	Evaluate the removal cost versus the deferral of some asbestos removal.  The VA will furnish a CIH with a list of areas asbestos would be abandoned in place.  This CIH will then review and make recommendations, and incorporate a final decision into the design.

Task 5:
Design and specify the appropriate techniques and approaches for the execution of the recommended actions in Task 4, and submit specifications and drawings.  Verify if the State Specification will have to be adhered to.

Prepare drawings and specifications for the asbestos abatement work reflecting the assessment report and paragraph 4(h).  The drawings shall be separately identified from the rest of the drawings, could be 1/16" scale plans (if convenient), and shall provide as a minimum the following information:

<DESC>The objective of this project is to utilize mass cytometry to map immune responses in humans and animals that result from various stimuli (including biothreat agents and candidate medical countermeasures or MCMs). The human and animal responses will be compared and the resulting data will be made available to the community through an open-access resource. It is<br />anticipated that this work may enhance the understanding of the diversity of immune responses elicited by these stimuli both within and across species. Specifically, the project provides a potential means to better understand the potential mechanism(s) of toxicity of biothreat agents, identify off target effects of candidate countermeasures, the mechanism(s) of action for candidate MCMs, and the comparability of these responses in animals and man. This data will be critical for not only facilitating interpretability of animal data but will provide novel and unprecedented potential to assess toxicity and off target effects. In addition the incorporation of studies with biothreat agents may provide new insight into pathogenesis and identify biomarkers as well as<br />providing data that may assist in interpreting studies in animals to support countermeasures being advanced under the Animal Rule. Importantly, many MCMs will or are pursuing licensure through the Animal Rule. The Animal Rule requires "a reasonably well understood pathophysiological mechanism for the toxicity of the chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear substance and its amelioration or prevention by the product as well as a demonstration of<br />effectiveness in one or more species expected to react with a response predictive for humans". This project could provide an additional pathway to generating the necessary data to meet this regulatory standard.

<DESC>The unique properties of nanomaterials allow them to be used as a platform for nanodiagnostic products, in drug delivery and in nanotherapies. These unique properties may give rise to unexpected biological interactions or reactions. How to effectively predict and assess the interactions of nanomaterials with biological systems is a key outcome of the research in this proposal. Key objectives of this project include: synthesis and characterization of graphene-based nanomaterials physiochemical properties; identification of methods to assess and quantify exposure to nanoparticles at cellular level; and assess biological toxicity in vitro.
