<DESC>Solicitation number: ED-IES-11-R-0036
<p>Title: Regional Educational Laboratories 2011-2016</p>
<p>The Department of Education (ED), Institute of Education Sciences (IES), National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE), intends to award five-year contracts for each of the ten laboratory regions as specified in the Education Sciences and Reform Act (ESRA) of 2002, Part D, Section 174 (20 U.S.C. 9564) administered by the Institute of Education Sciences. As required by the authorizing legislation ED shall enter into contracts for a 5-year period.</p>
<p>The purpose is to enter into contracts with entities to establish a networked system of ten regional laboratories that serve the needs of each region of the United States.</p>
<p>The Regional Educational Laboratories (RELs) will carry out a range of activities to serve the needs of each region in the United States in accordance with the provisions stated in the Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) of 2002 . These activities will include applied research, and development, dissemination, training, and technical assistance activities that focus on how to use data and analysis.</p>
<p>The primary mission of the RELs is to help states and districts systematically use data and analysis to answer important issues of policy and practice with the goal of improving student outcomes. Each REL will build research capacity and a knowledge base in states and districts by:<br /><br />(1) Assisting states, districts, and schools in using their data systems;<br />(2) Conducting and supporting high quality research and evaluation analyses that focus on a few key topics; and <br />(3) Helping education policy makers and practitioners incorporate data-based inquiry practices into regular decision-making. <br /><br />The RELs will carry out these priorities primarily by organizing partnerships or networks of practitioners, policy makers, and others in "research alliances." A research alliance is defined as a group of stakeholders (Local Education Agencies, State Education Agencies, and others) who agree to work together to use data to learn more about a specific education concern in order to make sound decisions to improve education outcomes. The structure, size, and focus of each alliance will reflect the needs of the region. RELs are encouraged to form regional, cross-state, or cross-district research alliances where appropriate, and/or to partner with existing alliances. Also, the RELs will conduct rigorous research and evaluation studies that may require 3 to 4 years to plan, implement, and prepare analytic report(s).</p>
<p>Expected Outcomes</p>
<p>The priority for the REL program and the mechanism for delivering REL services are intended to yield several important benefits for the regions and for the nation. These include:</p>
<p>&bull; Development of a cohesive and potentially deep body of knowledge in core, priority areas for each region and nationally, rather than spreading REL work thinly over many issues;<br />&bull; Increased use of evaluation, data, and analysis in how officials identify problems, choose programs and strategies, and learn from initiatives;<br />&bull; Completion of a range of rigorous evaluation and research studies, methodologically appropriate to the questions the studies attempt to answer; <br />&bull; Expansion of state and local capacity to use their own data, conduct high quality research and evaluation, and appropriately incorporate findings into policy and practice; <br />&bull; Distribution of REL work across the region, with a transparent and equitable process for REL assistance; and<br />&bull; Establishment of strong partnerships among practitioners, policy makers, and researchers that are not dependent on ongoing REL support.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be a Full and Open Competition. The NAICS codes used to define this procurement: This procurement is defined as code 541720 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). As such, the applicable Small Business Size Standard for this announcement is $7 million or less in annual receipts. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency. It is anticipated that ten contracts, with a period of performance of 5 years, will be awarded as a result of the RFP. The contract type is anticipated as Firm Fixed Price.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or about March 25, 2011 through the website at http://FedBizOpps.gov. All proposals must be submitted on or before the due date and time stated in the RFP to: Sharon Masciana, Contract Specialist, U.S. Department of Education, Potomac Center Plaza, OCFO/CAM, 550 12th Street, SW, 7th Floor, Washington, DC 20202-4230.

Questions may be directed by email to Sharon Masciana, Contract Specialist, at Sharon.Masciana@ed.gov or telephone at 202-245-6132 or Pamela Bone, Contracting Officer at Pamela.Bone@ed.gov or by telephone at 202-245-6181.</p>

<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811219 and the business size standard in $7.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for one twelve month base period and four twelve month option periods.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all labor, material and equipment to provide preventive maintenance for government-owned: Six (6) Research Counting System 1409's (serial numbers: 4090882, 4091016, 4091132, 4091152, 4091177, 4091179) and one (1) Tri-Carb 2900 serial number 434359.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide: 1) two (2) preventive maintenance inspections per component during the contract period; 2) emergency repair services on an unlimited basis during the term of this contract; 3) all required replacement parts, with the exception of consumable parts to include batteries.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br />The COAC Services Branch, Office of Acquisitions, DERA, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH, for the Laboratory of Molecular Cardiology (LMC), Genetics and Developmental Biology Center (GDBC), Division of Intramural Research, NHLB intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to RetroTherapy LLC, 9430 Key West Avenue, Rockville, MD 20850, for the development and production of cell-membrane permeant Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 bioactive proteins for the reprogramming of human somatic cells into iPS cells.
<p>The reference number: NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2011-109-DDC.</p>
<p>The Government requires the development and production of cell-membrane permeant Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 bioactive proteins for the reprogramming of human somatic cells into iPS cells; as outlined in the statement of work.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The use of inducible pluripoten stem (iPS) cells for both research and possible future therapeutic interventions is presently restricted by 2 major obstacles: <br />1. The first is the only well established method by which human somatic cells can be reprogrammed into iPS cells, that is , the use of forced expression of all or combinations of special transcription factors: (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc (OSKM)) and Nanog proteins in the somatic cell targets. <br />2. The second is the difficulty in obtaining pure populations of the differentiated cells of interest. Due to the exogenous transcription factors are suppressed by epigenetic mechanisms within weeks, the transient use of purified protein factors directly capable of traversing the cell membranes would be a big step forward. This is because the integrated viral sequence from the viral based gene transduction leaves open the possibility of future mutagenesis. Furthermore, the suppressed exogenous viral integrants reduce the fidelity of the iPS cells compared to embryonic stem cells (ES). Unfortunately, researchers to date have not been able to produce these factors in bioactive forms in amounts required for this technique to either be practical or even demonstrable.</p>
<p>Identify the purpose and list the specific objectives of the service:<br />To generate one milligram of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and Nanog proteins using both a baculoviral based system and E. coli based system. The latter must employ a refolding protocol using FPLC.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>The contractor must have broad and deep knowledge of protein chemistry including the use of FPLC. The contractor is required to complete the following tasks:<br />a. To generate the constructs expressing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Nanog proteins for both E. coli. and baculoviral based expression systems.<br />b. To use these constructs in E. coli to generate the factors, extract them in 8M urea and refold them using a multichannel FPLC machine.<br />c. To use the baculaviral based constructs in a baculoviral expression system to produce these proteins as soluble factors which do not require refolding.<br />d. To attach a 9 aminoacid TAT sequence to the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the constructs to make the transcription factors cell-membrane permeable.<br />e. To assist in the use of these factors to generate iPS cells from human CD34+ cells.</p>
<p>Government Responsibilities:</p>
<p>The government will consult with the contractor and oversee the construction of the various vectors and assist in the production of the proteins. The government will also use the proteins to generate the human iPS cells under cell culture conditions.</p>
<p>Deliverables and Reporting Requirements:</p>
<p>The proteins which are produced according to a variable schedule based on laboratory results in generating the iPS cells will be delivered at least once and up to 4 times a month. The government will review the Quality Assurance Data for each batch of proteins including western blots, and assays for concentration and purity.</p>
<p>The period of performance starts on/around April 1, 2011 through October 31, 2011</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that the LMC, GDBC has developed several protocols that have significantly improved the ability to generate bioactive forms of these cell-membrane permeable transcription factors in relatively large amounts. This requirement involves the sophisticated use of a multi-channel Fast Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) machine and very advanced protocols for growing difficult to express proteins in a baculoviral based system. RetroTheraphy LLC, has the knowledge and expertise with this novel used of a multi-channel FPLC to refold insoluble proteins into bioactive proteins. This process was first developed in LMC, GDBC with the collaboration of RetroTherapy LLC. Therefore, it is in the Government's best interest to continue to use the services of RetroTherapy LLC to prevent disruption in the Government's research.</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), 10 Center Drive, Building 10-Room 7N220, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.</p>
<p>The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology with size standard of 500 employees; the small business set-aside does apply for this requirement.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition <br />procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-48 (January 31, 2011).</p>

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from incumbent Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. of 8283 Greensboro Drive, Mclean, Virginia 22102-4904 for 57,618(fifty-seven thousand, six hundred and eighteen) hours of Engineering and Technical Services along with associated Travel, Materials, and NMCI under contract N00421-06-C-0002 for the continuance of technical and engineering services to support continued design, engineering, acquisition, integration, installation, training, operational support, and in-service engineering for Combat Identification, Air Traffic Control, and Electronic Countermeasures systems while the follow-on contract is being completed. This acquisition covers an extended period of performance of approximately six months that will run from 1 April 2011 to 30 September 2011, comprised of a three month base period and three one month options. This procurement is necessary as the current contract is scheduled to run out of ceiling 31 March 2011. Due to the ongoing nature of the projects currently being performed under contract N00421-06-C-0002 and the need to continue these services without a break in work, Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a competitive follow-on contract. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The incumbent contractor (Booz Allen Hamilton) currently has fully trained personnel and a fully developed management system in place for execution of the required work. Resolicitation for the six month period would not only result in a break in service, but would incur excessive costs to the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. For information contact Evan Riedell, Code 2.5.1.2.2.3, via email: evan.riedell@navy.mil.<br />Per FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. is the sole source capable of providing these efforts without creating the impact on the fielded systems, sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in service. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services for this short period of performance prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government would incur and not recover through competition, this will be procured on a sole source basis.<br />

<RESPDATE>071511
<CONTACT>Rebecca Foster, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-696-2972, Email REBECCA.D.FOSTER@NAVY.MIL - Vera M. Carroll, Branch Head ONR Code 251, Phone 703-696-2610, Email vera.carroll@navy.mil
<DESC>In coordination with the Joint Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (JCREW) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Board and the JCREW 3.3 Program Office, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) is soliciting applied research proposals to develop and demonstrate technologies to improve virtually all aspects of performance related to next generation JCREW equipment. Full proposals that address hardware, software, technique, or technology developments are sought in the areas identified below. If an offeror does not submit a white paper before the due date and time, it is not eligible to participate in the remaining Full Proposal submission process and is not eligible for Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 funding.
<p>A. Antennas</p>
<p>New antennas are desired for both mounted and dismounted applications which offer multi-function capability to perform both communications and Counter-Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (C-RCIED) operations and exhibit low profile or low observable characteristics while providing wide-bandwidth frequency coverage with high power output in support of C-RCIED operations. Solutions which maximize bandwidth coverage between mid-Low Frequency (LF) and mid-Extremely High Frequency (EHF), effectively reducing the number of antennas required to cover the mid-LF to mid-EHF frequency range, while decreasing the magnitude of transmitted energy reflected back into the receiver are desired. Additionally, future JCREW antennas will require high efficiencies, high linearity and be capable of supporting high input power on the order of 100's of Watts for mounted and 10's of Watts for dismounted applications. The potential application may require the antenna support techniques for direction finding and geo-location of RF emission sources. Adaptive, dynamic control of antenna parameters including gain pattern, directivity and polarization is also desired. The operational environment will require that antennas be both lightweight and rugged. Techniques for increasing isolation at the antenna between co-located transmit and receive apertures to support simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) are also desired. Offerors must also quantifiably describe how their approach compares to the current state of the art.</p>
<p>B. Receivers/Transmitters</p>
<p>This area includes the development of receiver and transmitter subcomponents, as well as components which support scalable system design, including switches, filters, multi-plexers, etc. that would be integral with developed hardware. All receiver and transmitter solutions will require digitally controllable parameters, functions and output levels to facilitate integration into closed loop C-RCIED systems.</p>
<p>1. Receivers</p>
<p>JCREW systems require rapid threat detection and response over an extremely wide Radio Frequency (RF) bandwidth. New RF receiver and transmitter technologies are desired which will maximize broadband RF coverage at frequencies between the mid-LF to mid-EHF frequency ranges while maintaining wide instantaneous bandwidth with high dynamic range at 10's of kHz resolutions. Hardware will require reduced size, weight, and power requirements with increased response time over current systems. Low insertion loss, low noise and high linearity will be necessary for all RF hardware. Specifically, receivers which maximize instantaneous bandwidth (&gt; 1 GHz), dynamic range (&gt; 80 dB), and demonstrate adaptable resolution bandwidth (10kHz-100kHz) are desired. Compressive receivers capable of very wide bandwidth detections are also of interest. Offerors must quantifiably describe how their approach compares to the current state of the art. (See Section H. entitled Simultaneous Transmit and Receive for additional information.)</p>
<p>2. Transmitters</p>
<p>Transmitters and transmitter components are desired which are capable of supporting &gt;100MHz/channel instantaneous bandwidth, efficiencies &gt; 40%, high linearity, simultaneous transmission of multiple signal and frequencies, 100's of Watts of output for mounted and fixed applications and &lt; 10's of Watts for dismounted applications. Amplifier blanking of &lt; 10 microseconds (us) will be required with prime power draw and power output in &lt; 10 us in order to increase efficiency and reduce Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI). While blanked, transmitter emissions should be &gt;120 dB below peak output. Easily reconfigurable hardware with special consideration for software defined architectures is desired. Offerors must also quantifiably describe how their approach compares to the current state of the art. (See Section H entitled Simultaneous Transmit and Receive for additional information.)</p>
<p>3. Isolation Techniques</p>
<p>Receivers will be required to reliably operate in the presence of out of band, co-site, and high power transmitters. Achieving the isolation necessary (&gt; 100dB) for simultaneous transmit and receive will require layered isolation techniques (material, active cancellation, polarization, etc.). Techniques for maximizing isolation either using a single isolation approach or through the layering of multiple approaches are desired. Techniques which maximize the achievable isolation of a particular approach and could potentially be combined with other isolation techniques to maximize overall system isolation are also of interest. Offerors must also quantifiably describe how their approach compares to the current state of the art. (See Section H entitled Simultaneous Transmit and Receive for additional information.)</p>
<p>C. Modulators and Techniques</p>
<p>JCREW systems require the ability to generate multiple simultaneous and coherent jamming waveforms with low noise in response to detected RF emissions. These jamming responses will require high speed activation at up to GHz bandwidths and digitally controllable parameters and waveform selection to facilitate integration into closed loop architectures.</p>
<p>1. Signal Generators</p>
<p>Waveform generators will require the ability to switch between waveforms at nsec speeds to support on-demand signal delivery to transmitters. Direct Digital Synthesizers (DDS), Arbitrary Waveform Generators (AWG), and Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) technologies or some hybrid of these technologies is of particular interest. Multi-function approaches which support the generation of both Electronic Warfare (EW) waveforms and communication waveforms from a common waveform generator are of particular interest. Offerors must also quantifiably describe how their approach compares to the current state of the art.</p>
<p>2. Intelligent Network Jamming</p>
<p>As networked threat devices become more sophisticated, so will the JCREW systems need for sophisticated networking jamming techniques. Techniques for jamming individual RF devices participating in a network are desired. Such jamming techniques should not disable the RF network itself and should only affect selected devices participating on the network which are supporting IED operations. Offeror should address anticipated network responses to jamming techniques and robustness of jamming to network self-healing techniques</p>
<p>D. Comprehensive Spectral Awareness</p>
<p>1. Extremely Wideband Spectral Mapping</p>
<p>JCREW systems require the ability to rapidly map the RF environment in order to provide real-time RF situational awareness to signal processing and assessment tools. JCREW application will require extremely wide bandwidth with consideration for solutions between mid-LF and mid-EHF. Offerors must also quantifiably describe how their approach compares to the current state of the art.</p>
<p>2. Signal Assessment System (SAS)</p>
<p>JCREW systems will require the ability to rapidly discriminate hostile RF trigger signals from the background RF emissions, or to legitimize users of the RF spectrum based on assessment of the RF environment and activities. Signal assessment will be required in real-time, and while the JCREW system is on-mission the signal assessment must provide for rapid response to developing threats. This capability seeks to maximize countermeasure effectiveness, as well as to reduce power usage, blue force RF fratricide, and false alarms.</p>
<p>3. Direction Finding and Geo-Location</p>
<p>Successful direction finding (DF) or geolocation of threat devices will allow JCREW systems to more effectively focus jamming energy, thereby increasing protection range. Demonstration of capabilities to determine the direction and/or location of received threat emissions is desired with response times on the order of ms, angular accuracy &lt; 35&deg; for Direction Finding (DF) and &lt; 100m accuracy for geolocation. Interoperability between DF/geolocation components and other JCREW components (e.g., Signal Assessment System) is desired. Offerors must also quantifiably describe how their approach compares to the current state of the art.</p>
<p>4. Situational Awareness Data Fusion</p>
<p>Sensor systems, including Electro-Optic (EO)/Infrared (IR) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), operating in a common battlespace with JCREW systems either onboard a common platform or offboard and available via a network can provide valuable situational awareness enhancements to RF spectrum data collected by JCREW alone. Capabilities and techniques are desired for fusing situational awareness data from onboard and offboard sensors with collected RF sensor data.</p>
<p>E. Electromagnetic Compatibility</p>
<p><br />1. Blue Force Comms/Data/Video Interoperability</p>
<p>The ability of the warfighter to perform his functions safely and efficiently requires simultaneous operation of JCREW systems, Blue Force communications, and SIGINT activities. Improved JCREW hardware and software are required, which provide interoperability techniques to support the simultaneous and successful operation of these various systems. As a result, the development of methods and/or techniques to mitigate or eliminate interference and/or coordinate operations between functions is desired. Multi-function techniques, subsystems and component technologies which support both communication and EW functionality are of particular interest.</p>
<p>2. JCREW Network Centric Operations</p>
<p>The ability for JCREW systems to communicate with one another, as well as to both communicate with other platforms and systems in performance of the JCREW mission and transfer pertinent information, would provide a networked approach that maximizes protection capabilities and resources. Networked operations could be used to geolocate all systems or to easily change JCREW system operating parameters. Networked operations could be used to develop a self-forming network topology or network-based jamming algorithms. Analysis of the topology could be used to recommend placements of JCREW hardware over a wide area for optimized operations. Access to event logs, fault logs, and other diagnostics will allow remote users to determine system readiness and possibly to perform limited repair procedures on failed units. This would also significantly reduce support costs and manpower requirements. Development of a secure, wireless link and associated network is needed to demonstrate this capability. Techniques for cross platform allocation and coordination of JCREW resources to maximize effectiveness and efficiency are desired. Additionally, techniques for cross-platform synchronization which do not rely on GPS are desired. Techniques which improve the protection of JCREW systems and mitigate the effects of network attack on JCREW devices are also of interest.</p>
<p>F. Packaging and Cooling</p>
<p>A primary consideration affecting JCREW system design is the cooling necessary for the power amplifier and maintaining internal system temperatures within the operational specifications of the electronic components. Advanced packaging and cooling techniques and materials may yield reductions in size and weight, and increases in efficiencies. These methods and techniques should be investigated. Promising techniques should be modeled and demonstrated through prototype fabrication where appropriate. Focus should be towards maintaining internal system temperatures within electronic component specifications under ambient temperatures of 150 degrees F. Conduction cooling techniques for mounted and dismounted systems are preferred. Offerors must also quantifiably describe how their approach compares to the current state of the art.</p>
<p>G. Scalable Open Architectures</p>
<p>Future JCREW systems will require efficient performance in both single platform and multi-platform operations. As a result, these JCREW systems will require C-RCIED EW architectures which can be networked via Blue Force Communication Links (BFC) links to allow for the distribution of functionality and which are scalable with the number of available platforms, assets and resources. In addition, integration of subsystem components from a wide variety of vendors will require that this scalable architecture be open. The open, scalable architecture will be required to support 1.) coordination of EW functionality over available BFC networks; 2.) closed loop and adaptive parameter control utilizing digital data exchange between subsystems and components (e.g., adaptive instantaneously receive and transmit bandwidth coverage, transmit power, and sector coverage); and 3.) resource control with integrated, government provided, resource allocation management (RAM) tools. Architecture concepts should include techniques and approaches for the real-time distribution of maximum operating spectrum between mid-LF and mid-EHF across available networked JCREW systems and the sub-system distribution of maximum operating spectrum within a single JCREW system. Architectures which facilitate interoperability between communication and CREW functions are of particular interest.</p>
<p>H. Simultaneous Transmit and Receive</p>
<p>ONR is also seeking disruptive electronics and photonics component technology proposals that will eliminate the necessity of blanking the receiver while transmitting when transmitting and receive from a single aperture. Efforts in this category should focus on either controlling transmitter unintended emissions (see B.2), dramatically increased receiver dynamic range (see B.1.), analog subsections which are capable of achieving &gt;&gt;40 dB of isolation of Tx and Rx over 2 octaves of frequency and with small insertion loss and low ripple (see B.3), and digitally driven interference cancellation techniques (see B.3).</p>
<p>Such proposals shall clearly identify how the proposed component technology fits (interfaces) within an overall RF system and impacts interoperability and "cosite interference mitigation" in both the near term as well as longer term. Offerors must also quantifiably describe how their approach compares to the current state of the art.</p>
<p>I. Other JCREW Technologies</p>
<p>Offeror(s) possessing any additional technology, information, or recommendations that would improve existing JCREW systems are encouraged to submit proposal(s) in response to this BAA.</p>
<p>Work funded under a BAA may include basic research, applied research and some advanced technology development (ATD). With regard to any restrictions on the conduct or outcome of work funded under this BAA, ONR will follow the guidance on and definition of "contracted fundamental research" as provided in the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) Memorandum of 24 May 2010. As defined therein the definition of "contracted fundamental research", in a DoD contractual context, includes [research performed under] grants and contracts that are (a) funded by Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Budget Activity 1 (Basic Research), whether performed by universities or industry or (b) funded by Budget Activity 2 (Applied Research) and performed on campus at a university. The research shall not be considered fundamental in those rare and exceptional circumstances where the applied research effort presents a high likelihood of disclosing performance characteristics of military systems or manufacturing technologies that are unique and critical to defense, and where agreement on restrictions have been recorded in the contract or grant.</p>
<p>Pursuant to DoD policy, research performed under grants and contracts that are a) funded by Budget Category 6.2 (Applied Research) and NOT performed on-campus at a university or b) funded by Budget Category 6.3 (Advanced Research) does not meet the definition of "contracted fundamental research." In conformance with the USD(AT&amp;L) guidance and National Security Decision Direction 189, ONR will place no restriction on the conduct or reporting of unclassified "contracted fundamental research," except as otherwise required by statute, regulation or Executive Order. For certain research projects, it may be possible that although the research being performed by the prime contractor is restricted research, a subcontractor may be conducting "contracted fundamental research." In those cases, it is the prime contractor's responsibility in the proposal to identify and describe the subcontracted unclassified research and include a statement confirming that the work has been scoped, negotiated, and determined to be fundamental research according to the prime contractor and research performer.</p>
<p>Normally, fundamental research is awarded under grants with universities and under contracts with industry. ATD is normally awarded under contracts and may require restrictions during the conduct of the research and DoD pre-publication review of research results due to subject matter sensitivity. As regards to the present BAA, the Research and Development efforts to be funded will consist of applied research. The funds available to support awards are Budget Activity 2."</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The reconstruction will extend from Station 133+00 to Station 155+00. The intent of the embankment excavation is to remove the high plasticity clay that is prone to desiccation cracking and replacement of the existing drainage system with a horizontal blanket, chimney drain, and drain pipe at the levee toe to establish positive site drainage to a RD900 pump station. This improvement is intended to address the primary failure mechanisms by reducing the amount of desiccation cracking and saturation of the landside levee slope. The addition of the drain pipe and surrounding drain rock fill at the levee toe is intended to reduce the uplift gradient to acceptable levels. Because, the recommended embankment excavation will extend into the levee crest the crest roadway shall not be used during construction.<BR><BR>It is anticipated that the Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be issued on or about April 7, 2011, for downloading at the Government's website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)<BR>Sources Sought, Requirement, Comments & Industry Day Announcement<BR>RFI Overview: The Army Contracting Command -Redstone (ACC-Redstone) is seeking information concerning the interest and availability of capable contractors to provide contract support to the Aviation and Missile Command's (AMCOM) Aviation Maintenance Enterprise.  The Aviation Maintenance Enterprise efforts covered by this RFI will include the following:<BR>a.	AMCOM Logistics Support Facility Management Activity (LSFMA) contract: The LSFMA is a Government office that provides contractual support to Army Aviation programs and activities for non-recurring and recurring modification efforts on Aviation platforms and support equipment. The AMCOM LSFMA support contract requires the successful offerors to provide the engineering, logistics, maintenance support, training, and associated support for these modification efforts.  Please see the DRAFT Performance Work Statement for a list of covered work.<BR>b.	AMCOM Aviation Field Maintenance (AFM) contract:  This contract will provide field and sustainment maintenance for Army aviation platforms in support of the mission area managed or supported by AMCOM and the Program Executive Office (PEO) - Aviation.  The contract will require the contractor to accomplish the following:  maintenance and delivery of Army Aviation aircraft, to include RESET IAW established Technical Bulletins and Directives, the installation of Modification Work Orders (MWOs), support to installation Directorate of Logistics (DOL) aviation activities and support to Combat Aviation Brigades (CAB).  Please see the DRAFT Performance Work Statement for a list of covered work.<BR><BR>Contract Background and Anticipated Period of Performance:  It is anticipated that the LSFMA and AFM contracts will be indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  It is also anticipated that these requirements will be multiple award contracts. The IDIQ contract will bind the successful contractors to labor rates and other factors for pricing individual orders and any modifications to orders.  Individual orders under the multiple award concept will be competed as required.  It is anticipated the contracts will include a five year ordering period.  Orders may be issued as either Firm Fixed Price or Cost Plus Fixed Fee type instruments with possible performance incentives.  The LSFMA contract may require the contractor to have a facility within 60 miles of Redstone Arsenal.  The anticipated AFM contract will consist of major geographic regions throughout the United States including approximately 18-20 maintenance sites, with the number of AFM sites changing as operational requirements evolve. It will also include support to OCONUS locations.  Important note, it is anticipated that the vast majority of orders under these contracts will be issued as end item supply type contracts and the use of orders for services will be limited.  These contracts will include DFARS 252.228-7001 Ground and Flight Risk clause.  Awarded contracts will support all PEO Aviation platforms as required.  For information purposes, the current LSFMA contract was competed as a small business set aside.  The applicable NAICS code for both the LSFMA and AFM effort is 336411 - Aircraft Manufacturing.  The size standard is 1500 employees.  <BR>Capable Contractor Interest: The ACC - Redstone would like to identify businesses that have experience in all or a part of the requirements described above.  If you believe your company is a viable source and would like to receive an announcement when the requirements are synopsized in the FedBizOpps, contact the Contracting Officer's point of contact (POC) via e-mail or in writing with your mailing or e-mail address.  Note on your request if you are a large or small business as it relates to the listed NAICS code, which effort(s) you are interested in, and if you are interested in the capacity of a prime or looking for subcontract opportunities. <BR>Performance Work Statements (PWS): Interested contractors are requested to review the accompanying DRAFT PWS for the LSFMA and AFM efforts and respond to the contracting officer POC with any comments, innovative ideas, performance or quality incentives and measurements, best industry practices, or acquisition streamlining that might enhance the PWS or the Aviation Maintenance Enterprise program.  Please note that these are overarching DRAFT PWSs that describe the mission areas and a description of the type of work that may be issued as orders under the IDIQ contract. <BR>Note: The DRAFT PWSs include job descriptions from the previous contracts associated with these efforts.  These job descriptions are not final but are meant to provide potential offerors a representative sample of the personnel and skills required to perform the required effort. It is expected that these job descriptions and the associated qualifications will be updated prior to release of any RFP.  Also included in the information are attachments associated with the facility and equipment requirements of the contract.  The LSFMA attachment includes the equipment that a successful offeror will require to perform the orders issued under the resulting contract.  The LSFMA equipment is expected to be provided by the contractor as capital equipment. The AFM contract will be performed at Government sites.  The AFM attachment is a list of equipment that the Government expects to provide at the work sites.  The individual orders will contain the specific equipment to be provided as Government Furnished Equipment/Government Furnished Property.  The contractor will be expected to maintain and calibrate the equipment while it is in their possession and to provide any other equipment necessary to perform the work. <BR>Performance and Quality Incentive Comments:  Ideas to incentivize exceptional quality and/or performance, as well as how to measure their success, are requested.<BR>Industry Day: An industry day related to these acquisitions is to take place in Huntsville, Al. at the Westin Huntsville, located at 6800 Governors West, NW, Huntsville, Al (6782 Old Madison Pike) the Bridge Street Town Centre, on March 31, 2011.    Attendance is limited to five individuals from any one company.  Separate briefings will be held for each of the proposed actions described above. Each briefing will last approximately 60 minutes.  Please identify which briefing(s) your firm desires to attend and provide an email point of contact to the contracting officer POC.   The AFM brief will take place at 9:00 A.M., CST.  The LSFMA brief will take place at 1:00 P.M., CST.  <BR>This RFI pertains to sources sought, comments on DRAFT PWSs, performance incentive arrangements and an announcement for an Industry Day relating to these acquisitions.  This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Any information provided to the Government is strictly voluntary and at no cost to the Government.  Any formal solicitation(s) will be announced separately.  It is anticipated that a draft solicitation for industry's comments may be released in the third quarter of Calendar Year (CY) 2011 with a final solicitation (Request for Proposal) issued in the fourth quarter of CY 2011 for the two actions; however, these dates are estimates and subject to change without notice.  The Government is anticipating awarding multiple IDIQ contracts for the LSFMA and AFM efforts. Source Selection will be conducted per applicable guidance of FAR part 15, DFARS part 215 and AFARs part 5115 (to include Army Source Selection Manual, AFARs appendix AA, February 2009 or current date) as well as Army Contracting Command and AMCOM directives.  Current Government source selection guidance at time of evaluation will be implemented.  Note that only comments and not questions are solicited under this RFI. Send all comments relating to the DRAFT PWS or cost incentive ideas to the listed Contracting Officer POC.  Contacts to Government personnel by potential offerors regarding this RFI subject are restricted and must proceed through the Contracting Officer POC.

Information includes the DRAFT PWS for both solicitations and attachments. <BR>Small Business Set-Aside Determination: It is anticipated that the current LSF program will continue as a Small Business Set Aside. However, the Government reserves the right to decide whether or not a Small Business set -aside, full or partial, is appropriate for either acquisition based on responses to this notice. In order for the Government to make a Small Business set-aside determination, it is emphasized that Small Business concerns provide sufficient written information to indicate their capability to successfully perform and manage all requirements of the magnitude described in the Draft PWSs. It is heavily contemplated that the extent to which a prime contractor provides for the significant use of small and small-disadvantaged business subcontractors will be a consideration in the evaluation of proposals.<BR>Point of Contact<BR>Email is the preferred method of communication.

In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<BR>	3.

Auto-Cad 
"	AutoCAD, or Computer Aided Design, is a 2D and 3D design program that is commonly used for design and drafting.
As-Built Layouts
"	Drawings deemed "as-built" are thus drawings that show the EXISTING conditions as they are or "as-is" - these are the actual existing conditions as opposed to designs or proposed conditions.
Arc Flash Labels
"	Labels that display specific information such as available energy, approach distances, or required Personal Protective Equipment.
Cable Locator	
"	Typically consisted of two parts--a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter puts an electrical signal onto the cable being traced, while the receiver picks up that signal, allowing the locator operator to trace the signal`s path and follow the cable being located.
Duct Banks
"	Protects electrical lines that are beneath the ground from accidental breakage. They consist of electrical cables within round ducts (typically PVC pipe) encased in reinforced concrete. 
De-energize 
"	To deprive of electrical energy or exhaust the electrical energy
Layout Drawings
"	Layout drawings make use of standard symbols which indicate the direction of flow. In electrical diagrams, convey graphically the ideas and information necessary for the analysis of a system(s).
Label Convention
"	Used with AutoCAD to enable its automation features to work; electrical-smart symbols. (Example HSP1001.dwg translates "Horizontal Splice #1") (Example VSP1001.dwg translates "Vertical Splice #1") (Example HSP1001.dwg translates "Horizontal Splice #3")
Manhole
"	A manhole (alternatively utility hole, maintenance hole or access chamber) is the top opening to an underground utility vault used to house an access point for making connections or performing maintenance on underground and buried utility (electrical).
Relays
"	An electrical relay, or simply a relay, is a switch that enables an electrical signal to control the flow of current through another such signal.  A relay enables a small signal to control current flow through a larger signal by switching on or off. 
Short Circuit/Coordination Study
"	The primary purpose of a coordination study is to determine satisfactory ratings and settings for the electric system protection devices. 
Switch
"	An electrical switch is a device that stops, allows or manipulates the flow of current inside a circuit. It does this with the use of a set of contacts. When the contacts touch, the switch is closed, and current can flow. When the contacts do not touch, the switch is open, and current is prevented from flowing.
Single Line Diagram
"	A Single Line Diagram of an Electrical System is the Line Diagram of the Electrical System which includes all the required ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT connection sequence from the point of entrance of Power up to the end of the scope of the mentioned work. 
Transformers
"	A transformer is a device for changing the voltage of electricity. Transformer steps high voltage electricity down to the level necessary for domestic use.
Underground Distribution
"	An electrical supply system employing underground structures, cables, and other equipment located under designated areas.

<DESC>This announcement is issued as a special notice to award a brand name order to Redwood Software, Inc. 3000 Aerial Center Pkwy., Ste. 115, Morrisville, NC 27560-7677. The Defense Logistics Agency requires annual maintenance renewals for Report2Web (R2W) software applications.
<p>DESCRIPTION: <br />CLIN 001: R2W v2.5 Single-Processor VAR development license, POP: 5/31/11 through 5/31/12, QTY: 01 EA.</p>
<p>CLIN 002: R2W v2.5 SQL Server Edition Dual-Processor license, POP: 5/31/11 through 5/31/12, QTY: 03 EA.</p>
<p>CLIN 003: Report Burster Dual-Processor license, POP: 5/31/11 through 5/31/12, QTY: 03 EA.</p>
<p>CLIN 004: Report Router Dual-Processor license, POP: 5/31/11 through 5/31/12, QTY: 01 EA.</p>
<p>Redacted Justification: The Defense Logistics Agency has determined that the renewal of the maintenance on existing R2W software is necessary because of the critical roles the software fills. The renewal of maintenance allows the Government to keep software patches current and vendor support, in the event of an outage or due to security vulnerability. Any interruption in the maintenance support would be critical to completion of vital cataloging and provisioning production workload and ultimately inhibit the Defense Logistics Agencies ability to support the Warfighter. Per Redwood Software, Inc., only Redwood can maintain this proprietary software. There are no vendors or partners authorized to maintain the software. Maintenance on existing software is significantly more cost effective than procuring alternative software to fill this critical role.</p>
<p>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Award will be made to Redwood Software, Inc. as they are the original manufacturer of the hardware and/or software and are the only known source that can provide the required support. If there are any other firms who can satisfy this requirement, please submit a proposal by 4:00 PM. EST on March 15, 2011.</p>

<DESC>This announcement serves as a Sources Sought Notice issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. This Sources Sought Notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation nor is this notice a Request for Proposals (RFP). <strong>DLA Troop Support is NOT requesting a quote or proposal in response to this notice</strong>. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by DLA Troop Support for any purpose. The Government does not intend to pay for information furnished pursuant to this RFI. The purpose for this Sources Sought Notice is to conduct market research to identify parties having an interest in, and the resources to support, this requirement. For the purpose of this acquisition, the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 335129 - Other Lighting Equipment Manufacturing and the applicable size standard is 500 employees.
<p>DLA Troop Support seeks your expression of interest and any suggestion regarding DLA Troop Support's desire to establish supply support of a: <strong>Light Set, Chart, Field (NSN 6230-01-503-3158). </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Component Information</span>: The Army's transition to modular brigades, which is one of the major initiatives of the Army's transformation plan for modernization, involves migrating the Army from a division-centric force designed to fight one or two potential major-theatre wars toward a modular, brigade-centric force that is expeditionary in nature and deployed continuously in different parts of the world. This transformation spreads platoon and team sized elements across the battlefield, such that the 24/7 availability of electrical power is not always possible, and as such, an alternative provision for lighting without Mobile Electric Power (MEP) is necessary. Many small Command Posts (CPs) need lighting within tents and facilities and do not have a generator available, and the use of candles and lanterns can be unsafe and present logistic problems (batteries, fuel, etc), leaving units to find substitutes that present more problems than they solve.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements</span>:<strong> The Government has a need for portable battery powered illumination within operations centers, Command Posts (CPs), areas without other lighting, and for emergency and inspection purposes in a field environment when the use of generators is restricted or electrical power is unavailable. </strong>These light sets are also used during searches, inspections, field medical work, and urban operations, and provide a safer, longer duration, rechargeable lighting solution. There are numerous situations when running a generator is not advisable and connecting to a commercial power grid is not an option, but the work within a dark tent or shelter must continue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Design and Construction</span>: The function of the Lighting Kit is to provide extended power, battery operated lighting at more than three times the life of a single battery charge/capacity. In a portable package, the soldier unit is able to charge up to 12 batteries at the same time, using any one of four different power sources. When battery powered lighting is required - four soldiers using belt packs can operate the 18 Volt (V) cordless floodlights and the 18V rotating headlights for at least nine hours each instead of the standard time provided by a single battery.</p>
<p><strong>This Lighting Kit requires two (2) Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) headlights and floodlights, twelve (12) battery packs, two (2) solar panels, four (4) belt packs, four (4) different "pig tail" power cords, a built-in controller/charger, spare bulbs and lens covers, all contained within an impact resistant, water-resistant storage/transport case on wheels. The transport case requires integrated recharging and battery maintenance management circuitry (i.e. the controller/charger), that can be recharged and powered using four different voltage sources: 12 VDC, 24 VDC, 110 VAC, and 220 VAC.</strong> The controller accepts electricity from the four different voltage sources and feeds it into the charger, which can charge and maintain up to 12 batteries at once. The soldier cannot connect a light directly to the controller/charger, because these lights can only be powered by a battery source (either from a single battery, or from the belt pack). To compensate for that, the kit includes four (4) triple battery belt packs that allow three of the 18V lighting batteries to be attached within each belt pack to power either the 18V cordless floodlight or 18V rotating headlight, providing 3X the lighting capability for four different soldiers at the same time. While a standard 18V battery powered lighting device has an estimated run time of about three hours, the belt packs allows the soldier to operate the Lighting Kit flashlights for nine or more hours from a single belt pack charge. <strong>The transport case is specially designed to fit in the rear of a HMMWV and has custom cut foam to safeguard the components during rough handling.</strong> The Light Set provides an instant inventory of lighting equipment, and contains a permanently affixed diagram showing the location of each component in its loaded position and includes identification data.</p>

<DESC>Through this Opportunity Notice (NOTICE), NASA seeks to identify potentialSponsoring Organizations who may be interested in partnering with Allied Organizations tosupport prize competitions conducted under Centennial Challenges program(http://www.nasa.gov/challenges        ) of NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. The Challenges are:The Strong Tether Challenge is to create tethers with the highest strength-to-weightratio and demonstrate a material that is at least 50 percent stronger than the strongestcommercially available.  This challenge has a prize purse of $2.0 million. The objectiveis to stimulate innovations in high strength-to-weight materials.  Super-strong tetherswill enable many great advances in aerospace capability, including reduction in rocketweight, habitable space structures, solar sails, and various tether-based propulsionsystems, culminating in the ability to construct a Space Elevator.  The Strong TetherChallenge has been managed by the Spaceward Foundation  http://www.spaceward.org	 .The Power Beaming Challenge is a practical demonstration of wireless power transmission.This Challenge has a prize purse of $1.1 million. The objective is to foster innovationsin new power distribution technologies that have applications to many aspects of spaceexploration, both surface and space based.  Near term applications include point-to-pointpower transmission for robotic and human expeditions to planetary surfaces. ThisChallenge also supports the development of far-term space infrastructure concepts such asspace elevators and solar power satellites.  The Power Beaming Challenge has been managedby the Spaceward Foundation  http://www.spaceward.org	       .The Green Flight Challenge: Teams will fly aircraft they designed to travel 200 miles inless than two hours using the energy equivalent of less than one gallon of gasoline peroccupant. This Challenge has a prize purse of $1.65 million.  The Challenge objective isto stimulate development and demonstration of a broad spectrum of technologies to achievevery high energy efficiencies in quiet and practical aircraft.	 The challenge will beheld in July 2011.

The prize purse is $1.5 million.  Theobjective is to stimulate innovations in energy storage technologies of value in extremespace environments, such as the surface of the moon, or for electric vehicles andrenewable energy systems on Earth.  An Allied Organization is being sought to manage thisChallenge.The Nano-Satellite Launch Challenge is to place a small satellite into Earth orbit, twicein one week.  The prize purse is $2.0 million.	The objectives of this challenge are tostimulate innovations in low-cost launch technology for frequent access to Earth orbitand encourage creation of commercial nano-satellite delivery services.	An AlliedOrganization is being sought to manage this Challenge.CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES BACKGROUND Centennial Challenges is a program of incentive prizes to generate novel solutions toproblems of interest to NASA and the nation. The mission of the program is to [1] driveprogress in aerospace technology of value to NASAs missions, [2] encourage theparticipation of independent teams, individual inventors, student groups and privatecompanies of all sizes in aerospace research and development; and [3] find the mostinnovative solutions to technical challenges through competition and collaboration. Since 2005, nineteen Centennial Challenges competitions have been held in six technicalareas. A total of $4.5 million has been awarded in prizes to thirteen different teams.The competition events, especially in the head-to-head contest format, typically involvepublic spectators, televised or webcasted coverage and are high-visibility opportunitiesfor public outreach. Additional information can be found at www.nasa.gov/challenges. ROLE OF ALLIED ORGANIZATIONS Allied Organizations are those NASA partners that conduct the Centennial Challengescompetitions. NASA provides the prize purse for the competitions, but no funding for theconduct of the competition itself. Allied Organizations may provide additional fundingfrom other sources subject to NASAs approval. Allied Organizations are selected througha competitive process and agreements are negotiated directly between the AlliedOrganization and NASA. Allied Organizations cannot compete in the Challenges for whichthey have responsibility. Because no NASA funds are provided to fund the conduct of the Challenges, AlliedOrganizations must administer the Challenges with their own funding or they must acquirethe funding needed to administer the Challenges through partnerships with SponsoringOrganizations or through other means. Allied Organizations are also encouraged tosupplement the prize purse with funding from outside organizations, such as a SponsoringOrganization. ROLE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONSSponsoring Organizations are partners of the Allied Organization that contribute fundstowards the prize purse, towards the administrative expenses associated with theChallenge, and/or provide in-kind support for the Challenge.  Sponsoring Organizationsare expected to enter into agreements directly with the Allied Organization administeringthe sponsored Challenge.  These agreements are subject to NASA approval.  NASA does notanticipate entering into agreements directly with any Sponsoring Organization.	ASponsoring Organization cannot compete in the Challenge to which it contributes.Because the success of Challenges hinges on the ability of NASAs Allied Organizations tosuccessfully administer and conduct the prize competitions, NASA wishes, through thisNOTICE, to identify interested Sponsoring Organizations that seek the opportunity topartner with an Allied Organization to support one or more Challenges.	NASA expects thatindividual Challenges will demonstrate technologies or operational capabilities, andproduce high profile competition events that may enhance the visibility and reputation ofthe Sponsoring Organization.  In return for its contributions, a Sponsoring Organizationwould be associated with a specific Challenge.	Depending upon the agreement a SponsoringOrganization negotiates with an Allied Organization, a Sponsoring Organization may beentitled to negotiate naming rights or other public-facing acknowledgement and/or providetimely input to the structure and rules of the Challenge to which it contributes. NASAdoes not anticipate permitting Structure and Rule changes after they have been approvedand posted in the Federal Register.Sponsoring Organizations may include but are not limited to: for-profit companies andcorporations, universities and other non-profit or educational organizations, andprofessional or public organizations, as well as individuals.

<DESC>Through this Opportunity Notice (NOTICE) NASA seeks to select an AlliedOrganization for the Nano-Satellite Launcher prize competition (hereinafter Challenge)to be conducted under the Centennial Challenges Program of NASA Headquarters inWashington, D.C.Allied Organizations are responsible for the following elements as they relate toindividual Challenges:	Challenge Planning.	Sponsor Recruitment.	Competitor Recruitment.	Challenge Administration and Execution.	Challenge Publicity.NASA provides the monetary prize purse (which can be supplemented by outsideorganizations) but no funding for the conduct of the competition itself.  AlliedOrganizations must administer the Challenges with their own funding or they must acquirethe funding needed to administer the Challenges through agreements with sponsoringorganizations or through other means.  Sponsoring organizations are those entities that team with an Allied Organization toaugment the prize purse, provide funding for administrative expenses and/or providein-kind support through separate agreements with the Allied Organization.  SPACE ACT AGREEMENTSNASA anticipates entering into an unfunded Space Act Agreement with a selected AlliedOrganization to manage the Nano-Satellite Launcher Challenge. Selection of an AlliedOrganization will be through a competitive process based on evaluation of submittedproposals. Participation as an Allied Organization will be contingent upon selection byNASA and negotiation of an appropriate agreement between NASA and the proposer. The SpaceAct Agreement will detail the contributions and responsibilities of NASA and the AlliedOrganization for a specific Challenge. The agreement will address intellectual propertyrights, concurrence on rules, team agreements, media rights, insurance, registration feesand eligibility, and typically include a term of 3 years. NASA reserves the right toselect for Space Act Agreement negotiations all, some, or none of the proposals submittedin response to this NOTICE. Respondents will be responsible for funding their ownactivities associated with responding to this NOTICE and conducting the Challenge. TheAllied Organization may collect reasonable registration fees from competitors but the useof registration fees as a primary means to cover Challenge administration costs isdiscouraged. ELIGIBILITYDomestic non-profit organizations are eligible to submit proposals in response to thisNOTICE.  Allied Organizations cannot compete in the Challenge that they manage.  AlliedOrganizations and their officers and employees may not have a financial or other interestin any teams that compete in any Challenge(s) they manage.Multiple organizations may form a team to manage the Challenge and may submit a jointproposal.CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES BACKGROUNDNASA Centennial Challenges was established to conduct prize competitions to generateinnovative solutions to technical problems of interest to NASA and the nation.	Thosecompeting for the NASA monetary prizes can be individuals, independent teams, studentgroups, research organizations or private companies but they cannot receive governmentfunding to support any of their work related to the technical area of the prizeChallenge.  The program seeks unconventional solutions from non-traditional sources and, thereby,hopes to identify new talent and stimulate the creation of new businesses.  Unlikecontracts and grants based on proposals, prizes are only awarded after competitors havesuccessfully demonstrated their innovations.  Competitors retain ownership of theirintellectual property. To be eligible to win a NASA Centennial Challenge monetary prize, an individual orentity(1) shall have registered to participate in the competition pursuant to any rulespromulgated by NASA;(2) shall have complied with all the rules of the competition and requirements ofapplicable law; (3) in the case of a private entity, shall be incorporated in and maintain a primaryplace of business in the United States, and in the case of an individual, whetherparticipating singly or in a group, shall be a citizen or permanent resident of theUnited States; and(4) shall not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of theiremployment.The Centennial Challenges in the past have typically required several annual competitionsto occur before the total prize purses have been claimed.  Competitions have beenconducted in a first-to-demonstrate format and in a head-to-head contest format.  Thecompetition events, especially in the head-to-head contest format, typically involvepublic spectators, televised or Webcasted coverage and are high-visibility opportunitiesfor public outreach.  Additional information can be found at www.nasa.gov/challengesNEW CENTENNIAL CHALLENGEThe specific Challenge for which an Allied Organization is sought with this NOTICE is theNano-Satellite Launch Challenge to place a small satellite into Earth orbit, twice in oneweek.  The prize purse is $2 million.A description of the Challenge outlining NASAs objectives is provided in the appendix tothis NOTICE.  Further refinements and creative enhancements of the Challenge objectivesby the Allied Organizations, with concurrence by NASA, are encouraged.SELECTION CRITERIANASA will select an Allied Organization based on the following evaluation criteria:1)	Capabilities of the organization to administer the Challenge and competitionevents including ability to:a.	encourage the participation of individuals, groups, students, and businesses,especially those outside the traditional aerospace community and those from minority andunder-represented communities so as to attract a diverse field of competitors with widegeographic distribution. b.	conduct competition events safely and impartially.c.	formulate competition rules, judging criteria, and competition plans inconsultation with NASA and with appropriate public comment.d.	provide, as necessary, appropriate competition venues and supporting equipment.e.	access technical expertise in the area of the Challenge and select qualified andimpartial judges.  f.	conduct competitor registration and establish agreements with competitorscovering legal, insurance, and other issues.g.	maintain communication with competitors and with NASA.h.	organize ancillary activities, including parallel student-class competitions(university, high school, or other levels) to enhance and broaden the impact of theChallenge. i.	publicize and promote the goals of the Challenge through creative use of publicmedia including websites.

Innovations in propulsion and other technologies as well as operations andmanagement for broader applications in future launch systems.	A commercial capability for dedicated launches of small satellites at a costcomparable to secondary payload launches--a potential new market with Government,commercial, and academic customers.DescriptionDeliver a payload with a mass of at least one kilogram and dimensions of at least10x10x11 centimeters to Earth orbit, complete at least one orbit past the launch site anddeliver payloads successfully at least two times in one week.  The specified payload matches the standard 1U CubeSat.	One orbit past the launch siteimposes an absolute minimum orbital velocity requirement and an injection maneuver toachieve orbit.	Repeatability within a time constraint deters one-time stunts that wouldnot lead to a useful launch capability.  This is anticipated to be a first-to-demonstratechallenge.Allied Organizations will have to verify that payloads have been placed in orbit viaground tracking or other means, which might be done through partnerships with NASA, theU.S. Air Force, private entities, or through sponsorships.  Range safety costs andprocedures will be a critical issue for competitors, but some existing and new ranges mayoffer incentives to attract competitors.  The Federal Aviation Administration will havean important role in permitting and/or licensing of competitors.Prize Purse $2 million is available from the Centennial Challenges Program.  If additional prizefunds become available from the Government or other sources, a second-place prize andsupplemental prizes might be offered for the primary objective or additionalaccomplishments. Outreach OpportunitiesExample: Competitors could offer payload space to student payloads.  University teams mayattempt the Challenge itself but a student-level competition for a suborbital flight to avery high altitude (i.e. 100 miles) might be considered.  Such efforts should becoordinated with the NASA Student Launch Initiative and other existing programs. Additional NASA prize money may be available for student-level competitions.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP). THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVALIABLE AT THIS TIME. This is a market research tool to determine whether to set-aside an acquisition for services for Small Business (SB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business or 8(a) concerns only. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Atlantic (NAVFAC), implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. An award will not be made on offers received in response to this notice.
 The Government is not responsible for the cost associated with any effort expended in responding to this notice. Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Synopsis, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition in lieu of full and open competition is in the Governments best interest.

Any potential acquisition would be a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for the reengineering of the ongoing changes to the Navys Housing Referral and Furnishings Programs. The contractor will conduct research in order to assist in the development and implementation of a reengineered Housing Referral Services Program. The research will include but is not limited to site visits, review of current directives and review of best business practices in the Housing Referral/relocation industry and other similar efforts in order to draft proposed policies and implementation procedures for the Navy Referral and Furnishings Programs.
 The proposed policies and procedures will need to take into account the process used by the Navy for transfer of personnel to new duty stations. The contractor will support the execution of the necessary project management and technical support actions to tie together the associated technology, policy, marketing, staffing, training, accreditation and implementation actions which are inter-related parts of a new reengineered approach to Navy Housing Referral and to the overall housing program. Services include, but are not limited to, developing quarterly program reviews and status reports, facilitate working group meetings and support all conference calls, support development of and tracking of an implementation strategy and reporting procedures to communicate project implementation progress, assist with the development of Navy Housing Referral Program, including PPV referral, cost savings programs, web improvements, policy changes, desk guides, training, marketing programs/initiatives, surveys and analyses, etc.
 The contractor will also be required to conduct site visits to obtain information as necessary and conduct on-site deployment training of new process and procedures for Installation Housing staffs. This technical expertise and support by the contractor is considered to be mission essential. A portion of the contract requires the contractor to coordinate with the Navy to plan, develop, and implement the Navys requirements for the weeklong Professional Housing Management Association, Professional Development Seminar (PHMA PDS) to include Navy Service Day and the Navy Housing Awards ceremony. Places of performance include: Commander, Naval Installations Command (CNIC) Headquarters, CNIC Regions, CNIC Installations (worldwide), CNIC Base Commands (worldwide), and the contractors workplace.

Prime contractors must note that at least fifty percent (50%) of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime. Prime shall indicate whether it will perform and provide 50% or more of the work and personnel without relying on subcontractors. The Government reserves the right to request additional information as needed, from any and all respondents.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement, a market survey for information to be used for preliminary planning purposes. The information received will be used within the Navy to facilitate the decision making process and will not be disclosed outside of the agency. A decision will be made whether to issue the proposed solicitation as a competitive set-aside for Small Business, U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a), SBA certified HUBZone, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns, or whether to issue as full and open competition (unrestricted). This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals, and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.
 No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.

Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Southwest is seeking Small Business, SBA certified 8(a), SBA certified HUBZone, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business sources with current relevant experience, personnel, and capability to perform a multiple award construction contract for new construction, repair, alteration, and renovation, by design-build or fully-designed project, of dredging and disposal, demolition, and construction related operations, both in and above water, of waterfront facilities, such as, but not limited to: piers, wharves, quay walls, bulkheads, sea walls, dry docks, boat ramps, docks and marinas, shore protection, rip rap, breakwaters, wave attenuation, mooring dolphins, buoys, primary and secondary fendering, pile driving, and sheet piles.
 The work also includes the design and construction of all utilities and other facilities in the waterfront area related to waterfront operations to support Navy vessels and port operations.

<DESC><strong>General:</strong> This RFI does not commit the government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of any information or in making necessary samples for the preparation thereof. The RFI does not commit the government to procure or contract for said services regarding this market research.&nbsp; <strong>RFI Focus:</strong> The U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA) is interested in obtaining, testing and evaluating any technologies or materials with potential application in authentication features in CA issued secure documents (SD), including but not limited to, the passport, the visa, and the passport card. Offers should provide effective counterfeit and alteration deterrence against all types of fraudulent document threats. Proposals may be intended for incorporation into SD materials, applied to SD or modifications of blank SD manufacturing and/or personalization, and have at least one aspect that does not require a device for verification.&nbsp; Any offers submitted for consideration will be reviewed for inherent and relative effectiveness as a security feature and may be further assessed for compatibility with SD design and production processes, SD as issued durability, environmental acceptability, and all other manufacturing, accountability, storage, and personalization processing requirements. An effective feature is defined as one that cannot be easily simulated or reproduced so that the simulation or reproduction would deceive authentication examination.&nbsp; The Bureau will only consider technologies or materials for which at least laboratory feasibility has already been demonstrated (that is, a physical sample or product of the offered process can be shown).&nbsp; For initial screening purposes, interested parties are requested to submit preliminary samples and technical descriptions, no longer than one page, plus price information for possible purchase of larger test quantities. The Bureau may submit offers to outside technical experts who have agreed to keep samples secure and results confidential for their evaluation subject to the approval of CA and the submitting party.&nbsp; <br />The DoS is responsible for ensuring that appropriately marked proprietary information contained in information provided is protected from unauthorized disclosure. However, it is the company's responsibility to ensure that all information deemed proprietary is appropriately marked. The company shall include the following notice as a cover page to its information: This information shall be used and disclosed for evaluation purposes only, and a copy of this Government notice shall be applied to any reproduction or abstract thereof. Any authorized restrictive notices which the submitter places on this information shall also be strictly complied with. Disclosure of this information outside the Government for evaluation purposes shall be made only to the extent authorized by, and in accordance with, the procedures in Section 615.413-2(f) of the Department of State Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR Chapter 6).&nbsp; Companies shall provide its GSA Federal Supply Schedule Contract Number and Special Item Number (SIN) if applicable.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) for information and planning purposes only. No awards will be made from the responses to this announcement. However, responses may be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a future acquisition.
<p>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Tactical Electronic Warfare Division, Surface Electronic Warfare Systems Branch (Code 5740) requests information and rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimates of cost for providing RF High Power Amplifiers (HPA) that could be used in shipboard electronic warfare (EW) applications. An RF HPA is defined as both an amplifier and a power supply that are integrated into one package. NRL requests information on RF HPAs that are commercially available or with minimum modification could begin delivery in 9 to 12 months. The cost ROM should be based on a potential future purchase of a minimum of 25 HPAs and a maximum of 160 HPAs.<br />The purpose of this RFI is to gauge industry interest, capabilities, and relevant heritage experience and know-how for providing RF HPAs that are suitable for shipboard evaluation in an EW prototype system. As such, NRL will be using responses and ROM cost estimates for determination of EW system design capabilities and affordability.</p>
<p>The RF HPA Nominal Characteristics provided in Table #1 (also available as a separate table in Attachment 1 on our web site http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/listsource.htm ) represent RF HPA characteristics that are considered desirable to a shipboard EW system.

<DESC>John Day Dam is pursuing the purchase to replace 230 high bay lighting fixtures in the John Day Dam Powerhouse. The existing fixtures are failing, provide poor light spectrum and elevated noise levels in the powerhouse. <BR><BR>The power requirements for the John Day Dam high bay fixtures are as follows: <BR>Transformers are 4160 to 480 delta-delta with 480 volts 3 phase to each supply breaker. One 480 vac leg is dropped of at each fixture to reflect 480 vac single phase at each fixture. This in turn distributes the load throughout the system. <BR><BR>This power requirement is not typical to industry standards. The performance results of the new light fixtures to be procured shall improve the powerhouse lighting to a more natural light, the noise level shall be reduced (as electronic ballasts produce no noise) and an increased longevity in the lamps or ballasts. <BR><BR>If you're interested in providing a quote for this NON-TYPICAL power requirement high bay light fixture acquisition, please contact Kathryn Newhouse via email at Kathryn.A.Newhouse@usace.army.mil with your company's name, DUNS number, point of contact, and phone number as well as an explanation of the product that you would be providing to meet this need and it's power requirement details.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG).
<p>The USCG Aviation Logistics Center is conducting market research to determine manufactures and suppliers described as follows: Purchase of spare APS-143C (V) 3 airborne pulse compression surveillance and imaging radar components used on the USCG Maritime Patrol Aircraft (HC-144A). This system was designed to provide the airborne platform with the means to search for and detect surface targets while performing over water surveillance. The APS-143C (V) 3 radar system consists of three major components: the receiver/transmitter, the signal data processor, and the antenna pedestal. The Receiver/Transmitter (R/T) (737-4000-001) generates linear FM dispersed or Continuous Wave (CW) pulses of X-Band Radio Frequency (RF) energy and detects, compresses, filters and amplifies the low-level echoes received from this pulse. The R/T has several modes of RF operation. Each mode is controlled from the Signal processor (SP) via an ARINC-429 data link. The Antenna Pedestal (A/P) (737-5000-002) focuses and directs energy furnished by the R/T. It is pitch and roll stabilized and can operate at 6, 12, 30 and 60 rpm in continuous scan mode and in a sector scan mode. These operations are controlled by an analog control signal supplied by the SP. The SP receives platform stabilization information (pitch / roll) from the navigation system over a data bus. The stabilization information is filtered, scaled, limited and converted to analog signals that are utilized by the A/P to control antenna elevation positioning. Elevation Tilt control of the Antenna is controlled via the SP. The original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the APS-143C (V) 3 Radar System is Telephonics Corporation (64694), 815 Broad Hollow Road, Farmingdale NY 11735. All components should be new with zero time and have FAA form 8130 with traceable to the OEM. Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options. Also, state approximate lead-time for acquiring your product. Please provide the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product. Please respond to the following questions: <br />(1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? <br />(8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POCs for civilian users for general usage of product questions. After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the USCG still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO).</p>
<p>Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the USCG to award any contract. Responses to this sources sought notice shall be e-mailed to Kia.R.Walton@uscg.mil. TELEPHONE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Responses must be received no later than March 22, 2011 at 4:00 PM EST. Firms responding to this announcement that fail to provide all of the required information cannot be used to help the USCG make the appropriate acquisition decisions which is the intent of this sources sought notice. This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.</p>

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Combat Support Equipment (CSE), Family of Field Medical Equipment (FFME), is seeking information regarding industry capabilities and best practices for Enterprise-wide, Tiered Distribution Support for Marine Corps Class VIII materiel (medical and dental supplies and equipment) in garrison.  Initial planning contemplates combining the USMCs expertise and knowledge of its medical needs/use with those of excellent supply chain operators for achieving optimum/best value results. Planning envisions using a performance-based set of requirements to describe goals, objectives, and constraints thus allowing experienced supply chain operators to determine how best to achieve those goals.
 

Class VIII materiel consists of Authorized Medical and Dental Allowance list (AMAL/ADAL) materiel, assembled into capability sets (assemblages). See Attachment 1 (AMAL Descriptions and NSNs). Equipment assemblages contain medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, and reusable materiel required to establish the basic function of the assemblage (e.g., an operating room, etc.). Supply assemblages contain consumable materiel to support the function in treating a designated number of casualties or to perform a specific task. Currently, Class VIII materiel is managed at multiple facilities that are locally controlled by Marine Corps Medical Logistics Companies (MEDLOGs).  

The current operating model is complex with numerous participants all with discrete span of control and influence.
 There are multiple parties responsible for execution of similar processes (e.g., Navy, Marines, 3PL provider, Theater Lead Agent Medical Materiel (TLAMM), etc.). There are significant opportunities to reduce costs, improve service levels, and limit inventory obsolescence. Attachment 2 (Current State & Contemplated Future 3PL Functions) sets forth current and notional future state operational models.

The future state operating model contemplates a Third Party Logistics Provider (3PL) who would conduct complete lifecycle management of the CLASS VIII garrison logistics chain. Overall objectives include promoting enhanced and sustained ready-to-issue posture of Class VIII materiel; reducing the garrison logistics burden on the operating forces; maintaining shelf-life standards and reduction of losses from expiry; providing enterprise-wide visibility and accountability; and reducing overall procurement, replenishment, and replacement costs.
  Major functions contemplated are demand management, supplier management, warehouse/inventory management/equipment preventative maintenance, invoicing, order management, transportation management, returns, and reporting.  

MCSC anticipates that this effort is a multiple year project. Further, MCSC may begin with a Concept Pilot to test the feasibility of the contemplated operating model. Upon the conclusion of the Pilot, the opportunity exists for an enterprise-wide implementation encompassing the whole of the Marine Corps Class VIII inventory. 


Request interested parties submit capabilities and experience descriptions, best practice information, and any information regarding commercial contractual arrangements.
 Capabilities may include any other relevant information.  Request interested parties provide the business information in Attachment 3 (Company Information).  An Industry Day for interested parties is tentatively planned for May 2011 at Camp Lejeune, NC.   The number of participants and attendees is limited and firms should indicate their interest in attending with their response to this RFI.  Interested firms will be notified of the date, time and other details of the Industry Day under separate cover, and will be required to provide a list of attendees.

Responses to this RFI are requested no later than 12 April 2011 to Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN: Mark Sanderson, CESS, CT023, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134.
 This information may also be submitted to mark.sanderson@usmc.mil. Submitted information will not be returned. All data received in response to this announcement marked, or designated, as corporate or proprietary information will be protected from release outside the Government in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act provisions. This RFI is for informational purposes only. This is not a request for proposal (RFP), invitation for bid (IFB), request for quotation (RFQ), or an announcement of a solicitation. No solicitation document exists. The submission of this information is for market research and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure these services, nor does the Marine Corps intend to award on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested.
 No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.

<p>The Systems 2020 Request for Information (RFI) HQ0034 stated that responders to the RFI may receive an invitation to a Systems 2020 Symposium, which was to be scheduled for March 2011 in the Washington DC area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In the interim, the topics related to Systems 2020 and a number of other DoD initiatives have been elevated to the level of a DoD-wide Science and Technology Priority area: Engineering of Resilient Systems. Due to this development, and the high quality of the RFI responses, the Government's needs for a Systems 2020 Symposium have changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Rather than selecting certain RFI responders to provide additional information in a symposium to help shape Systems 2020 planning for research and demonstration efforts, the more pressing need is to use the information already on hand to assist in developing consensus on technical gaps and opportunities among the DoD's Engineering of Resilient Systems stakeholders. This will affect DoD-wide research and development plans.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Consequently, the Systems 2020 Symposium will be replaced by a Government-only meeting, which is in the process of being scheduled. Respondents to the Systems 2020 RFI will receive notification of relevant industry days or other meetings that may follow this Government-only meeting.</p>

<DESC>DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS
<p>SUBJECT: Brand Name Procurement D260 7.6L International Engine)</p>
<p>FINDINGS</p>
<p>1. In accordance with (IAW) FAR 6.302-1(c), the use of such descriptions in the acquisition is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. Also, IAW IG5306 Air Force Contracting Guidelines, J&amp;A is not required for purchases under procedures in FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Dollar amount on requirement is not expected to exceed the SAT.</p>
<p>2. IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), the subject requirement of the agency is available as only one brand name and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. Written justification from the customer was received stating the reasons and characteristics of the desired product, International Engine D260 7.6L.</p>
<p>3. The requested brand name item is a replacement engine for a vehicle already in service. The engine is to replace original equipment installed by the manufacturer of the chassis. Engines of different specifications will not fit the vehicle manufacturer's design in the engine compartment. No other engine will be able to meet the need while maintaining original manufacturer design and functionality.</p>
<p>DETERMINATION</p>
<p>Based on the findings above, it is hereby determined that a brand name procurement for this requirement for the D260 7.6L International Engine is in the best interest of the Government and a sound business decision.</p>

<a href="mailto:dawn.montgomery@conus.army.mil">Fort Bliss DOC</a>
<DESC>Vendor Demonstration Opportunity<BR><BR>This Mission and Installation Contracting Command Fort Bliss is hosting a Mock-Training/Special Effects Industry Day on 30 -31 March 2011.  The intent for this event is to allow vendors to provide demonstrations or information on their products focused on training aids for live fire targetry concepts, battlefield effects, and training aids.  We anticipate holding an open forum discussion setting on Day 1 to discuss contracting strategies, industry standards, and the command vision.  This will be an opportunity for contractors and Army personnel to network and share ideas.  A representative from several installation offices will attend and give a presentation on the proposed vision and the business model for contracting.   <BR><BR>All suggestions are welcome to make this a worthwhile event for everyone.   All interested vendors/contractors are invited to RSVP their attendance as space will be limited for the event.  We may have future events for more specific topics of interest.<BR><BR>Day One - 30 March 2011<BR><BR>The first day will begin at approximately 9:00 AM with round table discussions followed by static displays that provide the visitor literature about the product and an opportunity for a "hands-on" experience. <BR> <BR>Day Two - 31 March 2011<BR><BR>The second day will consist of demonstrations of products that may require more space than the previous day's venue, scheduled by vendor for an audience of military and civilians.  The second day will be conducted on a range or area on East Fort Bliss that will allow for pyrotechnics and remotely operated devices to be used; it will not support live-fire demonstrations that would include projectiles or bullets to be used.  <BR><BR>The goal of the event is to develop best practices for future contract solicitations for the equipment, supplies, services listed in the following pages.  In these days of constricting budgets, Fort Bliss is looking for ways to provide cutting edge realistic training "Better, Faster, Cheaper, and Safer."  <BR><BR>TARGETS<BR>Fort Bliss is looking at options for remotely controlled mobile in two categories, man-size and vehicle-size.   They should both have locator systems that allow a user to locate the target among several structures even though out of line of sight.<BR>	The man size targets will be remotely controlled from up to one km away.  Both of these types should also be equipped to allow the operator to interact with the Soldiers executing the ranges.   <BR>		-The first type will be basically a mannequin target that can be moved by two or more wheels independent of some kind of track and across non-paved surfaces.  The target should be able to be engaged by up to 7.62mm rounds.  The movement system does have to be hardened against small arms as well.  The movement system should allow the target to negotiate three to four inch high obstacles, enter a ground level building or move across unpaved desert terrain.<BR>		-The second type of target should be stationary falling man targetry, mannequin-type targets linked to a mechanism that allows for the target to fall once it has been engaged.  The mechanism should have a varying sensitivity, the capability to be set to fall after being hit one to three times.  This mechanism should be unobtrusive, hidden within in the mannequin wearing a robe or other garment. <BR>	  The vehicular targets will be in at least two pieces, the movement system and the shell.  The movement system should be hardened to withstand up 7.62mm rounds.  It should have a top speed of at least 25 mph and be either diesel or electrically driven.  The system will be remotely controlled from up to one to two kilometers away.  It should have position location ability in order to allow the operator to ascertain its location in reference to the range upon which it is being operated.  The shell should be easily attached and unattached from the movement system by two personnel.  The shells should be available in a mix of configurations from civilian cars or trucks to commonly found military equipment.  <BR><BR>CASUALTY TRAINING AIDS<BR>Fort Bliss is looking for combat casualty training aids, something that more closely replicates combat wounds than the standard moulage kits.  These aids include live tissue replication and amputation.  These aids would allow Soldiers to wear wound-replicating attachments that would allow the responding personnel to do more than just evaluate the casualty.  The first responders should be able to begin to treat the casualty and see results.  More complex treatment apparatus would allow medically trained Soldiers to conduct evaluations on a living patient that replicates organ and soft tissue damage.  <BR><BR>TRAINING BUILDINGS<BR>Fort Bliss is also looking for temporary, easily transportable, and easily assembled training aids that replicate small buildings from Afghanistan, the Middle East, and rural Africa.  The exterior and interior should replicate the look and texture of various building materials like brick, cinder block, adobe, mud, wood, bamboo, straw, thatch, etc.  These aids may or may not have floors but must have roofs.  Ideally the training aids would be stackable and able to be palletized and designed for movement by truck or towed across rough terrain into locations.  These aids should be configurable or scalable in size and number to provide various size units varying experiences.  They must be easily assembled/disassembled by 2-4 persons using minimal hand tools, able to be procured in a mixture of buildings that resemble Afghanistan and Iraqi village structures, have (2) doors and (2) window openings, with each door being "breachable" and replaceable at low cost, have a hidden compartment for a weapons cache, made of long-lasting materials suitable for year-round military training, and include installation and training for first iteration of set up.<BR><BR>BREACHING DOORS/ WALL SECTIONS<BR>Fort Bliss is interested in training aids for breaching operations.  The overarching intent is to reduce repair time, time spent replacing training aids between iterations, and increase realism over current methods.  The feedback to the Soldier/user requires training aids that will give realistic feedback in resistance and operation to those found in theater.  The overall cost would be realized between saved man-hours and, over time, the replacement cost of alternative doors even though the initial dollar amount will be more than a hollow-core door.  <BR>The doors must be "scalable" to replicate doors of differing security levels, closed (latched), locked, and dead-bolted.  The doors and frames should be parts of the same system to alleviate any compatibility issues.  The doors should be breachable along the hinges or lock plate by pry, ram, shotgun (up to two-shot hinges and lock), hydraulic means, and/or explosives.  The doors will be reusable, not needing to be replaced, after being breached by explosives up to C2.  There may be different types of doors; a door may meet two of the five different types.  These doors will be able to open in either direction.<BR>The breachable wall sections should be a "plug" that can be used in an existing mud, brick, stone, or wooden wall that will allow Soldiers to explosively breach resulting in damage to that section only.  The rest of the wall will be undamaged and returning it to its "un-breached" appearance will be done by replacing the plug.  The plug can be produced in varying sizes, small squares or entire height-of-the-wall sections.<BR><BR>VISUAL MODIFICATIONS TO HMMWVS<BR>Fort Bliss is looking for easily applied and removed visual modification packages for M998 HMMWVs to replicate civilian cargo trucks of a type found in Afghanistan and in the Middle East in general.  Unlike the VISMODs used at the CTCs these would replicate civilian vehicles not OPFOR or Russian produce military equipment.  <BR>BATTLEFIELD EFFECTS <BR>Fort Bliss is looking for a way to replicate battlefield effects in regards to perceived threat without the dangers of producing casualties.  RPGs, mines, IEDs, VBIEDs, suicide vests, and artillery impact simulations are examples of the effects for which we are looking.  These effects will need to be able to be conducted in safely close proximity to Soldiers in day/night and all weather conditions.  They will provide an immersive environment in which Soldiers will be exposed to a level of realism that is not currently available.<BR>The solicitation would call for the contractor to provide subject matter experts and associated equipment and material to perform these effects as necessary for units' training for a period of 12 months with an option for an additional 12 months.  Following the 12 or 24 month period, GS Civilians will employ the equipment and utilize the original contractor's material for an additional 12 months, after which bidding would commence for long term contract for equipment and material.  During the contract period the SMEs will provide oversight to the training of GS Civilians in Range Operations to ensure they are able to safely produce those effects in accordance with applicable industry and state/federal laws, regulations, and standards.   The goal is to after using contractors for a limited time to ensure Range Operations personnel training, have Fort Bliss personnel able to create these effects safely. <BR>There is no fee for registration, however, it is limited by the venue capacity.  Once all seats are filled no further reservations will be accepted.  <BR><BR>Those firms interested in providing information in response to this sources sought are requested to provide the following information to the Contract Specialist, Dawn Montgomery at dawn.montgomery@conus.army.mil and Shellie Munoz at Shellie.munoz@us.army.mil by the close of business on 25 March 2011: <BR><BR>1) Firm Name; <BR>2) Firm Address; <BR>3) DUNS/CAGE Code; <BR>4) POC Information; <BR>5) Size of Business (number of employees); <BR>6) Annual Revenue; <BR>7) List the States you have performed work in; and <BR>8) Provide information on previous work performed for any of the topics to be discussed to include: a description of the project, POC name and phone number/email address for the owner, amount of contract award, period of performance of the contract, and other unique features of the project that we should know about.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS), in partnership with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRBB), a fiscal agent of the U.S. Treasury, is offering the Internet Payment Platform (IPP) service for use by Federal government agencies and their suppliers. The IPP is a new service provided by the FMS to assist DOI and its vendors in streamlining the order-to-pay process. <br />
<p>Beginning May 1, 2011, the Department of the Interior (DOI) will require the use of IPP for the electronic submittal of invoices and exchange of payment information to its suppliers of goods and services. The use of IPP for submittal of invoices is a mandatory requirement for all new contract awards dated on/after May 1, 2011 with the following DOI Bureaus: Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE), Office of Surface Mining (OSM), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS).</p>
<p>Beginning on/after October 1, 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the DOI Departmental Offices - including the National Business Center (NBC) will require the use of IPP for the electronic submittal of invoices. This notice will be updated as the use of IPP is mandated throughout the remaining DOI bureaus. The remaining bureaus include: Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), National Park Service (NPS), and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).</p>
<p>As a supplier to the DOI, the IPP is available through FMS at no cost to your company. The IPP enables vendors to create invoices directly from the contract award and submit invoices electronically to the DOI. The IPP also provides vendors on-line access to invoice status and payment information for all government payments; not only those invoiced via IPP, including offset and partial payments (replaces the PAID system). Please visit the IPP website at https://www.ipp.gov/ for questions on the program, contact information, demonstrations, registration video and seminar schedules that you may attend. For IPP enrollment questions, please contact the IPP Helpdesk (866-973-3131) or email IPPgroup@bos.frb.org for assistance. For DOI-specific questions regarding the mandatory use of IPP, please email the DOI IPP Team at FBMS_IPP@FBMS.DOI.GOV</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Photon Physics Group of the Electron and Optical Physics Division, Physics Measurement Laboratory, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Phytron, Inc., Williston, VT, for the purchase of four UHV Stepper Motors (two Phytron Models VSS 57.200.2.5-E-2M-VGPL 52/4-UHV-KTC; one Phytron Model VSS 33.200.1.2-2M-VGPL 32/25-VSS-KLC; and one Phytron Model VSS 43.200.1.2-E-2M-VGPL 42/100-VSS-KLC).
<p>Sole Source determination is based on the following: The four UHV stepper motors are replacement and expansion parts required to maintain the performance of NIST's EUV reflectometer. The reflectometer chamber is an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) apparatus with a complex multi-axis motion system based on UHV compatible stepper motors. This system must be UHV compatible in order to maintain cleanliness of the vacuum of the Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility (SURF III) to ensure cleanliness of customer's samples. The first and second motors are replacements for original motors within the system that have become unstable and have compromised the precision and accuracy of measurements made with the system. These two motors are required to make repairs and return the reflectometer to its original operating specifications. The third and fourth motors are for the expansion of capabilities for the reflectometer system. These two motors will be used in a high-torque application (max torque minimum: 1.1 Nm and 12 Nm) with tight space requirements (third motor minimum physical dimensions: motor + gear box body length &lt;80 mm; motor + gear box body dia. &lt;35 mm / fourth motor minimum physical dimensions: motor + gear box body length &lt;150 mm; motor + gear box body dia. &lt;45 mm) in a UHV environment.</p>
<p>Phytron, Inc., is the only vendor capable of providing the required UHV compatible stepper motors in order to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements. Phytron, Inc., is the sole manufacturer and distributor.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 335312, and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by March 23, 2011, 3:30 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to award, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Native Intelligence Inc. to revise and update a proprietary web-based safety training program.<br />&nbsp;
<p>A sources sought notice was posted to FedBizOpps on February 22, 2011 and closed on March 4, 2011. No viable responses were received.</p>

The web-based training includes 21 modules on Environmental Compliance Awareness, Risk Management, Accident Investigations, Driving Safety, Diving Safety, Small Boats Safety, Aviation Safety, Radiation Safety, and Sustainability.</p>
<p>The existing language, references and links, shall be updated with the current provided information. Appropriate graphics shall be updated to reflect the use of the NOAA safety mascot, "Safety Seagull." The sixty-three question quiz shall be updated in its entirety with new government-provided questions, one of which to be designed to use analytical assessment on the part of the user. All NOAA employees and contractors will be required to complete this on-line training program.</p>
<p>The revised program shall continue to be linked to the existing tracking system to ensure compliance by all NOAA employees and contractors, and reside on the Native Intelligence (NI) server.</p>
<p>Awarding to Native Intelligence Inc. meets the government's needs and is the most cost effective action. Awarding to different vendor would require extensive start up and development costs for a new web-based safety program.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of clause) <br />Alternate I (Oct 2008). When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i) and (l) for those in the basic clause. <br />(a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. <br />(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. <br />(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. <br />(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] <br />(5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may- <br />(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or <br />(B) Terminate this contract for cause. <br />(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. <br />(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to- <br />(i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or <br />(ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. <br />(7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. <br />(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. <br />(9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property. <br />(e) Definitions.

<p>(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor- <br />(1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or <br />(2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice. <br />(C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall- <br />(1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and <br />(2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract.</p>

If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert &lsquo;None'."] <br />(2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule.

(If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert &lsquo;None')."] <br />(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. <br />(3) Ceiling price.

When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. <br />(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): <br />(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; <br />(ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment- <br />(A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); <br />(B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures; <br />(C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and <br />(D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices. <br />(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost- <br />(A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and <br />(B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. <br />(5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor's payment will be made by check.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.)

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of clause) <br />Alternate I (Oct 2008).

(1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. <br />(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. <br />(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. <br />(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] <br />(5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may- <br />(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or <br />(B) Terminate this contract for cause. <br />(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. <br />(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to- <br />(i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or <br />(ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. <br />(7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. <br />(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. <br />(9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property. <br />(e) Definitions. (1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. As used in this clause- <br />(i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product or service. <br />(ii) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor category specified in the contract that are- <br />(A) Performed by the contractor; <br />(B) Performed by the subcontractors; or <br />(C) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control. <br />(iii) Materials means- <br />(A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control; <br />(B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract; <br />(C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer usage charges, etc.); <br />(D) The following subcontracts for services which are specifically excluded from the hourly rate: [Insert any subcontracts for services to be excluded from the hourly rates prescribed in the schedule.]; and <br />(E) Indirect costs specifically provided for in this clause. <br />(iv) Subcontract means any contract, as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1, entered into with a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of the prime contract or a subcontract including transfers between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor or subcontractor. It includes, but is not limited to, purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders. <br />(i) Payments. (1) Services accepted. Payment shall be made for services accepted by the Government that have been delivered to the delivery destination(s) set forth in this contract. The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer: <br />(i) Hourly rate. <br />(A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. <br />(B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. <br />(C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative. <br />(D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract. <br />(E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. <br />(1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated. <br />(2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. <br />(3) If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. <br />(ii) Materials. <br />(A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall be the contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the- <br />(1) Quantities being acquired; and <br />(2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.</p>
<p>(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor- <br />(1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or <br />(2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice. <br />(C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall- <br />(1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and <br />(2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract.</p>
<p>(D) Other Costs. Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed. <br />(1) Other Direct Costs. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert "None" if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert &lsquo;None'."] <br />(2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert "$0" if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert &lsquo;None')."] <br />(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. <br />(3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. <br />(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): <br />(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; <br />(ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment- <br />(A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); <br />(B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures; <br />(C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and <br />(D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices. <br />(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost- <br />(A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and <br />(B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. <br />(5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor's payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall- <br />(i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the- <br />(A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment); <br />(B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable; <br />(C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and <br />(D) Contractor point of contact. <br />(ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer. <br />(6)(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid. <br />(ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. <br />(iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if- <br />(A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner; <br />(B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or <br />(C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.607-2). <br />(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment. <br />(v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates: <br />(A) The date fixed under this contract. <br />(B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination. <br />(vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on- <br />(A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor; <br />(B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or <br />(C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor. <br />(vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract. <br />(viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the "completion invoice" and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion. <br />(7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions. <br />(i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor. <br />(ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. <br />(iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. <br />(8) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315. <br />(9) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. <br />(10) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. <br />(l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided. <br />52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.

<DESC>United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) located at MacDill Air Force Base (AFB), Florida, intends to award two individual sole source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The first contract will be awarded to Thales Communications Inc, 22605 Gateway Center Drive, Clarksburg, MD 20871. This contract will be for the repair and replacement of the AN/PRC-148 (V) 1/2 variants, referred to as the Multiband Inter/Intra Team Radio (MBITR) with the AN/PRC-148(V) 5/6, and referred to as the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Enhanced MBITR (JEM) SOF variants. The second will be awarded to Harris Corporation, 1680 University Ave, Rochester, NY 14610-1839 for the replacement of both the MBITR and AN/PSC-5D, referred to as the Multi-Band Multi-Mission Radio (MBMMR) with the Harris AN/PRC-152 SOF variants and the AN/PRC-117G, respectively. <br /><br />These contracts will support the five USSOCOM Component Commands and the six Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs) having common and/or SOF-unique mission requirements. In order to accommodate these mission requirements USSOCOM must establish contracts that will provide the required flexibility and capabilities to support such compelling requirements. In this regard, such an approach will establish a life cycle replacement (LCR) strategy for the total force and serve as an interim solution for the Next Generation Tactical Command Control Communications and Intelligence (NGTC3I) requirement. It includes the LCR of the MBITR radio with either the JEM or the AN/PRC-152 depending on mission/user requirements, e.g., embedded or external GPS.<br /><br />The JEM, is an upgraded version of the legacy MBITR that was first fielded in 2000. The JEM is a ruggedized software-defined hand held radio with embedded US Type I encryption. The JEM is interoperable with existing military and commercial radios that satisfy both current and future SOF C3 requirements. The AN/PRC-152 possesses the same capabilities as the JEM but with some additional features as found in the Next Generation Tactical Communication Capability (NGTCC) System, Capability Production Document (CPD).<br /><br />The JEM and the AN/PRC-152 are both technically acceptable handheld radios and are the only Non-developmental technical solutions available that are capable of meeting USSOCOM requirements as cited in the USSOCOM NGTC3I Market Investigation Report (MIR). The Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA) Integrated Waveform (IW) for UHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM), Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) E-SIP, and select Special Communications Modes (SCM) developed specifically for SOF. However, there are some subtle differences between the two radios that make them uniquely qualified for mutually exclusive SOF mission requirements. <br /><br />Operational experience and continued testing and evaluation of the JEM have proven that this radio is more adept at maritime missions and can be reconfigured while submerged. Moreover, the JEM allows for disabling the external USB connector when submerged but at the same time allows its control keys to remain fully operational. The AN/PRC-152's 10 Watt data burst capability provides increased data throughput when operating in its SATCOM mode. The AN/PRC-152 has an additional capability to be available in the coming months to provide a wireless mobile ad-hoc networking capability between the radios that offers broadband connectivity between team members within Line-of-sight of each other. Therefore, in order to meet all current mission requirements and align with the CIO's strategic plan for future material solutions HQ SOCOM must award contracts to support the LCR strategy that includes both technically acceptable replacement handheld radios for the MBITR. <br /><br />The AN/PRC-117G was also identified in the USSOCOM NGTC3I MIR, as the only manpack radio satisfying most of the CPD Key Performance Parameters (KPP), as well as several highly desirable objective requirements. The additional capabilities offered by this radio include its ability to provide a a proprietary mobile ad-hoc networking (MANET) capability, that is NSA Type I Certified . The AN/PRC-117G Advanced Networking Wideband Waveform (ANW2) MANET forms a wideband wireless network capable of supporting voice, data, and full motion video (FMV). It will also support a Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) interface providing the user with a data throughput of up to 500 kbps. <br /><br />The aforementioned radios are being purchased, fielded and sustained by the Government under existing contracts. These new IDIQ contracts will be used as a MBITR and MBMMR LCR that also includes sustainment of MBITR radios until they are replaced by the JEM and/or AN/PRC-152. Sustainment for both contracts shall include a contractor depot repair capability, field technical services, operator/maintainer training, and development, and test and installation of approved modifications and upgrades if required. <br /><br />USSOCOM is in the planning stages for a future competitive development effort providing a complete set of NGTC3I devices that include SOF-unique hand held and man-pack radios. In the interim, USSOCOM must continue its current contract relationships with both Thales Communications and the Harris Corporation. In light of current SOF operational commitments, schedule considerations, FYDP funding profiles, and the results of the aforementioned MIR USSOCOM has continued to enhance its current inventory of tactical radios in order to meet its dynamic mission requirements. Until complete replacement of the USSOCOM radio inventory with the objective NGTC3I devices continued sustainment of the legacy radios is required.<br /><br />In order to sustain the aforementioned radios USSOCOM would need to procure full technical data rights from both Thales and Harris assuming they would be agreeable to do so. This would be costly and any replacement radios would require NSA Certification, Naval Safety Certification (immersion), Aircraft Certification (30k feet ASL operation), JITC Interoperability and Standards Compliance Certifications, Safety Certifications (HERO, HERP, HERF) and Government conducted/witnessed Developmental and Operational testing. This is at least a 24-36 month effort to complete. All of these activities take place after the development/release of a full and open competitive solicitation (RFP). To do so, would cause substantial duplication of program costs, increased schedule risk and above all, result in unacceptable delays in meeting SOF mission requirements. Consequently, such additional costs and delays could not, at this time, be recovered through competition. <br /><br />The anticipated contract ceiling is a combined total (Harris + Thales) of $900M over a 5 year period for both efforts. These IDIQ contracts are anticipated to be awarded prior to Sept 2011 with a period of performance of 1 Oct 2011 - 30 Sep 2016. <br /><br />All responsible sources may submit a capability statement prior to the closing date of this announcement which shall be considered by the agency to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Deanna Cox, deanna.cox@socom.mil with a copy to Mr. Jon Katz, jonathan.katz@socom.mil, Mr. Mark Spadaro, mark.spadaro@socom.mil, and Mr. Valentin Torello, valentin.torello@socom.mil. All questions and/or communications shall be conducted by e-mail. All responses will be considered prior to making a final award determination.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

This clause takes precedence over any Government inspection and testing required in the contract's specifications, except for specialized inspections or tests specified to be performed solely by the Government.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of the Government's intent to award a firm-fixed price, commercial contract for the purchase of 5 ea Pre-Conditioned Air Hose Kits. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. All responsible sources may submit a response which, if timely received, must be considered by the agency.
<p>THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT RESULT IN AN ORDER AGAINST AN FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE. ANY OFFER WHICH IS PREDICATED UPON THE AWARD BEING PLACED AGAINST AN FSS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.</p>
<p><br />The purchase of 5 Pre-Conditioned Air Hose Kits, each kit consisting of the following: <br />Each kit of pre-conditioned hoses consist of 10 ea 25' LG hoses, 2 ea female connectors, 1 ea 90 degree elbows, 1 ea 45 degree elbows, 2 ea 10' long double "Y" hoses, w/ end caps, 1 ea 10' long triple "Y" hose w/ end caps, and 2 ea 10' long hoses 6" diameter, C-17 stenciled inside.<br />Mfr: PCA Hose Systems, Inc.<br />JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLE SOURCE:</p>
<p>PCA Hose Systems Inc in the only known source available that has an external patented hook and loop velcro, connection that's at least 6" wide to maintain a stronger grip with distinctive features of a flat hose with edge bindings that keeps the hose from twisting, makes it easier to store, reduce scuffing, increase longevity, prevent damage to aircraft and will not be damaged if driven over. Three part construction of the hoses consist of the outer layer which is an oil resistant, waterproof, 18/20 ounce vinyl coated, 1000 denier polyester fabric. The second layer is open-cell foam and the bottom layer is 420 Denier Nylon coated fabric which is used on air bags, and not by any other hose company. This material prevents aircraft damage caused by flaking and cracking of the inner line and could possible cause health issues. All hoses and connections are independently pressure tested to 50' in water for 5 minutes. Other companies such as AMcraft and J&amp;B Aviation do carry flat hoses but don't have the same type hook and loop connections, thickness of materials and are more time consuming to install. Some are equipped with zipper connections which create extra work to replacements when broken or corroded, and won't maintain a solid air tight grip due to zipper connections. Also PCA Hose Systems are currently used by the F-15 and C-5 squadrons and we need our hoses to match up with there's for conformity. There are times when we will need to trade hoses between each other and they need to be the same in order to connect correctly to the AC units. We will have repair kits for this brand of hoses and they need to be able to work between all squadrons for repair capability.</p>
<p>Only quotes for new, unused equipment will be considered.</p>
<p>Price(s) should be FOB Destination (Robins AFB GA 31098). In addition to price and delivery, quote should include your cage code, DUNS number, and taxpayer ID number. Requested delivery date is 30 days ARO or earlier.</p>
<p>Quotations should be emailed to SSgt James E. Kaari (james.kaari@robins.af.mil) no later than Monday,&nbsp;14 March 2011, 4:00 pm EST.</p>
<p>The following clauses are applicable to subject solicitation (current through FAC 2005-49 dated 24 Jan 2011, and DFARS Change Notice 20110120):<br /><br />FAR 52.211-6 Brand-Name or Equal<br />FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors<br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items<br />FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items<br />FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items<br />FAR 52-212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, and DFARS 252.212-7001<br />FAR 52.247-34 FOB Destination<br />DFARS 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation (Appl if unit price exceeds $5K.)<br />DFARS 252.232.7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (WAWF is the method used by DoD for processing invoices/receiving reports.)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is issued as a Request for Proposal.  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) of the US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command proposes to procure a state of the art gunfire system to conduct testing for helicopter vulnerability reduction testing.  The gunfire system must be mountable on a pan and tilt type base and be capable of remote triggering.  The system must have multiple barrels to allow different calibers to be tested with one receiver mechanism and be forklift transportable.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 05-48.  The gunfire system will include two receiver assemblies, one receiver base and interchangeable barrels (see table 1).  <BR>The receiver must serve as a breech/chamber mechanism for multiple calibers, and be able to change and secure barrels for cartridges ranging from 5.45mm to 12.7mm and optionally 14.5mm.  Since the gun system is remotely triggered through a custom solenoid mechanism, the UR assembly shall fire the projectiles through a solenoid adaptable type striker arrangement and be capable of withstanding the maximum proof testing pressures for all specified calibers.  The UR must be finished in a manner to withstand outdoor weather conditions, including humidity and light rain. <BR>The universal receiver (UR) base assembly must be able to hold the universal base and selected barrel assembly securely during the firing process and must be capable of mounting weights to allow for stable operation of the gun system through the range of calibers.  A recoil absorption feature shall be incorporated to minimize the shot-to-shot movement of the base.  The base must be able to pan and tilt the gun system and be readily moveable.  The base must be finished in a manner to withstand outdoor weather conditions, including humidity and light rain.<BR>Two types of barrels are specified:  Rifled velocity barrels and smoothbore projectile tumbling barrels.  All barrels are to be manufactured using steel suitable for high quality rifle barrels and should be finished in a manner to withstand outdoor weather conditions, including humidity and light rain.  The tumble type barrels are to be smoothbore with a 60 degree vertical slant milled through the bore centerline on the muzzle end of the barrel for all 5.45, 5.56 and 7.62 cartridges.  Twelve point 7mm and 14.5mm tumble barrels are to have a 30 degree slant milled in, similar to the smaller cartridges.  All barrels must fit the universal receiver and have a key as to align the barrels in a manner to ensure the tumble slant is vertical.  A single firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.  Delivery is intended for the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, Fort Eustis, Virginia within 5 months of contract award.  Shipping, crating and estimated delivery time shall be clearly stated in the proposal.  Inspection/Acceptance is Aviation Applied Technology Directorate Bldg 401 Lee Blvd., Fort Eustis, VA  23604.  This procurement will be solicited, evaluated, and awarded using FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Services procedures.  This requirement is under NAICS code 336411.  Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to this procurement described are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability by responding to this requirement and submitting a quote.  Existing product literature generally available in industry should be submitted with your quote.  All responsible sources that submit an offer will be considered.  <BR>It is the intent to award to the contractor that provides the technically acceptable, lowest priced gunfire system.  A solicitation document is not available.  Proposals are due March 14 2011, 2:00 PM, E.S.T.  Submit inquiries regarding this procurement to the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate.

<p>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) requires the services of a company to provide courses to teach IRP researchers how to generate, maintain, and differentiate human iPS cells into a variety of lineages.</p>
<p>Background Information:<br />The NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine (NCRM) is seeking a company to provide courses to teach IRP researchers how to generate, maintain, and differentiate human iPS cells into a variety of lineages. NCRM is seeking a company with proven experience in stem cell technology and expertise in their differentiation to specific cell types such as neural, ocular or cardiac cells, and in providing effective training courses to beginning and advanced iPS researchers that contribute to successful hiPS cell generation and differentiation.</p>
<p>Objectives:<br />The objective of this task is to provide training in generating, maintaining, and differentiating human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPS) cell lines. Instructors will provide "state of the art" information on differentiating hiPS cells into embryoid bodies and various differentiated cell types such as neural, ocular or cardiac cells.</p>

The FAES facility fee is approximately $2,000 per day not including sustenance for the attendees. FAES can supply a list of potential vendors that could supply a sustenance package for the attendees.</p>
<p>The training will take place at the following location:</p>

<p>Evaluation:<br />Cost/price is a selection factor. All evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost/price, but not to the exclusion of consideration of cost or price. The closer offerors are determined to be in technical merit, the greater the importance of cost or price in making an award. If offerors' proposals are evaluated as technically comparable, then cost/price will become an important consideration. A best value determination will be made.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria:<br />The Government intends to evaluate proposals and establish one contract without discussions. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.

<p><br />BPA to Obtain Temporary Services of Subject Matter Experts and other Support for FNS Research and Evaluation Initiatives<br />Part I: General Information</p>

FNS anticipates that the duration of the BPA will be 2 years with 3 options to extend duration an additional 1 year each (total of 5 years if all options exercised). The duration of each Task Order will be specified in the Task Order.<br />Task Orders will relate to specific assignments for one or more subject matter experts (SMEs).

Some Task Order assignments (such as those related to procurement) will require that the selected experts be free from prior, current or anticipated conflicts of interest and avoid conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts of interest, as required by law and regulations of individuals involved in Federal procurement decisions.<br />&bull;May vary in start time. Some Task Orders assignments may need to have an expert start work within a few days; others may have longer lead times.<br />Overview of BPA Responsibilities<br />1.The contractor shall identify and recruit SMEs screened for professional reputation (overall quality of expertise), independence from contract research firms typically funded by FNS and from advocacy groups that regularly comment on FNS programs and policies.</p>

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR DESIGN EXCELLENCE FOR DESIGN-BUILD FOR THE RENOVATION OF BYRON G. ROGERS FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, DENVER, COLORADO. PROJECT: RECOVERY. GSA Design Excellence Solicitation for Design-Build Modernization of the Byron G. Rogers Federal Office Building, Denver, Colorado. GSA will be using funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for this project. BUILDING TYPE: Federal Office Building CLIENT AGENCY: General Services Administration - Region 8 Offices SIZE: 494,156 gsf PARKING SPACES: 168 BUDGET: Estimated Construction Cost is between $100,000,000 and $125,000,000 GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Integrated Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. This high performance green building project will continue the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation through the preservation and modernization of a historic federal building. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program commissions our nation&rsquo;s most talented architects, engineers, landscape architects, and interior designers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 &ndash; 100 years of service. GSA Design Excellence projects demonstrate the merit of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs, aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give public expression to our democratic values. As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA&rsquo;s P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). All GSA projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific credits required. Projects in or affecting historic properties must comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Secretary of the Interior&rsquo;s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. This facility must be designed in metric units. This project will be delivered through the Design-Build delivery method. PROJECT DESCRIPTION The project consists of a major modernization upgrade project for the Byron G. Rogers Federal Office Building (FB) and a window replacement project for the adjacent Byron G. Rogers U.S. Courthouse. This work is performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The FB occupies a prominent position in the Federal District of downtown Denver. It is an existing multi-tenant professional office building with 18 stories and a basement. The FB contains 494,156 gross square feet (GSF), 437,551 rentable square feet (RSF), and 329,433 usable square feet (USF). The current FB tenants will be relocated prior to the start of the modernization project. Agencies to be located in the federal building will be the Commission on Civil Rights, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, Social Security Administration, and the General Services Administration. The courthouse is a multi-tenant office and court building. It is five stories high with a basement and subbasement connected to the FB by a two story section. This section contains building services, a loading dock, and a two lane ramp to the parking garage. The courthouse houses six major tenants including United States District Court, Court Administrative Support Center, Probation and Pre-Trial Services, U.S. 10th Circuit Library, 10th Circuit Mediation and the United States Marshals Service. The building is approximately 248,000 GSF including two levels of underground parking spaces within the basement and sub-basement. A comprehensive modernization project for the courthouse was completed in 2005. The courthouse will remain occupied while the windows are replaced. The federal building and courthouse are located at 1961 Stout Street, Denver, Colorado, 80294. Both buildings are long-term GSA-held assets situated in a prime location near downtown with public transportation within the central business district, in the Federal District of downtown Denver, with a stable tenant base and a high reinvestment need. Project goals and objectives for the federal building are to provide a pleasant, secure, and safe environment for the staff and visitors consistent with guidelines for Federal facilities and specifically the GSA PBS P-100; satisfy current and projected special-use needs, and allow for future expansion of these requirements; design facilities compatible with the tenants&rsquo; existing character and local context, and present a positive image of U.S. Government facilities; use the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, which is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance green buildings.

<p>This high performance green building project will continue the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation through the preservation and modernization of a historic federal building. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program commissions our nation's most talented architects, engineers, landscape architects, and interior designers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 - 100 years of service. GSA Design Excellence projects demonstrate the merit of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs, aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give public expression to our democratic values.</p>
<p>As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS).

This facility must be designed in metric units.</p>
<p>The design and construction of this project will be delivered through the Design-Build delivery method under separate contract.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The project consists of a major modernization upgrade project for the Byron G. Rogers Federal Office Building (FB) and a window replacement project for the adjacent Byron G. Rogers U.S. Courthouse. This work is performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The FB occupies a prominent position in the Federal District of downtown Denver. It is an existing multi-tenant professional office building with 18 stories and a basement. The FB contains 494,156 gross square feet (GSF), 437,551 rentable square feet (RSF), and 329,433 usable square feet (USF). The current FB tenants will be relocated prior to the start of the modernization project. Agencies to be located in the federal building will be the Commission on Civil Rights, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, Social Security Administration, and the General Services Administration.<br />The courthouse is a multi-tenant office and court building. It is five stories high with a basement and subbasement connected to the FB by a two story section. This section contains building services, a loading dock, and a two lane ramp to the parking garage. The courthouse houses six major tenants including United States District Court, Court Administrative Support Center, Probation and Pre-Trial Services, U.S. 10th Circuit Library, 10th Circuit Mediation and the United States Marshals Service. The building is approximately 248,000 GSF including two levels of underground parking spaces within the basement and sub-basement. A comprehensive modernization project for the courthouse was completed in 2005. The courthouse will remain occupied while the windows are replaced. The federal building and courthouse are located at 1961 Stout Street, Denver, Colorado, 80294. Both buildings are long-term GSA-held assets situated in a prime location near downtown with public transportation within the central business district, in the Federal District of downtown Denver, with a stable tenant base and a high reinvestment need.</p>
<p>Project goals and objectives for the federal building are to provide a pleasant, secure, and safe environment for the staff and visitors consistent with guidelines for Federal facilities and specifically the GSA PBS P-100; satisfy current and projected special-use needs, and allow for future expansion of these requirements; design facilities compatible with the tenants' existing character and local context, and present a positive image of U.S. Government facilities; use the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, which is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance green buildings. GSA requires all new construction, renovation, and modernization projects to be certified through the LEED program; owing to the historic significance of the building, all work will follow the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Illustrated Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, Revised 1992 (36 CFR 67); upgrade the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; upgrade the mechanical piping, heating, and hot water systems; upgrade the electrical system and install new telecommunications infrastructure; modernize all elevators; remove all asbestos containing materials (ACMs); implement GSA's workplace procedures and achieve measurable effectiveness results; identify design strategies that work to optimize the project's access to energy from seasonal solar, natural lighting, and wind to reduce undesirable loads and maximize desirable loads to meet desired energy targets for the facility; upgrade by replacing all public and private restrooms, plumbing systems, and fixtures; upgrade building security; replace underground water and waste water service lines.</p>

<p>PROCUREMENT STRATEGY</p>
<p>The General Services Administration intends to award a firm-fixed price Contract based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)&nbsp;Subpart 36.3, Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include phase-two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 36.303. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require contractor interviews/presentations at the Denver Federal Center, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>

<DESC>John Day Dam is pursuing the purchase to replace 230 high bay lighting fixtures in the John Day Dam Powerhouse. The existing fixtures are failing, provide poor light spectrum and elevated noise levels in the powerhouse. <br /><br />The power requirements for the John Day Dam high bay fixtures are as follows: <br />Transformers are 4160 to 480 delta-delta with 480 volts 3 phase to each supply breaker. One 480 vac leg is dropped of at each fixture to reflect 480 vac single phase at each fixture. This in turn distributes the load throughout the system. <br /><br />This power requirement is not typical to industry standards. The performance results of the new light fixtures to be procured shall improve the powerhouse lighting to a more natural light, the noise level shall be reduced (as electronic ballasts produce no noise) and an increased longevity in the lamps or ballasts. <br /><br />John Day Dam has procured this once before, and at that time, only one known source could meet the unique power requirements. The part number was D400ALHB16480 with Metro Light. <br /><br />If you're interested in providing a quote for this NON-TYPICAL power requirement high bay light fixture acquisition, please contact Kathryn Newhouse via email at Kathryn.A.Newhouse@usace.army.mil with your company's name, DUNS number, point of contact, and phone number as well as an explanation of the product that you would be providing to meet this need and it's power requirement details. This acquisition is anticipated to be a full and open, unrestricted acquisition. <br /><br />The FSC code is 5975  and the NAICS code is 423610.

<DESC>Sunny Point Fire and Emergency Services Department currently uses Tomar lighting products on its fleet of emergency vehicles. Over 60% of the current fleet has Tomar light bars installed.  The remainder of the fleet is the current requirement.  Tomar All current on-hand replacement parts are for use in Tomar products. Ordering any other manufacturers lightbars would require another set of replacement parts to be purchased at an additional cost to the Government. Additionally, Tomar products offer interchangeability capabilities between their products that would be lost with the introduction of another manufacturer's product. These interchangeability capabilities allow equipment to be moved or reconfigured as needed, reducing equipment downtime that would normally be associated with reconfiguring operations or with procuring repair parts. Tomar's modular design is proprietary and no other manufacturers offer like items that would be compatible with the Tomar design. These products will provide a seamless fit into current Sunny Point Fire and Emergency Services Department on-hand equipment enabling the Department to continue to meet its mission in a safe and efficient manner.<br><br>

<p>Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>1. This document constitutes justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the acquisition described herein, under the authority of FAR 6.302-2. It is executed on behalf of Eastern Air Defense Sector.</p>
<p>2. The 174 FW proposes to procure by means of other than full and open competition Emergency Replacement of EADS 750 KVA Transformer.</p>
<p>3. The Service is at a cost of $75,000.00.<br /><br />4. Identification of statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>

<p>b. 15 USC 637</p>
<p>5. Demonstrate that the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.</p>
<p>This procurement is for the replacement of a 750KVA Transformer at the Eastern Air Defense Sector. On 21 January 2011 we received a call from EADS saying that they were having issues with their power system, the existing transformer had blown and all 6 of the 600AMP fuses that provide power to their building had blown. TSgt Holmes authorized EADS to have HMT Inc. respond and asses the situation. HMT Inc. has the most familiarity with EADS Transformers and power systems. HMT Inc. has provided excellent immediate response time in the past for EADS issues and holds the necessary technical expertise to accomplish this replacement in the stringent timeline provided. All prices are deemed fair and reasonable current wage determinations were used and the Governments Independent Government Estimate has been compared.</p>
