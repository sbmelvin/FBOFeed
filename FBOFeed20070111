<DESC>The Navy intends to procure on a sole source basis, forty (40) each fifteen (15)  meter Antenna Masts Part Number BSM2-M-M215-JBS-000 from Bluesky Mast, Inc. 1202 W North B St.  Tampa, FL 33606, to support currently deployed 500-foot sloping V long wire antennas.  The antenna masts are required to provide  continuous-uninterrupted communication capabilities by securing various antennas which transmit and receive signals.  It has been determined that only the above described Bluesky antenna mast meets all of the Governments requirements and avoids duplication of logistical related costs related to designing new cases and drawings, re-create user documentation, revise training packages, and managing and maintaining associated inventories for more than one equipment type.  The masts need to be flexible and strong enough to support the AS-2259, COM-201, DC-80 and DC-190 antennas.  The mast system must include; aluminum/stainless steel/Delrin Tripod, winch, cable for winch, mast adapters to affix all of the antennas and Honeywell Guys Spectra 1000.  The mast must be be lightweight (tripod, mast sections, and all accessories comprising the  mast must weigh no more than 70 pounds and must be one person deployable and 1 person portable) be delivered in a durable rollaway bag making for easy transportation and storage.  It must be flexible enough to bend without breaking, thus preventing a catastrophic failure, even in extreme conditions.  In situations when useable deployment area is limited, such as wooded areas or mountainous terrain, the mast must be capable of deploying, per mast, up to 4 antennas (up to 50 pounds) on a winching assembly. Due to the broad range of deployable theaters of operation, the mast must be impervious to sandy and salt/fog conditions and therefore require sealed mechanisms and 100% corrosion free components.  No telephone responses will be accepted.

<DESC>NATO Supreme Allied Commander Transformation Headquarters (HQ SACT) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Military Budget Committee (MBC). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the provision of contractor support for the development of the conceptual framework necessary to plan, establish, organize, and operate an effective NATO military training facility at the Joint Force Training Center (JFTC) in Bydgoszcz, Poland, including the internal preparatory training for the center staff. This support includes an on-site project manager to provide expertise and manage the planning, coordination and integration of all related sub-projects and individual tasks.

HQ SACT is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the MBC. HQ SACT intends to use the two envelope, sealed bid procedure. Partial bidding is not authorized.

The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference for this project is ACT-JFTC-07-04 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using as its reference IFIB-ACT-JFTC-07-04.

Companies from NATO nations that have performed similar contracts within the last five years substantially similar in scope to the requirement described in the solicitation are eligible to apply. 

Contractor personnel performing services under the contract must be citizens of a NATO nation and possess a NATO SECRET level security clearance; have a university or advanced business school degree or equivalent, reflecting project management skills; and have as a minimum five years experience in a NATO military environment.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

JFTC provides training to forces up to the Component Commanders level for joint and combined operations over the full spectrum of Alliance operations. To conduct this training, JFTC must set up, operate and maintain a new training facility for Computer Assisted Exercises (CAX) with up to 400 participants. In addition, once fully operational, JFTC will serve as the focal point and center of expertise for NATO joint operations and warfare at the tactical level. This includes, but is not limited to, the integration of new concepts into training programs, the incorporation of interoperability and standardization aspects into tactical level training, the support of the Joint Collective Experimentation Program, and the support of doctrine development. 

Currently operating from its temporary office building and therefore depending on external training facilities and support, JFTC is providing limited training and exercise support with focus on training in preparation for real world mission (e.g., ISAF Regional Command Training).

The purpose of the transition process is to enable JFTC to exploit, prepare and execute the potential of the new state-of-the-art facility. The transition process itself will be accomplished through the execution and implementation of the following three major projects:

- JFTC Infrastructure Project
- JFTC Output Concept Project
- JFTC Transitional Training Project

These projects are interdependent and, in particular, the Transition Training must be based on results produced by the other two projects. While JFTC can provide the necessary management for the Infrastructure Project, which is already in progress under primary Host Nation responsibility, JFTC has neither the expertise nor the resources necessary to perform the project management as well as develop the conceptual framework deemed necessary to exploit the capabilities of the new facility. In order to establish this conceptual framework, JFTC has identified the need to draw on contractor support to provide the necessary experience, expertise, and project management. 
 
BIDDING PROCEDURE

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Those firms that are nominated to the bidders list before the deadline will receive e-mail notification that the IFIB documents have become available for downloading from the following website: 

http://www.act.nato.int/contracting.asp?contracttype=RFP

As provided for under MBC rules, nominations to the bidders list will continue to be accepted by the Host Nation after the IFIB is issued and until the bid closing date.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Earliest date that IFIB will be posted on website: 11 January 2007

3. Planned bid closing date: 22 February 2007

4. Period of Performance: Calendar year 2007 with one additional option year

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to modify Contract N00024-06-C-6353 with BAE Systems, Information and Electronic Systems Integration (IESI) of 65 Spit Brook Road, P.O. Box 868, Nashua, NH 0306I to add hours for engineering support services for the Quick Reaction Dismounted (QRD) JCREW Production contract. This effort will enhance the operating functionality of these Dismounted CREW systems, and is essential to ensuring that these systems protect U.S. personnel from the threat posed by Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Engineering support services are required for analysis, design and tradeoff studies for modifications that will increase system effectiveness or ease the use; for threat loadset and software improvements to enable the system to address new and emerging threats; and for on-going effectiveness, interoperability, communication compatibility, changing threat level, and radiation hazard testing for the QRD systems.  BAE Systems, Information a!  nd Electronic Systems Integration is the current producer of the Dismounted CREW systems, and the only contractor that possesses the requisite knowledge and experience on this Dismounted JCREW system to meet the Governments requirement. Thus, BAE is the only reasonable source available that can satisfy JCREW Program requirements in accordance with the requirements outlined in Contract N00024-06-C-6353. The period of performance is for approximately one (1) year for engineering support services, with work ending in February 2008. Contract modification will be awarded pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (c)(1). Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact BAE Systems, Information and Electronic Systems Integration (IESI) directly. See Numbered Note 22*****

<DESC>Description 

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) requires logistical, technical, and administrative support to maintain, coordinate, and manage a multi-site network of clinical centers conduct?ing research on treatment, prevention, diagnosis, epidemiology, and natural history of HIV infection and disease in pediatric, adolescent, and maternal patient populations, including both domestic and international clinical sites. The NICHD is announcing a competitive Request for Proposal for a Contractor to serve as the NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and maternal HIV Clinical Studies Coordinating Center, which encompasses both clinical trials on the treatment and management of HIV infection in infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant and non-pregnant women domestically and internationally, including infrastructure development as well as clinical trials. The Coordinating Center contract currently encompasses several inter-related projects: the NICHD Network of clinical trials sites; the Latin American/Caribbean NICHD International Site Development Initiative (NISDI); a trial of post-exposure prophylaxis of HIV-exposed infants (NICHD/HPTN 040 Trial); the India Perinatal Project; and site monitoring for phase III investigator-initiated clinical trials. The current contractor for this effort is Westat, Inc.

Scope of activities:

Current activities conducted within the Coordinating Center contract include the following:

	NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Trials Network

The NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Clinical Trials Network (NICHD Network) has been funded through the NICHD Coordinating Center contract since 1987.  The NICHD Network consists of domestic and international clinical sites that enroll study subjects in trials related to preventing and treating HIV infection and its complications in neonates, infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women, as well as selected clinical trials of gender-specific manifestations of HIV infection in non-pregnant women.  The Network enrolls into trials conducted by the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) and Adult ACTG funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  the NICHD-funded Adolescent HIV Medicine Trials Network (ATN), and Pediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA). Domestically, the Network consists of 20 centers, located in 18 cities, in 10 states/territories (including Puerto Rico); there are six international clinical trials sites: five sites in different areas of Brazil, and one in the Bahamas.    NICHD also supports laboratory-based pathogenesis-oriented research in the context of clinical trials.  The Coordinating Center provides support to clinical trials site investigators with special laboratory expertise for the conduct of specialized pathogenesis-based studies in the context of PACTG protocols.  The Coordinating Center provides special support to international sites, such as providing specimen transport through a central Coordinating Center contract with World Courier.  

	Latin American/Caribbean NICHD International Site Development Initiative 

Through the experience of the NICHD Network with directly opening antiretroviral drug treatment trials in sites in Brazil and Bahamas in 1998 and 1999, NICHD identified a need for further training and development to increase Latin American and Caribbean capacity for the conduct of clinical trials, particularly those involving experimental drugs.  During 2000, NICHD and Coordinating Center began the NICHD International Site Development Initiative in Latin America and the Caribbean (NISDI) to address this need.  NISDI is designed to provide capacity-building and training to international sites through the conduct of two observational studies: one in HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants; and the other in HIV-exposed, but uninfected infants and HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents. The goal of this initiative is to train investigators and develop sites that will be able to participate in future international prevention and treatment trials. The Coordinating Center currently subcontracts with 25 sites in six countries participating in the protocols from Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Bahamas, Jamaica and Peru.  As of July 2006 there were 1,136 pregnant women and 1,522 pediatric patients enrolled into their respective protocols.  

	Clinical Trial of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis of HIV-Exposed Infants in Latin America and the U.S.

NICHD, through the Coordinating Center contract, is conducting a study to evaluate the efficacy of antiretroviral prophylaxis provided only to the infant in situations in which the mother has not received any antiretroviral therapy prior to delivery.  This includes women who are first identified as HIV-infected during labor, and therefore are unable to receive antepartum or intrapartum prophylaxis. This study compares three different types of post-exposure prophylaxis in such infants  standard zidovudine for six weeks to the infant (standard in Brazil and U.S.); a combination of zidovudine with nevirapine; and a triple combination of zidovudine, nevirapine and nelfinavir.  The Coordinating Center is responsible for all aspects of clinical trials management, including protocol and forms design, drug repository and dispensation, regulatory issues, data management and data analysis.  Participating sites include 6 sites in the US, 8 sites in Brazil, 1 site in Argentina, and 1 site in South Africa in Johannesburg with a second site in Cape Town about to open.  

	India Perinatal Initiative 

Collaboration with investigators in southern India on a perinatal HIV prevention project was initiated in late 2000, entitled "An observational study of the seroprevalence of, and interventions to decrease the risk of maternal to child transmission of HIV in Tamil Nadu, India".  During Stage I of the study, all pregnant women registered in the antenatal clinics were offered the opportunity to participate in an educational session about HIV infection and transmission. Pre- and post-session assessments of knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs were administered to a random sample of women.  Voluntary counseling and HIV testing were offered to all women, and the seroprevalence rated was estimated.  Enrollment into this part of the protocol took place between December 2003 and December 2004.   During Stage II, those women identified as HIV-infected were offered enrollment in a prospective cohort study and offered antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent mother to child transmission (initially zidovudine, then zidovudine plus single-dose nevirapine).  Enrollment into this part of the protocol began in early 2004, and the final subject study visits were completed in May 2006.    It is anticipated that close-out of sites, analyses and laboratory testing of stored samples from this study will continue into the new Coordinating Center project period.

	Site Monitoring of Phase III NICHD-Funded Investigator Initiated International trials

As the NICHD international research grant portfolio has increased to include large phase III clinical trials conducted in resource-limited countries, there is an increasing need to ensure that such investigator-initiated trials are conducted ethically, in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, and with attention to human subject safety.  The Coordinating Center will conduct site monitoring for selected NICHD grantees conducting large clinical trials to ensure appropriate trial conduct.  The Coordinating Center is currently performing site monitoring for the NICHD-funded NEVEREST (Nevirapine Resistance Study) trial evaluating response to therapy in women and children exposed to single-dose nevirapine for prevention of mother to child transmission being conducted in South Africa.   


It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded, for a period of performance of 5 years, beginning approximately November 1, 2007.  RFP-NIH-NICHD  CRMC-2008-01 will be available electronically on or about January 29, 2007, with a closing date tentatively set for April 11, 2007  and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps or through the NICHD website at http://www.nichd.nih.gov/funding/grantcontract/, Research and Development Contracts, Contract Opportunities ? Federal Business Opportunities. Offerors are responsible for routinely checking this Web site for any amendments to the solicitation.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>On or about March 15, 2007, NASA will issue instructions to Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corporation, Boulder, Colorado, ITT Industries Space Systems LLC, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, Palo Alto, California, for Phase 2 (Implementation) of the Geostationary Lightning Mapper instrument for GOES.  These companies were awarded contracts for Phase 1 (Formulation) under the progressive competition procedures described in NASA FAR Supplement 1817.7300 (c) and 1817,7301-5.  While NASA's expectation is that only these Phase 1 contractors will be able to successfully compete for Phase 2, all proposals will be considered.  However, a proposal from any such additional offeror(s) must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the Phase 1 contractors.  This demontration must include completion of a Concept Design and the results of completed trade studies, analyses, and demonstrations (fully compliant with Phase 1 Contract Statement of Work).  Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render a proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.  All of these conditions were disclosed during the full and open competition for Phase 1.  Prior to the release of the instuctions to the Phase 1 contractors, certain preliminary documents will be provided for their comment.  Any responsible source may indicate its desire to submit a proposal for the implementation phase.  These documents and the final instructions to the Phase 1 contractors will be available to potential additional offerors upon request.  Requests for the preliminary documents or for the final instructions to the Phase 1 contractors must be directed to Donna Santos, Code 210.7, NASA/GSFC, Greenbelt, MD 20771.

<DESC>The 2006 Quadrennial Report identifies two fundamental requirements for our nation to successfully engage the Long War: The ability to be agile and quick to adapt to chaotic, dynamic and asymmetric challenges and the alignment of DoD structures, processes and procedures to effectively support strategic direction. The Human Performance, Training & Education (HPT&E) program seeks to address this first requirement by enhancing the combat capability of the world's pre-eminent, fighting force - the U.S. Marine Corps. HPT&E is motivated by the Naval Research Advisory Committee's (NRAC) Distributed Operations (DO) Summer Study's recommendation to the Assistant Secretary of Navy (RD&A) and the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Commandant to direct the Chief of Naval Research (CNR) to establish a "DO Marine as a System" Science and Technology (S&T) program. The envisioned program is also responsive to NRAC's determination that training and education could be a significant obstacle for Distributed Operations.  HPT&E addresses these high level requirements through a range of focused Research and Development (S&T) Pillars and scientific anchor points.  For questions regarding this solicitation, please contact Ms. Tia Belton at 703-696-0942 or e-mail: tia_belton@onr.navy.mil.

<DESC>The goal of electronic warfare is to control the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum by exploiting, disrupting, or denying enemy use of the spectrum while ensuring its use by friendly forces. To that end, ONR's Electronic Warfare Discovery and Invention (D&I) program invests in science and technology (S&T) initiatives that will provide naval forces (including Navy and Marine Corps) with improved threat warning systems, electronic support measures (ESM), decoys, and electronic attack (EA) countermeasures as well as communication and navigation countermeasures. 

ONR 312 Electronic Warfare (EW) seeks white papers for efforts that shall develop and demonstrate technologies for the next generation components and systems in Electronic Warfare. White papers should address technology developments in one or more of the following areas.

6.1	Extending the EW Spectrum
The objective is to increase Naval (Navy and Marine Corps) dominance of the EW spectrum by extending our capabilities beyond the traditional radio frequency (RF) radar (1-18 GHz) and electro-optical / infrared (EO/IR) (0.1 - 5 microns) bands. Potential hostile use of the extended spectrum will require both signal detection and exploitation technologies (ESM) and spectral attack and denial technologies (EA). Potential spectral extensions include:
a.	Low band RF (HF/VHF/UHF 3-1000 MHz) - EA only
b.	Millimeter wave (K/Ka Band 18-40 GHz, W Band 75-110 GHz) - EA only
c.	Terahertz (300-3000 GHz)
d.	Long-Wave Infrared (8-12 microns)
e.	Far Infrared (12-100 microns)
f.	Acoustics (open air transmission)

6.2	Exploiting Non-Traditional Signals
The objective is to increase Naval (Navy and Marine Corps) capabilities to detect, locate, track, ID, and counter RF emitters beyond traditional pulsed radar and communications transmitters. Early efforts will focus on detection and exploitation (ESM), followed by electronic attack and denial (EA) as our detection capabilities mature. Potential signal types include:
a.	Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) - EA only
b.	Phase-coded waveforms - EA only
c.	Spread spectrum, frequency hopping signals
d.	Noise-like waveforms
e.	Unintentional RF emissions
f.	Optical communications / data links
g.	Network links

6.3	Countering Passive Detection Systems
The objective is to provide naval (Navy and Marine Corps) capabilities to detect and counter passive detection technologies.  The use of RF passive coherent location (PCL) systems and multi-/hyper-spectral detectors and imagers will be especially challenging because hostile use is not announced through RF or EO/IR emissions.  Novel techniques and technology will be required to degrade or deny these capabilities, including:
a.	Methods to remotely detect and identify passive detection systems
b.	RF deception waveforms and techniques
c.	EO/IR spectral deception or obscuration

6.4	Network-Enabled Electronic Warfare
The objective is to develop modeling and simulation efforts and conduct field trials and demonstrations to explore the advantages and limitations of network-enabled electronic warfare concepts.  The advantages of linking multiple ESM and EA assets to achieve improved capabilities across a networked battleforce have yet to be quantified. Efforts in this area might include:
a.	Test scenario and methodology development
b.	Determination of quantifiable  metrics
c.	Determination of link requirements
d.	Exploration of coordinated vs. scripted interactions
e.	Development of methods to realistically assess the effectiveness of EW employment

The contractor shall provide all onsite maintenance, personnel, equipment, tools, management, training, installation, operations, supervision, and logistic support required to maintain the alarm system.

A key aspect of this contract will be the contractor's ability to have qualified technicians available to respond to alarm problems on a 24 hr/7 day a week basis within a two hour response time and parts available to make a repair, if required.  The project will result in the award of a Firm Fixed Price Contract with a base period and four option periods.  NAICS code is 561621.  This size standard is $11.5M.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) PMA-275 intends to award Delivery Order on a Sole-Source basis under BOA N00019-05-G-0008 to Raytheon Technical Services Corporation (RTSC) to provide services and products in the area of Troop Commander Situational Awareness Improvements for MV-22 Block B aircraft.  This effort requires intricate knowledge of MV-22 Block B avionics systems.  The MV-22 platform is poised for a key program milestone - Initial Operational Capability (IOC), anticipated in June 2007.  RTSC is the only known source that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise required to execute the following effort without significantly impacting scheduling and cost constraints of the program: 

(A) Troop Commander Situational Awareness Improvements will include the development and integration of additional capabilities to already delivered MV-22 Block B aircraft.  This will include Blue Force Tracking beacon capability, improvements that will allow cabin passengers to keep their personal GPS devices updated, and providing a cabin situational awareness device that is a derivative of the V-22 Interactive Situational Awareness System (VISAS).  The VISAS was designed and developed by RTSC, and includes a moving map display of aircraft position, as well as the display of other situational awareness data.

The Navy intends to award a Sole-Source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee Delivery Order for this requirement.  The estimated period of performance is to start 15 February 2007 through 30 November 2007.  The estimated issue date for this Order is 15 February 2007.  This synopsis is for information purposes only.*****

<DESC>Request for Proposals Notice for a Firm Fixed Price Contract for Historical Restoration work for the Interior Upper Floors at the U.S. Courthouse, 401 N. Market St, Wichita, KS.  JOB PCN: RKS27090.  This procurement is a total small business set-aside.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals (Technical and Price) will be evaluated by the Government using source selection procedures.  The Government intends to use the best value concept in making the selections.  The best value concept is a method of evaluating technical qualifications and price as specified in the solicitation; which in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The RFP will be issued on or about 1/23/07.  Proposals shall be received in this office on 2/22/07.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may make an award without discussions.  Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Two factors will be considered:  a technical evaluation factor and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor are in order of importance: (1) Experience of the Firm, (2) Past Performance of the Firm, (3) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (4) Management and Technical Approach.  The Technical factor is more important than the price factor.  As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.  It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from you company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.
Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendors responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions.

Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company?s ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 SMART servers, along with these other components have been identified as key component of the Departments SMART server infrastructure.   IRM ITCCB approved the use of these Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified and classified networks.   These servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility.  These specific servers provide integrated management functions with existing equipment maximizing our return on training investment for support personnel. In addition, the various anticipated Operations and Maintenance owners of SMART deployed technologies utilize similar equipment at this time.   As the SMART program exists for a finite duration, the program seeks to minimize the burden placed on existing O&M organizations by using similar technologies as those already deployed.  Furthermore, these setups are matched to specific configuration needs in the DoS that recur on a regular basis making them virtually interchangeable and simplifying our spare part logistic needs. Finally, standardization preserves our ability to more easily expand with newer server models from the same manufacturer and achieve economies of scale, particularly in test and development environments, with lower overall cost.<BR><BR>The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 Servers, Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 Servers, and related infrastructure equipment described in paragraph (2) have been identified as key components of the Departments SMART server infrastructure which will provide Command and Control message handling, collaboration, Archive and Records Management functions for the Department of State. The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 servers have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and are approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.    Per FAR 8.405-6 (e) (1), this acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.After extensive testing, the HP servers were the only servers found to be compatible with the Departments existing hardware and software.<BR><BR>HP CTO FACTORY BUILT CONFIGURATIONS ARE ACCEPTABLE<BR><BR>ALL SERVER CONFIGURATIONS MUST BE FULLY INTEGRATED PRIOR TO SHIPMENT<BR><BR>REPOSTED TO INCLUDE TERMS: 1) CTO ACCEPBABLE 2) ALL SERVER COMPONENTS MUST BE INTEGRATED COMPLETELY PRIOR TO SHIPMENT AND DELIVERY.<BR><BR>AMENDED LINE ITEMS 002, 004, 008 & 011.<BR><BR>LINE ITEM 005, REDUCED COMPONENT # 410061-B21: HP DL580 G4 Memory Expansion Board FROM QTY FROM 3 EA TO 2 EA<BR><BR>

<SOLNBR>FDA-SOL-07-00127
<RESPDATE>012507
<ARCHDATE>02092007
<CONTACT>Sharon Bradshaw , Contract Specialist , Phone 301-827-8774, Fax 301-827-7106, Email Sharon.Bradshaw@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>This is a synopsis which announces the Food and Drug Administration?s intent to issue solicitation FDA-SOL-07-00127 and award a sole-source contract to Mead Walker Consulting1199 Hopewell Road, Downingtown, PA  19335-1206 for the continuous development of Health Level 7 (HL7) Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) Message for federal government public health surveillance activities.  (Numbered Note #22 applies.)  The upcoming contract will be Year 4 of the study/development; further, 33% of the study/development has already been completed.  There will be a base year plus 4 option years.

The services will include further expansion of FDA and CDC?s HL7 Normative Standards for federal government public health surveillance activities.  There will also be data collection and analysis for FDA?s drug and biologic Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS), Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)?s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE), FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and CDC?s National Disease Surveillance System.
 
Additionally, services will require involvement when the DSC AE Workgroup will engage in extensive planning and system development to implement the ICSR message, including a comprehensive FDA implementation guide, which will be used to support the agency?s new consolidated adverse event reporting portal MedWatchPlus

The FDA has worked exclusively with the contractor for past three years to develop the Health Level 7 (HL7) Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) Message.  The contractor has extensive experience with HL7, and is one of two experienced modelers in HL7 that has direct, relevant experience as an HL7 Modeling Facilitator that has successfully developed messages for the HL7 Public Health Reporting Domain.  The contractor has worked extensively over the past four years with FDA and CDC to develop HL7 Normative Standards for federal government public health surveillance activities.  The contractor is uniquely qualified, in that he already has thorough knowledge and experience with both FDA and CDC regulatory and public health surveillance program requirements.  The contractor has developed standards that support data collection and analysis for FDA?s drug and biologic Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS), Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)?s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE), FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and CDC?s National Disease Surveillance System.
 
The contractor understands FDA?s business processes and analysis requirements for adverse event data reported to the agency, and well as other pre-market regulatory submission requirements that support new drug applications and biologics license applications.  Examples include:  Structured Product Labeling, Stability Data and the International Conference on Harmonisation?s (ICH) Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD).  Additionally, the contractor has been facilitating the development of a new HL7 standard, the Regulated Product Submissions (RPS) message, which is designed to support all new FDA regulated product submissions.  The contractor produces excellent work products, as has successfully coordinated HL7 and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) approval of public health standards:  Case Notification (used by CDC for disease surveillance) and ICSR Release 1 (used by FDA CDRH for piloting electronic submission of device adverse events).  Mead?s ability to translate FDA requirements into HL7 modeling language is exceptional, and has contributed to the overall success of our work over the past three years.  The learning curve for a new contractor to understand all FDA adverse event requirements, based upon several FDA data collection systems and forms, international requirements (ICH and Veterinary ICH), and the HL7 modeling, software tools and balloting process is substantial.  
 
The FDA Data Standards Council (DSC) would like to minimize the amount of ballot preparation and review fatigue and resource commitments necessary to orient and train a new contractor.  The DSC AE Workgroup will also be engaged in extensive planning and system development to implement the ICSR message, including a comprehensive FDA implementation guide, which will be used to support the agency?s new consolidated adverse event reporting portal MedWatchPlus.  This concurrent work will greatly reduce the amount of time and assistance that can be devoted to bringing a new contractor up to speed on the standard, and facilitate our goal to consolidate AE reporting formats within the agency.
 
The 2006 contract agreement with the contractor already included data requirements gathering and analysis for the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM),  the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) and the Office of Combination Products (OCP).  These new requirements will be used to develop Release 2 of the ICSR message, which FDA intends to implement for MedWatchPlus.   The contractor?s understanding of how AERS, VAERS, and MAUDE accepts, processes and archives data will contribute greatly to his efforts to migrate CVM, CFSAN and OCP data into the existing model structure (ICSR Release 1), and provide the design basis for release 2.  Given the contractor?s exceptional performance on previous FDA and CDC contracts and experience with HL7, the DSC is confident that the contractor will continue to do an outstanding job, and is better positioned to work more independently to develop the necessary requirements analysis documents, HL7 project descriptions, Refined Message Information Models (RMIMs), data artifacts and ballot materials for successful acceptance and approval of the ICSR Release 2 message.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO EXTEND THE RESPONSE DATE TO FRIDAY, JANUARY 19, 2007 FROM FRIDAY, JANUARY  12, 2007.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSIONS ARE DUE NOT-LATER-THAN MID-NIGHT, FRIDAY, JANUARY 19, 2007.     THIS MSTAR BAA IS REISSUED IN ITS ENTIRETY.  THIS IS HQ0006-06-MSTAR-BAA MODIFICATION 04.    

The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States, US allies and friends from ballistic missile attack. The Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, kinetic energy systems, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost Phase through Midcourse and into Terminal Phase.  

MDA efforts will make the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and able to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries.  In addition, the BMDS must function without extensive detailed a-priori knowledge of our adversary?s systems.  Wherever adversaries launch, to whatever target they choose, MDA must be able to detect, track, identify and kill the ballistic missile.

In support of these efforts, MDA programs are geared towards advancing technological thresholds in hardware and software, through fundamental scientific breakthroughs in areas such as mathematics, physics, and engineering.  This push is essential to the strategy of spiral development with Block improvements in the BMDS every two years.  

MDA advances technology that enables near-term, evolutionary growth in current systems while adding revolutionary systems to substantially improve the BMDS in the far term.  The MDA Advanced Technology Deputate (DV) is responsible for developing advanced capabilities for the BMDS. This includes planning and executing a broad range of enabling and advanced technology development efforts, developing the technology base for advanced BMDS Blocks, assessing emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and leading the effort to develop advanced algorithms for improving BMDS capability.
  
MDA/DV has instituted the Missile Defense Science, Technology And Research (MSTAR) Program in order to sponsor fundamental, BMDS relevant research and development at accredited United States universities and academic institutions as well as to support training of future scientists and engineers in the field of missile defense.  The MSTAR Program, administered by MDA/DV, is designed to identify and develop new and innovative concepts, stimulate technology innovation, and exploit breakthroughs in science to offer robust technology improvements to all elements of the BMDS.  MSTAR is a competitive, science and technology university research program, which consists of forefront research and development technology, concepts, and approaches acquired through scientific and technological investigation.

<DESC>TITLE:  F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) Modernization Program BACKGROUND:  The F-15 ESTS Modernization Program is an Aeronautical  Systems Center (ASC) program.  The F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS)  is an Intermediate  level support equipment system providing maintenance  & repair for approximately 50 F-15 Line Replaceable Units (LRU).  The  system consists of a station, Interface Test Adapters (ITA), ancillary  equipment, and associated cables located at all F-15 operating locations  and the depot at Robins as well as Northrop-Grumman, Rolling Meadows, Ill.  The station (62 units) itself will become increasingly difficult to  maintain and ultimately unsustainable beginning in FY08 unless known  obsolescence for a variety of component parts is addressed.  A projected  component obsolescence analysis is attached for reference purposes. PURPOSE:  The F-15 Systems Group, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting a  survey to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise,  capabilities, and experience to analyze ESTS station instrument  obsolescence as currently fielded, identify potential solutions for same,  and demonstrate capability to replace obsolete parts as necessary.  The  overarching program objective is to avoid stations becoming Not Mission  Capable (NMC).  The government plans to issue, at a later date, a request  for proposal that will require offerors to provide a plan that provides  retrofit hardware improvements addressing obsolete parts within the  planned funding profile and meets the overarching program objective.  The  planned funding profile is as follows:  FY08 - $4.5M, FY09 - $12.1M,  FY10 - $13.4M, FY11 - $19.6M.  Respondents should maximize addressing the  projected component obsolescence issues within the planned funding  profile, i.e., address as many components as possible with the given  amount of funding.  In addition, offerors will be required to demonstrate  improvement to station MTBF as well as meeting the current performance  requirements.  In order to assist respondents with replying to this  sources sought synopsis a draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) is attached. CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY:  Firms responding to this announcement  should indicate whether they are a large or small business, small  disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, HUB Zone small  business and/or service disabled veteran-owned small business.  In  addition to the information requested above, please provide the following  information:  Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, CAGE Code, Phone  Number, E-mail address, Web Page URL.  In addition to the information  above, interested firms should also submit sufficient information (limited  to 25 pages) that will permit insight into their technical capabilities. 1.	Provide experience and expertise in aspects related to addressing  obsolescence of electronic equipment in general and specifically  obsolescence associated with support equipment. 2.

<DESC>1.0	INTRODUCTION

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates interceptor aircraft to detect, deter and mitigate threats to our homeland such as terrorists, acts of terrorism, drug smuggling and other unlawful movement of people, money, and goods across U.S. borders.  CBP wishes to explore the feasibility and practicality of upgrading the avionics and mission systems, initially on its 10 Citation II Lot III jets and potentially the remaining 16 Citation II jets.  The intent of the upgrade is to improve their operational efficiency and effectiveness as well as lower life cycle support costs.  To reduce program costs and enhance equipment availability and support, the avionics and sensor systems should incorporate open architecture and "commercial-off-the-shelf" non-developmental item equipment to the maximum extent possible.  Those systems must be cost effective to operate and fully supportable (parts, technical assistance, etc.) for 20 years beyond the date of acquisition.  They should also be currently in production, operationally viable (demonstrable) and capable of being easily retrofitted with updated configurations. 



2.0	REQUEST

CBP is seeking information on prime contractors who can install and integrate commercially available avionics and sensor systems, including electronic flight instrument displays that are night vision goggle compatible and reduced visual separation minimum (RVSM) compliant.  The sensor suite will include multi-mode radar and electro-optical/ infrared (EO/IR) sensors.  System performance, size, weight, power and cooling requirements and life cycle support will be important considerations for this modernization effort.  The Maximum combined weight for the complete integrated Radar and EO/IR system shall not exceed 370 pounds.  Interested vendors must be capable of demonstrating their avionics and sensor systems as an integrated end product.  



MINIMUM OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS (GENERAL):



2.1	Radar System

AN/APG-66 radar, which are currently installed in the modified noses of CBP Citation Interceptor jets, are integrated with EO/IR sensors and capable of slewing EO/IR tracked targets.  Replacement radar should have comparable system performance, size, weight, power and cooling requirements as that radar.  At a minimum, the radar should provide 120-degree azimuth and elevation coverage with an automatic capability to detect and track air and surface targets.  Radar capabilities should include the following:

	Air-to-air radar detection, tracking and sorting of various size aircraft;
	Air-to-ground radar detection, tracking and sorting of moving vehicles;
	Air-to-sea radar detection, tracking and sorting of various size vessels;
	Air-to-ground high-resolution radar imaging;
       Radar Slave to EO/IR Functionality;
	10 target (minimum) Track While Scan mode; and
	2 target (minimum) Situation Awareness Mode (SAM)

The radar system should include a Built-in-Test (BIT) mode to accomplish failure detection and failure isolation to a Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) without the assistance of radar support equipment at the organization level.

<DESC>QUESTION 1----Performance Specification dated 12 December 2006 cites requirements from Joint Service Sensitive Equipment Decontamination (JSSED) and Joint Platform Interior Decontamination (JPID) Capability Development Documents (CDD).  We would like  to request a copy of the CDDs from JSSED and JPID......ANSWER 1-----As stated in the synopsis notice and amendment, the only documents provided with the draft RFP are the SOW and Performance Specifications which are provided as preliminary information for  clarification purposes only. When the final solicitation is released, all applicable information and attachments and/or exhibits will be provided........QUESTION 2------The draft Statement of Work dated 4 December 2006 is cited as document/appendix  C .  Are there documents A, B, or D applicable to this RFP, and if so, we would like to request a copy of them?......ANSWER 2------The  C  you are referring to is the Section of the final solicitation that will incorporate the SOW in accordance with FAR 15.204 -1 uniform contract format.......QUESTION 3------I am very interested in responding to RFP W911SR-07-R-0002 when it is released.  To prepare for it I request copies of the applicable documents listed in section 2.2 of the Performance Specification. We alre ady have MIL-STD-810F listed in 2.2.1 so will not need it.......ANSWER 3-------All websites for applicable documents are included in the draft Statement of Work on pages 2 thru 6, Paragraphs C.2.1 thru C.2.6.5. For example MIL-STD documents are available a t http://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch.....QUESTION 4------On Page 5 of the draft statement of work, PART I is labeled System Development and Demonstration (SDD) and the SOW that follows corresponds to an SDD. However, SDD implies a Milestone B accomplis hment and an MDA approval of a contractors system (or waiver thereof) to enter SDD. Therefore, is it the Governments intention to limit this solicitation to Contractors who already have a MDA approval to enter SDD, and if so what system(s) has already rec eived such approval?......ANSWER 4-------The Government has no intention of limiting this solicitation to contractors who already have a MDA approval.  The MDA has granted a JMDS MS B approval due to the maturity of the technology and previous work done by  S&T and the JSSED and JPID programs.  This solicitation is opened to all contractors who can present a solution that meets the performance specifications with the proper data backing up their claims.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC), 46th Test Systems Squadron, 46 TSSQ/TSSP, is seeking potential sources to design, develop, integrate, test, and produce demonstration quantities of a universal, non-intrusive, miniaturized flight safety system that can be used to support the test and  evaluation of live and inert weapons.    The core SFSS will include a Main Controller/Encoder/GPS Sensor module, dual Flight Termination Receivers, dual Power Conditioners and dual Safe & Arm (S&A) Controllers.  A removable Telemetry Transmitter and Encryption module, dual S&A Explosive Fireset and S&A Explosive Bolt modules will also be considered part of this development effort.  Sample size and form factor is represented in Diagram 1 (attached separately).

The North American Industry Classification Series (NAICS) code for this effort is 541710, size standard 1000 employees.  Firms responding to this sources sought are asked to provide the following information in their response: company?s full name, business size, address, point of contact, and a complete capability/qualifications package, describing the company?s capabilities to meet the following prioritized criteria and system requirements through the use of technically capable and experienced personnel, facilities, and equipment.  See numbered note 25.  

General Capabilities:
  
1.	Ability to meet COMSEC requirements for encryption development that must include the ability to obtain NSA I803 approval for embedded encryption. 
2.	Meet an aggressive schedule which includes completion of all system modules, and integration of modules into a completed and qualified SFSS prototype within 24 months of contract award.
3.	Organic knowledge of the full spectrum of technologies associated with developing and qualification testing with a weapon?s environmental profile to include use of TM, GPS, Encryption, Power Conditioning, and S&A devices.
4.	The SFSS must comply with Range Commanders Council Standard 319-99 (RCC 319-99) which includes redundancy, elimination of single point failures, and system independence to preclude any type of weapon failure (i.e. power supply, etc.) from interfering with the operation of the FTS.  

System Specific Requirements:

1.	The Main Controller/Encoder/GPS module will be responsible for data collection and management, configuration, and system test functions and will provide direct/dedicated interfaces to the other modules.  As a threshold, the Encoder will format the data for Pulse Coded Modulation (PCM) transmission and the GPS sensor will provide near-real time, fast acquisition position data, compatible with the Joint Advance Missile Instrumentation ground stations. 
2.	The Flight Termination Receivers must be compatible with the digital Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) waveforms and EFTS ground instrumentation systems.
3.	The Power Conditioner modules regulate, monitor, and distribute power to all other modules.  The Power Conditioner modules must accept voltages of 28 VDC from the aircraft and 7 VDC from external batteries.  
4.	The S&A Controller modules convert the serial command words from the Flight Termination Receivers, monitors first motion, safe separation, and umbilical disconnect signals, and includes accelerometers to determine launch status.   
5.	The removable Telemetry Transmitter module must be programmable over the range of 2200.5 MHz to 2299.5 MHz in one MHz increments and as a threshold be compatible with standard PCM schemes.  Minimum data rate must be 2 Mbps.
6.	The KGV-682 encryption module will be provided GFE to the contractor.  This item must be integrated into the SFSS design.
7.	The removable S&A Explosive Fireset module receives signals from the S&A Controller and converts the output into a shock wave capable of detonating a secondary explosive device.
8.	The removable S&A Explosive Bolt module receives signals from the S&A Controller and provides a sufficient current to activate an explosive bolt device. 
9.	The threshold and objective volumes of the SFSS without explosive modules are 9 in3 and 6 in3 respectively.  
10.	Maximum height including all modules will not exceed 2.1 inches.  
11.	The SFSS core system with Telemetry, Encryption, and S&A Explosive Fireset modules must operate using less than 35 Watts. 
12.	The SFSS will support air-to-surface, air-to-air, surface-to-air, and surface-to-surface weapon testing.
13.	The SFSS will be qualified to cover representative high dynamic weapon environments.

The purpose of that cooperative agreement is to advance the knowledge and technologies for highway crash analyses; the specific objectives are to:

1)Conduct advanced vehicle, highway, and roadside research to assist researchers and engineers in understanding and resolving transportation safety issues;
2)Advance state-of-the-art crash analysis methods and technologies;
3)Combine and maintain FHWA and National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test films and documentation collected over the past several decades into a single national library;
4)Conduct crash testing to validate computer models and produce relevant data for crash analysis to improve highway and vehicle safety;
5)Provide an environment for visiting scholars to interact with, and conduct, vehicle, highway, and roadside safety research using the wealth of data and facilities available; 
6)Support educational opportunities to graduate students in one of the few Safety Engineering program in the world; and
7)Share the resources, findings, data, models, and technologies with others to expedite the application of advanced crash analysis methods for addressing complex vehicle and highway safety problems.

The awardee selected will be expected to have capabilities in:

1)Vehicle Safety and Biomechanics Research-Capabilities to undertake efforts that focus on reducing injuries and fatalities by analyzing vehicle pre-crash, crash and post-crash events and scenarios. Researchers should be conversant in current and relevant topics in automotive safety to gain a better understanding of injury risk. 
2)Highway Safety and Infrastructure Research-Capabilities to build and apply  comprehensive and robust tools for designing and evaluating the crashworthiness of roadside devices during impacts to reduce the injuries and fatalities that occur on U.S. roadways. 
3)Simulation and Advanced Computing Research-Capabilities to develop detailed finite elements models and simulate a full range of crash scenarios on cutting-edge, high-performance computers for safety and security application. Research continues to directly improve regulations, vehicle design, occupant protection, roadside hardware, and physical protection. 

The awardee must have expertise and experience related to: 
1) Finite Element Analyses (FEA) that includes model building and crash simulation analyses; 2) reverse engineering of highway vehicles and roadside hardware as the basis for building detailed FEA models (i.e., vehicle models in the 1 million element range); 3) managing and operating a comprehensive crash test library that includes over 20,000 films, reports, or datasets (and electronic versions of all of these), and providing authenticated copies of the crash information on request; 4) utilizing high performance computers  running a variety of highly sophisticated software (e.g., LS DYNA and vehicle dynamics models); 5) evaluating crash data and applications of techniques for detailed statistical analysis of the data; 6) maintaining a state-of-the-art website and use a variety of technologies for the dissemination of research findings;  7) understanding Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), Crashworthiness standards for roadside hardware (NCHRP 350), and other programs for the design and testing of highway vehicles; and 8) investigating human body or dummy reactions in crash events and the risks to occupants of all ages.  The awardee will also be responsible for operating and maintaining, or for arranging for the conduct of, an impacts lab (including capabilities ranging from test planning to the effective deployment of high speed video cameras, accelerometers, and other data capture devices, as well as the preparation of test vehicles and articles) to cost effectively conduct full-scale vehicle crash tests or component tests using pendulums or hydraulic sleds in support of the development or exercise of the models.

The awardee will be expected to provide facilities for: 
1) reverse engineering; 2) high performance computing including support for software packages such as LS DYNA, Madymo, and Highway Vehicle Environment (HVE) and supporting up to thirty users; 3) housing the library and equipment to support the conversion, processing, and retrieval of information from the library collection; and 4) impact lab for full-scale and component tests.  Note the awardee could potentially assume management of the FHWA?s Federal Outdoor Impact Facility (FOIL) for crash testing, but there is the potential that the FOIL will lose a major capability (i.e., the main accelerator) before the end of the proposed procurement. This may entail contracting for full-scale crash tests at other facilities. Other capabilities or facilities that would be considered useful include editorial and document production services, training staff, and access to training facilities. 

The estimated period of performance for the project is five years.  FHWA anticipates a level of effort ranging from 12 to 20 professional and technical staff members per year for the duration of the project.  Past efforts have also involved 10 - 25 students, mostly at graduate levels. FHWA is considering a cost share arrangement for this procurement. 

Note: the level of activity will greatly depend on continued and additional funding under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) to FHWA and NHTSA than what is currently provided.

Note: The resulting Request for Application or Request for Proposal may include a proximity clause.

<CONTACT>Rose Mary Spearman, 903/334-2604
<DESC>Red River Army Depot,Texarkana,TX is soliciting interested sources who have the capability, engineering background, and experience to provide turnkey robotic solutions for four projects. The projects are (1) Robotic Material Handlers for Injection Mo lding Press Line. The current process of loading and unloading roadwheels into injection molding presses is presently done by an operator using a jib hoist in conjunction with a pick and place mechanical load arm.  The primary goal is to improve all aspect s of loading/unloading the injection molds by elimination of manual material handling, reduction of material handling time between the load/unload machine cycle, and improvement of the flow of product through the equipment.  A secondary project objective i s to use the robot to orient and assemble M1 Abram Tank wear flanges with the cured roadwheels. (2)Robotic Cell to Prepare and Apply Adhesive to Roadwheels. The existing equipment process line requires two rubber workers to stamp ID numbers into the wheels , sand(garnet) blast the surface of the wheels, and spray the wheels with primer and top coat metal to rubber bonding adhesive. The goal of this project is to replace the two operator with a single operator whose only function is to maintain the spray equi pment and monitor system operation.  The proposed robot cell will be U shaped with the robot located to reach an automated blast booth, preheat oven, and spray booth.  (3)Robotic Material Palletizer for the T-107 Disassembly Line. The T-107 disassembly lin e is used to remove center guides, wedge bolts, end connectors, and to break the track rolls into single links weighing 65 pounds each. A robotic material handler will be used to remove links from the end connector removal equipment and place them on a pal let for transport to the fluidized bed. The primary goal of the new robot cell will be the elimination of manual material handling. A secondary project objective is the incorporation of the robotic material hnadling function with a complete system upgradin g to increase throughput.  (4)Robotic Adhesive Application for Track Shoes. Pallets of track shoes are delivered to the spray booth by forklift. A new process is being considered that uses a robot positioned upside down above the pallets of track shoes to apply the adhesive. The robot will travel over the pallets on rails from one end of the booth to the other end. A secondary project objective under consideration is automating pallet movement through the spray booth.  Please respond by letter or email indi cation your capability to meet these requirements, and a desire to be considered in future acquisitions of this nature. E-mail to you respond to rose.m.spearman@us.army.mil,or fax to (903) 334-4141 to Ms. Rose Mary Spearman.

<SUBJECT>R -- Notification of NEW FAS MAS Express Program
<DESC>On January 16, 2007, the General Services Administration, Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) will introduce the MAS Express Program (referred to as ?MAS Express? in this document).  MAS Express is a pilot program designed to accelerate new Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) contract awards by allowing proposals submitted by Offerors who meet specific criteria for certain products to be awarded significantly faster, with a long-term goal of awarding within 30 calendar days.  

MAS Express offers several benefits to GSA customers and prospective GSA contractors.  The near-term benefit will result in a reduction in the amount of time it takes to process an offer.  This will make products and services available quicker to GSA?s customers.  The program will also allow for streamlined collaboration and communications between the contractor and GSA Contracting personnel.  

To be eligible for MAS Express, Offerors will be required to successfully complete an education program called ?Pathway to Success.?

The ?Pathway to Success? education is available via live sessions or online at http://vsc.gsa.gov, Vendor Training.  The ?Pathway to Success? program is primarily intended to assist contractors to help make the business decision if it is in their best interests to have a MAS contract.  It also includes discussion sessions covering:

?	the proposal submission process and the MAS solicitation
?	the obligations involved in being a Schedule contractor
?	How an offeror must differentiate itself, by pricing, service, delivery, and/or terms and conditions, in order to be competitive and attract Federal customers
?	opportunities that are available through  MAS Express 

Offerors will receive certificates for completing ?Pathway to Success,? which they must submit with their offers.  These certificates are valid for one year, and the employee attending the presentation must still be employed by the company at the time of proposal submission.

Additional MAS Express Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for the MAS Express, a company must first offer products from the following selected MAS Special Item Numbers (SINs) from five Schedules.  The eligible SINs are product specific (with associated maintenance) where the pricing history is straightforward and well-defined.


Schedule  Special Item Number (SIN)	Description
70	    132-8, 132-12	IT Hardware / Repair & Maintenance

        EXCLUDES 19-100	       Photographic Equipment

                Equipment

In addition, Offerors must meet all other MAS Express criteria.  The basis of the additional criteria is to demonstrate that the Offorer?s company is financially sound, has a proven track record of sales and is willing to offer GSA its best pricing.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Monochramatic Cryo Filter Exchanger (MCFX)
<DESC>***THIS IS A SPECIAL NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED CONTRACTORS REGARDING A PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE TO BE HELD AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST) IN GAITHERSBURG, MARYLAND.

All contractors interested in providing a proposal for a Monochromatic Cryo Filter Exchange system (MCFX) (described below) are encouraged to attend.  If interested but unable to attend the conference, please notify the Contracting Officer, Todd Hill, at todd.hill@nist.gov.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.  However, this acquisition is expected to be unrestricted; therefore any interested offeror may submit a proposal.

A fixed-price contract is anticipated.

BACKGROUND:

The purpose of this contract is to design and manufacture a cryogenic neutron filter system for the Multi-Axis Crystal Spectrometer (MACS). This system is denoted the Monochromatic Cryo Filter Exchange system (MCFX). Specialized materials for neutron filtering will be delivered by the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). When maintained at cryogenic temperatures, these materials have high transmission for low neutron energies but they are opaque for unwanted high energy neutrons. The role of the MCFX system is to maintain suitable filter materials at cryogenic temperatures and to hold them in correct locations with respect to one another. By placing the cooled filter blocks between the sample and the detectors a background suppressing filter action is achieved. To avoid neutron transmission between filter blocks, interstitial volumes are filled with highly neutron absorbing material in the form of B4C cast into polyurethane. Specification documents and drawings are attached under this Special Notice.

The period of performance of the base Conceptual Design period shall be approximately 3 months from the date of award.  It is anticipated that two option periods will be included in the contract.  The Detailed Design period, option 1, shall be approximately 2 months from the date of option exercise.  The Manufacture, Assembly, and Test; option 2, shall be approximately 6 months from the date of option exercise.

PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE:

NIST will host a pre-solicitation conference at the NIST facility in Gaithersburg, MD to discuss specific requirements of the MCFX, to familiarize potential offerors with the physical environment in which the MCFX will be installed, to provide material samples and electronic data referenced in the specification, and to answer questions on the requirement.

The conference shall take place on January 23, 2006 from 1:00 P.M. to 4:00 P.M. EST.

Attendees shall convene at NIST, NCNR, 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, MD, Building 235, Room B166 (room number subject to change depending upon the number of attendees).

<SUBJECT>B -- Space Threat Assessment Testbed (STAT)
<DESC>1.  SCOPE.
This request for information is directed to potential prime contractors who have demonstrated experience in the design, development, and integration of new satellite test capabilities.  The Government will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to refine potential acquisition strategies for the STAT.  Further, this information will help the Government structure a program that will mitigate cost, schedule and performance risks.

2.   OBJECTIVES.  
The main objectives in this project are as follows:
1. Design the STAT Spiral 1 facility.
2. Develop integrated environmental source and infrastructure control systems. 
3. Procure all necessary hardware that is not provided GFE.
4. Integrate the environmental sources, chamber subsystems, controls and Satellite Operation Center Links into a functional test capability.

3.  REQUIREMENTS.
The Space Threat Assessment Testbed shall have real time capability for emulating the natural and man-made space environment at various orbital conditions.  It shall also incorporate three operationally realistic man-made threat sources, and the ability to connect the System Under Test (SUT) to a satellite operations center (SOC).  The following are operational and system specifications or limitations applicable to the design and development of this System:

3.1	Operational:  The Space Threat Assessment Testbed shall emulate a complex natural and man-made space environment, to include realistic flux levels and/or fluences of the atomic oxygen, low energy protons, electrons, UV, contamination, and spacecraft charging.  It will also include three operationally relevant threat sources, and the ability to connect the payload to the Satellite Operations Center.
  
3.1.1	The system shall emulate the appropriate conditions for orbits ranging from Low Earth Orbit to Geosynchronous and Sun-Synchronous orbits.
  
3.1.2	The System shall have the capability to operate the threat sources and the environmental source in a controlled manner to simulate realistic combined environmental conditions experienced by operational systems.

3.1.3	The system shall allow the connection of the System Under Test (SUT) to be connected to a remote Satellite Operations Center at the Center for Research Support (CERES) at Falcon AFB, Colorado, and shall monitor the data streams being fed over the control networks to ensure they meet all applicable standards and regulations.

3.1.4	The system shall allow real-time control of all sources to allow scripting of environmental and/or induced anomaly situations to be simulated.

3.2	Chamber Infrastructure:  An 8ft by 24ft vacuum chamber located at Arnold Engineering Development Center will be made available as GFE for this effort.  Integration of vacuum pumping and cryogenic systems, as well as an integrated control system shall be accomplished by the contractor.  Electrical Power (up to 440V 3-phase), water, compressed air and dry Nitrogen are all available through the existing building infrastructure.

3.3	Natural Environment Sources:

3.3.1	The system shall include atomic oxygen generation capabilities capable of simulating energy levels and fluxes representative of the levels experienced in Low Earth Orbits.  

3.3.2	The system shall include low energy proton acceleration capabilities capable of simulating fluences seen at solar max.

3.3.3	The system shall include UV lamps capable of simulating the solar spectra at 2 times solar intensity.

3.3.4	The system shall include electron acceleration capabilities capable of simulating trapped electrons.
 
3.4	Spacecraft Self-induced Condition Simulation:

3.4.1	The system shall include the capability to introduce controlled levels of contamination to simulate the outgassing and redeposition of other satellite materials on the System Under Test.

3.4.2	The system shall include ion acceleration sources capable of simulating electric propulsion back-flux of low-energy Xenon ions.

3.4.3	The system shall include the capability to introduce an electric potential on the surface of the System Under Test to simulate the effects of spacecraft self-charging.

3.5	Threat Sources:  The system shall include three operationally relevant threat sources capable of simulating the effects of those threats on the satellite.

3.6	Connectivity to Satellite Operations Center:  The System shall allow the payload to be connected to the Satellite Operations Center in the Center for Research Support (CERES) at Schriever AFB, CO.  This will allow integrated operational test and evaluation, crew training, anomaly resolution utilizing actual hardware, the development of tactics, techniques and procedures, and assessment of system level vulnerabilities to natural and induced environments.  Due to the possibility of early utilization of the CCOSE chamber (see below) in Tactics, Techniques and Procedures development, connectivity must be achieved within the first 3 months of the program.

3.7	Existing Prototype:  The existing CCOSE chamber, located at AEDC was developed under the Test Technology Development and Demonstration program, and represents a subscale prototype and risk reduction effort.  This facility, and the technologies incorporated into it will be made available to the contractor to use in the development of the STAT facility.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-108 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541618 and the business size standard is $6.5M.  However, this is not set aside for small businesses.  This solicitation is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Fogarty International Center (FIC) with support from the Ellison Medical Foundation (EMF) in providing management and support of FIC program which provides opportunities for U.S. doctoral students in health sciences to engage in clinical research training at selected research center in developing countries.  The program is primarily designed for advanced level medical students at U.S. medical schools and doctoral level students at schools of public health. Applications from other doctoral level health professional students are also welcomed. It is the intent to procure with the Association of American Medical Colleges, 2450 N St. NW, Washington, DC 20037 to  partner with the FIC in the management of the program.  The following tasks are identified:  
Task: Develop descriptive materials and publicize the program; Understanding:  Although the fellowship program is open to doctoral level trainees in the health professions, the principal targets are students of accredited medical schools and accredited schools of public health.   Accordingly, it is essential that medical students, public health doctoral-level candidates (PhD and DrPH), and their advisors be made aware of the program.  As for other health professions, we believe that doctoral- level students in dental, osteopathic, and nursing schools are the major populations that should be included.  The Fellowship Program must have an appropriate web presence with information that is both accurate and useful to current and past participants as well as potential applicants and their advisors.  Specific AAMC/ASPH Tasks:  The AAMC and Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH) will use all of their appropriate communications vehicles to make medical students, doctoral-level public health students and their advisors aware of the Fellowship program.  The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), Deans of Nursing Schools, the National Institute for Nursing Research (NIH), the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM), and the American Dental Education Association (ADEA) will be made aware of the program.  Messages to appropriate listserves will be written and distributed, notices will be placed in various AAMC publications, and a one-page, two-color, tri-fold style flier will be created and distributed.  The AAMC, in consultation with ASPH and FIC, will continue to monitor the Fellowship web site that provides detailed information about the program and the participating institutions.  Links to program sites and the application will be maintained.  Sets of FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) will be updated for various audiences (applicants, advisors, parents, etc.).  Efforts to publicize the program will also utilize the site as an information and promotion link.  Individual program sites will be monitored and suggestions will be made, when appropriate.  However, the responsibility for maintaining individual program sites will remain the responsibility of the individual programs.  Specific Fogarty International Center Tasks:  The FIC will participate in the preparation and review of the web site, FAQs, and programmatic materials, as appropriate. The FIC will publicize the program through its own networks and through government publications.  2) Task: Foster the application process across schools;  Understanding: The AAMC and ASPH will work with institutions engaged in the graduate training of health professionals to publicize the program and solicit applications from a broad range of candidates. Each educational institution will be responsible for developing its own procedures for making the program known to its students and encouraging applications.  Specific AAMC/ASPH Tasks:  The application forms and process will be managed by AAMC, in consultation with FIC, and will be posted on the Fellowship web site.  Screening will be conducted by an internal process established by AAMC.  ASPH will review applications from public health students.  Specific Fogarty International Center Tasks:  As above.  3) Task:  Implementation of a selection process in choosing finalist pool of applicants:  Understanding: As stated.   Specific AAMC/ASPH Tasks:  AAMC, in consultation with ASPH and FIC, will develop a roster of external reviewers and an evaluation instrument.  Screened applications will be circulated and evaluations returned by email.  The number of finalists will depend on the number of applications, the number of open positions, and the evaluations.  The goal will be to have a ratio of around 2:1.  AAMC will host an External Review Committee meeting in January at which time all committee members will meet to make final decisions about the top candidates to be invited to attend the annual interview conference in March.   Specific Fogarty International Center Tasks:  As above.  4) Selection and Assignment of Awardees: Understanding:  The finalists will be invited to an annual scheduled conference at NIH in early March, at which time the Steering Committee will also meet.  There, the finalists will be able to meet with prior fellows, explore opportunities with mentors, and be interviewed by site representatives and members of the Steering Committee.  The Steering Committee will make the final assignments based on input from the program mentors and candidates? preferences, as well as the assessments from the finalist selection committee and other sources.  AAMC and ASPH will participate in this process via their membership on the Steering Committee.  Specific AAMC Tasks:  AAMC will develop for the conference a schedule of appointments for student finalists and interviewees.  The student finalists will have the opportunity to speak with FIC site representatives (each of the FIC foreign site?s U.S. partners and/or the foreign program site representative) to determine their interest level and then will submit to the Steering Committee a rank-order list of their top preferences for site assignment.  The AAMC will develop a process by which Steering Committee members may interview the student finalists and determine final assignments.  Specific Fogarty International Center Tasks:  FIC will determine among their program sites the U.S. partners and foreign program site representatives that will participate in the annual meeting.  The FIC will play the lead role in working with the Steering Committee to match the finalists? interests to foreign sites and mentors.   Following selection and assignment, Fogarty will be fully responsible for the awardees.  5) Task: Organization and Logistics of annual Interview/Site Selection Meeting in Early March:  Understanding:  The annual conference will be held on the NIH campus. The goals of the meeting include programmatic review by the Steering Committee, presentations of research accomplishments by ?alumni? of the program, and activities related to the selection and assignment of the incoming finalists.  Each annual meeting will provide an opportunity for the finalists to interact with the alumni fellows, and permit adequate time for socialization among the finalists and the alumni. Specific AAMC/ASPH Tasks:  AAMC will organize and have responsibility for the on-site logistics of the conference.  This will include the arrangement of meeting participant travel and overnight accommodations as necessary; ground transportation from an area hotel to the NIH campus; securing of catering; organization of any audio visual equipment needs; the dissemination of conference materials or related communications; oversight of printing/creative services, and the staffing of a welcome/registration table.  ASPH will assist AAMC through their membership on the Steering Committee and by providing on-site meeting assistance.  Specific Fogarty International Center Tasks:  FIC will be responsible for securing the meeting space facility and the direct charges for meeting costs, including:  meeting participant travel; accommodations, food; meeting participant incidental charges; ground transportation from an area hotel to the NIH campus; meeting management services; audio visual costs; speaker honoraria (if any); information dissemination costs to include printing services, and food and beverages.  The cost of the meeting are included in the total contract costs.  6) Task: Pre-Training Preparation: Understanding:  Following the annual selection conference, up to 30 applicants will be selected as Fogarty Fellows.  The Fellows will need guidance and preparation for their year abroad. Specific AAMC Tasks: The AAMC, in consultation with FIC, will announce the final Fellowship decisions, provide guidance and preparation materials (prepared by FIC) to the selected Fellows, and make updates to the Fogarty website.  Specific Fogarty International Center Tasks: FIC will be responsible for determining the preparation and guidance of the selected fellows, and for preparing any supportive materials for AAMC?s dissemination.  7) Task: Development and implementation of new participant orientation program:  Understanding:  New Fellowship participants will be brought together at NIH in July for a three-week intensive orientation program that will include instruction in the bioethical framework of patient-oriented clinical research, research methodology, and advice regarding personal health and safety.  Specific AAMC/ASPH Tasks: AAMC and ASPH will participate in the general orientation of the new Fellows and be recognized as a resource of the program.  Specific Fogarty International Center Tasks: FIC will bear the entire responsibility for the Fellowship?s orientation program planned for July on the NIH campus.  8) Task: Maintaining a U.S. mentoring: Understanding:  It is important for the trainees? home institutions, the directors of the clinical research training programs, and FIC staff to cooperate with AAMC in designing and implementing the tracking system. The primary source of follow up information for medical student participants will come from the home institutions until such time as the trainees apply for/receive NIH funding (training or research) and/or receive a faculty appointment in a medical school.  Due to the fact that the AAMC is not able to track non-medical students who are likely to choose careers in their own professional fields (e.g., the CDC, schools of public health, state health programs, etc.) a post card size reminder asking them to go to the Fellowship?s web site and complete a brief questionnaire/survey will be mailed to program participants every other year for a total of fourteen years, inquiring about their current career status, including training and research awards, publications, and employment.  Each participating fellow will sign an agreement upon acceptance into the program stating that he/she will respond in a timely manner.  Also important is the component of the program that involves fellow mentoring.  Mentoring will be the responsibility of the trainees? home institutions, the directors of the clinical research training programs, and FIC staff.  The cognizant mentors are expected to file a progress report with FIC at the end of the FIC fellow?s first post-fellowship year (before the individual graduates from the home institution) detailing their mentoring activities and the fellow?s follow-on accomplishments, if any.   Ongoing program evaluation will be measured via entrance and exit surveys of participant expectations.  The surveys will be distributed to fellows during the program?s orientation period and upon completion of the students? one-year fellowship. This process may help identify problem programs and mentors.  Specific AAMC/ASPH Tasks:  AAMC will continue to maintain a student tracking system, subject to the constraints identified above.  Staff also will develop ways to use existing AAMC (and, as necessary, AMA) databases to track graduate and residency information for program participants and applicants, and will contact institutions seeking information for those participants and applicants whose information is missing or incomplete.  ASPH will continue to coordinate with AAMC in order to provide input into the maintenance of appropriate tracking systems for SPH fellows. ASPH will also work with SPH fellows to develop information on their research and general fellowship experience, in order to provide better marketing pieces to attract future applicants.  Regarding the established mentoring component, the AAMC will continue to manage the system only as far as posting to the fellowship web site a listing of mentoring assignments and contact information.  AAMC will develop with FIC approval entry and exit surveys and be responsible for evaluation of the results.  Specific Fogarty International Center Tasks:  Cooperation, as above.  In addition, FIC will develop, oversee and have full responsibility for a mentoring system at the participating domestic sites.  9) Task: Student tracking system and provide ongoing program evaluation and Serving on the Program Steering Committee: Understanding:  The Program Steering Committee will be responsible for the guidance and support of the Fellowship Program. Specific AAMC/ASPH Tasks:  AAMC and ASPH will have equal representation on the Steering Committee and attend all Steering Committee meetings.  Specific Fogarty International Center Tasks:  FIC will have the responsibility of initially forming the Steering Committee, managing its communications and determining its meeting schedule.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-138 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) to procure from Illumia Inc, 9390 Towne Center Drive, Suite 200, San Diego, CA 92121.  WG-30-503: Infinium Human Hap 550 Whole-Genome Genotyping Kit.  Each Sentrix Human Hap550 Genotyping BeadChip can process one sample and genotype > 550,000 local.  Each package contains ninety-six BeadChips, along with reagents for amplifying, fragmenting, hybridizing, labeling and detecting twenty-four whole-genome genotyping samples. The reagents are required for performing a whole genome association study in a Native American population. Infinium arrays are compatible with the Illumina Beadstation already installed in the LNG laboratory. To the best of our knowledge no other manufacturer produces a genotyping array that is compatible with this hardware, which requires us to obtain arrays directly from Illumina.  The Illumina reagent chemistry is preferred because the chemistry is compatible with the TECAN liquid handling robot currently in use in the laboratory. Use of Illumina arrays allows the experiment to be performed by LNG. The absence of suitable hardware for both running the arrays and scanning them would require that the arrays be run at another facility which increases the actual cost per chip. The Illumina 550K Whole Genome chip hip represents highest SNP density currently available and utilizes a haplotype maximization approach to SNP selection. Other vendors use a random SNP utilization approach to SNP selection and although using a similar number of SNP assays is unable to capture an equivalent amount of genetic information to the Illumina 550K array.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate additional clauses, provide a summary response to all questions, and to change the response date to 14 Jan 2007, 400 PM EST.  FDA-SOL-0700148(a) is a reposting of FDA SOL-07-00148 that due to a date problem was inadvertently archived in FBO.  FDA-SOL-07-00148(a) recreated the initial posting and responded to questions submitted for FDA-SOL-07-00148.

This amendment responds to the most recent questions and includes questions / responses submitted earlier.

(1) QUESTION:  What is the  minimum level of clearance that you require?  That is, do you require "Confidential" or "Secret" or "Top Secret" or some other classification entitled ____________________?
 
RESPONSE:  The categories  "Confidential" or "Secret" or "Top Secret" refer to DOD / Militatry security classifications.  The FDA uses "Personnel Security Requirements" and does not use the DOD classifications.  Clearances are usually held by those having Individuals who have undergone fingerprinting and had a successful a background investigation conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The FDA background investigation policy applies to all positions including: 

Students, Interns, Contractors,, Guest Workers, Visiting Scientists, Visiting Associate, Temporary Employees, Special Government Employees and Volunteers. 

You can find out more information on clearance requirements / security forms(SF 85 and SF 85P) on the link below.

www.opm.gov/forms

(2) QUESTION:  Even though it has been published, FAC 2005-15 is not effective until February 12, 2007.  Do you require it now nevertheless
RESPONSE:  Yes. Feb 1 07 was the anticipated award date.  However, the solicitation indicated that the dates could change.  The anticipated award date is mid-late February.

(3) QUESTION:   The questions and answers posted on January 8, 2007 state that you'll be amending the solicitation.  When will you actually be amending the solicitation and what will the new closing date be?
RESPONSE:
On Mon 1/8/2007 12:25PM, a memo was sent to all respondednts indicating that the original solicitation FDA-SOL-07-00148 had been accidentally archived.  the same memo responded to all questions and provided FDA-SOL-07-00148 (a) as the new solicitation posted on FBO.  Additionally, FDA-SOL-07-00148(a) indicated that it's intent was to respond to all questions and act as an amendment to FDA-SOL-07-00148.  Additionally, this amendment dated 11 Jan 07 incorporates all changes, clause updates and responds to all questions submitted.  The response date has been changed to 14 Jan 04, 4:00PM EST.

The date for submitting questions has passed.

Earlier Questions / Responses:

Is there was an incumbent.
Response:  Yes

Contractors name:
Response:  J. Dawson

Contract number:  
Response:  HHSF223200530231P

Date, expiration date and value. 
Response:  Effective date 7/13/2005 to present
Value: $61,950

Additional questions / responses:

 (1)  Under the heading "Qualifications," the solicitation requires "Current and Active Clearance to see confidential and proprietary information."
 
By this, do you mean that the person performing the work must possess a U.S. Government security clearance (i.e., either Confidential, Secret or Top Secret) OR do you mean that the person must simply possess a demonstrated ability to see, handle, process and protect confidential and proprietary business information, but not possess a formal government security clearance?
 
Response:  the individual performing the work must have a current and valid clearance from a Federal Government agency.


(2)  Do you require the CONTRACTOR (i.e., the firm to which you make the award) to also have whatever the above qualification is, or is your requirement sufficiently satisfied if the person actually doing the work has it?     
 
Response:  Only the individual performing the work is required to have the specified qualifications and  clearance.

(3)  The solicitation states that the incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12, dated Aug. 4, 2006.  There have been two additional FAC's, numbered 2005-13 and 2005-14, which were effective on September 28, 2006 and November 22, 2006, respectively.  
 
Will you amend the solicitation to incorporate these last two FAC's, or should these two simply be disregarded?

Response:  The solicitation will be amended to include the latest FACs through 2005-15 dated Dec 12, 2006.  The amendment will also include the following Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulations ( 48CFR, Vol71, No. 244) as published in the Federal Register Dec 20, 2006.
 
Department of Healt and Human Services
Subpart 353.2 ? Provisions and Clauses

Sec.
   352.202-1 	Definitions. ( Jan 2006)
   352.215-1 	Instructions to offerors--Competitive acquisition.
   352.215-70 	Late proposals and revisions. (Jan 2006)
   352.224-70 	Confidentiality of information.  
   352.232-9 	Withholding of contract payments.  (Jan 2006) 
   352.249-14 	Excusable delays. (Jan 2006)
    352.270-5 	Key personnel.
    352.270-11  Privacy Act (Jan 2006)
352.270-13	Tobacco Free Facilities (Jan 2006)
   

(4) The solicitation includes FAR clause 52.216-22, but it doesn't state an estimated level of effort for this indefinite quantity contract (so that adequate planning for dedicated staff can be made) or any minimum and maximum quantities.
 
Thus, what is the estimated number of labor hours contemplated by your requirement for a particular period (i.e., for the base year of seven months and for each of the two one-year options of twelve months each)?
 
Is there a minimum and maximum?

Response:   

The workload here is variable so setting the min/max would be difficult.  The contractor would have the ability to say he/she/they are too busy to take on a particular review assignment.  There may be other times when there is no work for a short period.  It depends on what documents are submitted to the Agency for review.  What we'd like to know from respondents is what they would propose as the hourly rate, which would be doing the work and what they would see as the level of effort along with any restrictions.  In the previous contracts,  16 hours per week was used as the proposed aggregate level of effort. 


Consequently, there is no definitive estimate available for the quantity of services to be performed under this contract.  Delivery and performance will be done at the direction of the Project Officer.  There is no minimum or maximum.  Once a contractor is selected, a purchase order specifying a not to exceed amount will be issued to the contractor.
 
(5) The solicitation includes FAR clause 52.217-9.  There are several places in that clause for entries by the government.  
 
Can you advise as to what these entries should be in the clause's paras. (a) and (c)?
 
Response: (a)  30 days;  30 days:  (c) 2 years 7 months ( Base period of 7 months and 2 option years).
