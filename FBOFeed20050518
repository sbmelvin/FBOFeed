<DESC>The USGS Western Remote Sensing and Visualization team in Sacramento, CA requires Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) imagery to assess the impact of human induced land surface deformation on aquifer storage, land subsidence and seismic hazards assessments.  This work addresses a FY04 congressional directive for the "acquisition of the InSAR satellite data to be used to provide essential ground based monitoring and InSAR research and development". The U.S. Geological Survey intends to award a noncompetitive procurement to the European Space Agency (ESA) of Franscati, Italy IAW FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  The European Space Agency owns and operates the ERS-1, ERS-2, and Envisat C-band radar satellites.  No other agency (or country, including the United States), has operational radar satellites with tight orbit control such that radar interferograms can be produced on a regular basis and that have an archive that dates back to 1992.  Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these data shall submit a capabilities statement to the contracting officer no later than the closing date of this announcement at 17:00 local time.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist; if no submissions are received, the Government will proceed with noncompetitive award without further notice.  This is NOT a Request for Quotation (RFQ); the Government does not anticipate issuing a written solicitation. This notice and any resulting contract or order conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-03, dated 11 April 2005.  No numbered notes apply. For further information, please contact Jeff Caravelli, Contracting Officer, at (916) 278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov.

<DESC>A) Overview

The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) requires contract personnel to support the Test, Evaluation & Quality (TE&Q) organization by performing a variety of Quality Assurance (QA) related functions in support of Technology Acquisition Management (TAM) and other Engineering.  The services required deal primarily with experienced technical and management specialists who are capable of implementing field acceptance testing of mail processing equipment and performing quality audits.

Currently TE&Q uses approximately 110 contract persons in several labor categories, funded by over 30 different financial accounts, and it is anticipated that these figures will remain viable for the duration of the initial contract term.  However, the USPS may increase or decrease the number of contract personnel at any time, and there is no guaranteed minimum number of contract employees that must be maintained.

Approximately 15% of all contract employees are domiciled at the Engineering offices in Merrifield, VA or some specific supplier’s facility.  Of all the contract employees approximately 90% travel extensively throughout the United States.  Some assignments may require less or more than 40 hours per week.  A five-day workweek is not contemplated for most assignments.  No minimum workweek is guaranteed.  At the option of the USPS, a minimum of four (4) hours may be provided for Nonresident contract person on a case by case basis when traveling to a Postal site for a field test that is unexpectedly cancelled, rescheduled or postponed.

The supplier must be able to perform recruiting, managing, invoicing, and reporting tasks as a minimum.  Training shall be provided as necessary by the supplier in order to meet and maintain personnel requirements.  Certain equipment and supplies must also be provided and maintained as specified in this SOW and subsequent Task Orders.

B)  Required Supplier Criteria and Other Information

The USPS intends to pre-qualify respondents capable of providing an innovative and commercially available technical staffing and management services. Respondents included in any subsequent pre-qualified group may be invited to participate in follow-up pre-qualification processes, a discovery process, Reverse Auction or to provide proposals in response to the USPS Request for Proposal.  However, the USPS reserves the right to terminate this process if it is deemed that the availability or maturity of the commercial solutions does not fit the current need or vision of the USPS.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USPS activities. The USPS may make one or more awards to support this activity.

C)  Selection Process

The USPS decision to pre-qualify respondents is a business decision of the USPS Purchasing team.  Pre-qualification does not constitute an award.  Pre-qualification will be based on a composite of all responses, not any single item, that demonstrate a respondent’s capability to provide an innovative and commercially available technical and management services.  All qualified respondents may not be placed in the pre-qualified group if the purchase team determines that a smaller group may provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for others less qualified.  Respondents whose responses to this notice indicate that their solution is (1) not commercially available, (2) beyond the current or immediate experience level or resources of their firm, or (3) deemed unrealistically incompatible with the USPS environment and vision, may not be considered for pre-qualification.

Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) to award additional effort on a single source basis to The Boeing Company of Seattle, Washington, under existing contract DTFACT-03-C-00O33. The effort proposed under Phase 3 is a continuation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 effort completed under contracts DTFA03-01-C-00032 (Indications of Propulsion System Malfunctions) and DTFACT-03-C-00033 (Improved PSM Detection and Annunciation for Reduction of ICR) respectively.  Due to the Boeing Company's completion of Phase 1 and 2 already, and the proprietarty data that is essential for performing this effort, The Boeing Company is the only contractor capable of completing Phase 3 of this effort. Boeing has proprietary, industry sensitive, in-service incident data that is unavailable to other contractors.  The Boeing Company also has unique expertise to interpret the proprietary data and unique expertise on the aircraft systems used to collect the data. Contract DTFACT-03-C-00O33 will be modified to support this effort on a firm fixed-price basis for an additional eighteen (18) month time period. A competitive solicitation is unavailable for this effort due to the proprietary nature of the data being utilized and the unique expertise of The Boeing Company to continue this effort. If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing the above services and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.  Any inquiries/questions regarding this announcement should be directed to Chris Gallagher, Contracting Officer, e-mail (see above).

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to place a single source award with Microsoft Corporation for Premier Support Services, Level C, to assist in maintaining existing Microsoft software.  The requirement is for the base year plus four one-year options to renew.  Microsoft Corporation is the only known source having possession of the required technical expertise and knowledge that are necessary to accomplish the work.  This is a follow-on requirement that has previously been awarded to Microsoft on a yearly basis.  The FAA reserves the right to award the first performance year in time to ensure that there is no break in service while evaluating any new information developed as a result of this announcement that could affect the decision on whether to exercise the options. This notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises:  DOT, Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (SADBU), has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.  Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing.  The maximum line of credit is $500,000.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences intends to award a sole source purchase order to Biorad Laboratories, Richmond, CA 94804, pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This procurement is for two (2) Thermocycler Tetrad TPC-225; eight (8) Alpha, Engine 96V-Well; two (2) Powerpac Basic Powersupplies; and one (1) Mini-Sub Cell GT System; two (2) Sub-Cell GT Systems; two (21) Sub-Cell GT Gel Casting Gates; four (4) GT UVTP Gel Trays; one (1) Wide Mini-Sub Cell GT System; 15 MP Comb, 26 Well, 1.5 MM thick; two (2) GT Mini-Comb, 15 Well, 1.5MM thick; and two (2) Mini-Comb, 8 well, 1.5MM thick.  Researchers have been using the Biorad Tetrad Thermocyclers because they are the only 4-unit machines in this market.  Researchers perform high-throughput analyses and must have multi-unit machines.  All the protocols are designed for the Biorad Tetrad cycling parameters, and changing brands would disrupt ongoing research and possibly yield results that are inconsistent with previous studies.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of date of notice to Elaine W. Shoaf at the above address for consideration by the agency.  Faxed responses will be accepted at 919 541-5117.   Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Biorad Laboratories.  The NAICS code/size is 334516/500 employees.  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  There is no solicitation package available.

<ARCHDATE>07022005
<CONTACT>Hugh Harrison 301-227-1123
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, (NSWCCD) intends to award a Sole Source purchase order to Rutgers University. Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey (Piscataway, NJ 08854) shall develop a high-power energy storage technology for the high power section of a zinc-air hybrid power supply.  It will enable the system to provide 100 watts, one (1) minute pulse for thousands of cycles. The resulting purchase order will be a firm fixed price purchase order. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541710 and has a employee standard of  500. The nature of the high-power energy storage technology being developed at Rutgers University employs a nanostructured lithium titanate electrode.  This material displays unique characteristics that will potentially meet the Marine Corp’s power and cycle life requirements for communication electronics such as the Single Channel Ground Air Radio System (SINGARS) radio. D! r. Glenn Amatucci of Rutgers is an inventor of the lithium titanate/carbon asymmetric capacitor.  He has also shown how substitution of the carbon in one of the electrodes with transition metal oxide materials can significantly improve energy density.  He has demonstrated this improvement in hardware fitting the dimensions of the SINGARS high power unit.   Dr. Amatucci and coworkers have over five years’ hands on-experience in developing and advancing lithium titanate energy storage devices.  During this time, they have been awarded several patents on this technology. Because of this experience and intimate knowledge Dr. Amatucci is uniquely qualified to perform the required tasking.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. Responses can be forwarded to the POC, Hugh Harrison by fax: (301)227-1847; or by email: harrisonhl@nswccd.navy.mil.

Using high temperature                           tape, tape the thermocouple sensor to the inside of the duct cavity that approximates the location of the                           thermostat.                       5)  Place the heated duct in the oven, unheated, and feed the test cable and thermocouple sensor lead through                           the oven's feed through polls.                        6)  Connect the thermocouple sensor to the digital thermometer and turn it on. Set multimeter function to                            continuity check and audio to on.  Connect the multimeter to pin E - F of the test cable.  Verify that the                            circuit is not broken.  If the circuit is broken and the digital thermometer reads less than I 1 5 F, the                            thermostat is damaged.                            If circuit is broken, record temperature reading:.. OF                        7)  Turn the oven on and set the temperature to 145' F with a heat up rate of 4' F per minute.                        8)  Monitor the digital thermometer and multimeter as the oven is being heated. Record the temperature                            reading when the multimeter indicates that the circuit is broken (thermostat at the open position).  If the                            circuit is not broken after the temperature reaches 145' F, let the heated duct soak at 145' F for                            approximately 15 minutes.  If the circuit is not broken after a 15 minute soak time, the thermostat had failed                            to function.                            Actual temperature at which the circuit is broken:              OF                            Required temperature at whi,,h the circuit is broken: I 1 5 - 145 OF                        9)  Set the oven temperature to @',5' F from 145' F at a cooling rate of 4 F per minute.                        10) Monitor the digital thermometer and multimeter as the oven is being cooled. Record the temperature                            reading when the multimeter indicates that the circuit is continuous (thermostat at the close position).  If the                            circuit is not continuous aftei.- the temperature reaches 85' F, let the heated duct soak at 85 F for                            approximately 15 minutes.  If the circuit is not continuous after a 15 minute soak time, then the thermostat                            had failed to function.                            Record Actual temperature at which the circuit is continuous:              OF                            Required temperature at whi,,-h the circuit is continuous: 85 - 115 OF                   Evaluator:-                    Date:                   Purchase Number:                  PACKAGING:                  All material to be delivered under this contract/order is to be packaged in accordance with                  ASTM D3951-90, Commercial Packaging.

<DESC>SSA-RFP-05-1028: TV STUDIO UPGRADE TO HD. SSA has an onsite full performance Television Studio.  The technology is outdated and potentially obsolete with the nationally mandated conversion to HDTV. SSA has seeks to upgrade the existing SDI equipment to the HD SDI standard. This approach provides the most cost-effective solution maximizing the investment in existing production and postproduction systems. However, the majority of existing SDI equipment is not upgradeable to the new HD SDI standard and will need to be replaced. SSA’s plan for up-grading the existing plant from SD SDI to HD SDI capability presents the same challenges faced by many industry wide broadcast professionals as considerations are given to how to achieve transition from SD to HD in a reasonable manor without disposing of the existing investment made in SD digital television equipment. A hybrid approach to the problem offers to be the best short to mid-term solution allowing reasonable service life of existing SD equipment while transitioning over time to a total HD SDI environment. Items to be addressed are (1) The determination of which HDTV camera system is selected establishes the overall signal quality and performance standards for the entire HDTV system. (2) The selection of a master HDTV recording format is the second most important decision faced. (3) The third most important technical consideration is the production switcher, signal processing, distribution and routing systems. (4) The selection of an HDTV non-linear post-production edit system is the next most important decision affecting the quality of the final product. Additionally, the selected contractor will provide on-Site training on Equipment/Software provided under the contract, on-site Program/Engineering support, Hardware Maintenance and Software Maintenance with telephone support and other services as necessary for the ongoing project. SSA is seeking a Small Business vendor who will assess the SSA studio’s needs, provide engineering support for the upgrade, provide and maintain the new equipment (hardware and software) and recommend steps for future upgrades. This requirement is a TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE UNDER NAICS CODE 511199. The contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, materials, services and equipment described in the Solicitation when issued.  The contract will be a Fixed Price Requirements type with a Base Year and up to four One Year Options.  SSA anticipates the upgrade to HD will be done incrementally.  Any qualified Small Business firm which believes it has the Technical Capabilities and the Relevant Experience to perform the described tasks should read the solicitation when issued. Teaming arrangements are welcome.  The solicitation will be available on the FEDBIZOPPS WEB Site (www2.eps.gov) on or about March 30, 2005 with proposals due on or about April 29, 2005.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This modifies the subject solicitation DG1330-05-RP-1070 issued on April 28, 2005, synopsized previously under DG1330-05-RP-1057.  

The modification is necessary due to a need to restructure the statement of work as written to delete any work related to distribution, locator and duplicating services. The distribution, locator and duplicating services will be solicited by the Government Printing Office (GPO) as a separate contract.  At this time, we plan to modify the present solicitation to remove the distribution, locator and duplicating services to be procured through GPO from the statement of work. A modification to the solicitation will be issued within 2-3 weeks. The present proposal due dates are hereby suspended and a new proposal due date will be established in the next modification when it is issued. All questions concerning the solicitation that have been submitted previously will be retained and addressed in the next modification to the solicitation to be issued. The Government anticipates a new contract start date of October 1, 2005.   


The modification to solicitation will be posted to the fedbizopps web site when available. NOAA wants to assure all potential offerors that this acquisition is still a competitive 8(a) procurement and the only reasons for the delay is due to the facts stated above.

Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

<CONTACT>Deborah Green, Contract Specialist, Phone 805-982-2680, Fax 805-982-4540, Email deborah.green@navy.mil
<DESC>The Geothermal Program Office (GPO) of the U.S. Navy is seeking an independent analysis of the hydrogeology of the area known as the Coso Hot Springs, located in the Coso Range, Naval Air Weapons Station, China Lake, CA.  The Coso Geothermal Area has been the subject of both occasional and intensive study over the past 90 years, but no compelling hydrogeologic model has emerged that clearly explains the relationship between major surface thermal features and the deep geothermal resource that is being used to generate electricity in nearby power plants.  Specifically the study shall describe any influence on Coso Hot Springs from activities related to geothermal power production in the adjacent Coso Geothermal Field.  The work performed under this contract will attempt to provide a comprehensive model that: explains the occurrence and movement of subterranean waters; the mechanical, chemical, and thermal interaction of this water with the porous and permeable medium; and the transport of energy and chemical constituents related thereto.  As described in the edited list of relevant publications provided in this solicitation, there are numerous data sets available for the area including more than 20 years of monitoring reports, compiled and interpreted by personnel of the U.S. Navy Geothermal Program Office, its contractors, and independent scientific investigators.  These resources will be made available to the successful offeror to utilize in completing the work.  The study must address all aspects of the Coso Range hydrologic environment including the non-geothermal, high-desert hydrogeology, both shallow local and deep regional hydrology, as well as the geothermal elements of the overlying Coso geothermal field.  As appropriate, and required to, acknowledge the importance of the neotectonic setting in which the Coso Hot Springs is located, the proposal shall incorporate known structural and tectonic findings into the hydrogeology model.  This study must be completed in one year or less from date of contract award, and the required products will be: (1) A technical report fully documenting the detailed hydrogeologic model as well as all analyses, syntheses, assumptions and processes that contributed to the model.  (2) A less-technically oriented summary report that shall be written and illustrated such that the scientific processes, modeling and conclusions of the study can be readily understood by the general public.

<DESC>Modification of synopsis Reference Number GSEDS-EXT-5-11-05.  The synopsis posting date of 5-11-05 is unchanged.  The words at the end of the first sentence,  "until a new contract is awarded" are changed to:  until a follow on acquisition strategy is formalized.  NOAA will be issuing additional FedBizOps announcements regarding this requirement in the near future.  ----ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS:----

This synopsis provides notice that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to extend their current contract with Harris Corporation, Harris Technical Service Corporation, for the continued support of the Ground Systems Engineering and Depot Support contract, until a new contract is awarded.  This interim extension will provide the continuation of services and support now provided to NOAA and the Department of Defense (DOD) by the contractor. The extension is planned for nine months at $3M.  The contract entails, in part, system engineering and maintenance, most recently upgrades to obsolete legacy equipment, ground support, hardware support and software support, including component supply, repair, testing, maintenance, upgrades, and other technical support of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and the Windsat-Coriolis satellite.  The DMSP satellites collect and disseminate global visible and infrared cloud data in support of worldwide operations and high priority programs.  The global data must be provided in a timely manner to users at the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) and Fleet Numerical Meteorological Operations Center (FNMOC).  Each DMSP satellite has a 101 minute, sun-synchronous near-polar orbit at an altitude of 830km above the surface of the earth. The visible and infrared sensors (OLS) collect images across a 3000km swath, providing global coverage twice per day. The combination of day/night and dawn/dusk satellites allows monitoring of global information such as clouds every 6 hours. The microwave imager (MI) and sounders (T1, T2) cover one half the width of the visible and infrared swath. These instruments cover polar regions at least twice and the equatorial region once per day. The space environment sensors (J4, M, IES) record along-track plasma densities, velocities, composition and drifts. There are currently 6 operational DMSP satellites on orbit.  The DMSP ground system network is an earth based command, telemetry, and data processing system providing all functions for the state of health maintenance, communications, sensor payload data retrieval and dissemination, and launch and early orbit support for the DMSP constellation. The ground segment consists of the Suitland Operations Control Center (SOCC), Suitland, MD; Environmental Satellite Operations Center (ESOC), Schriever AFB, CO; the Payload Integration Test Facility (PITF), Vandenberg AFB, CA; AFSCN tracking stations at Hawaii, Thule Greenland, New Boston, NH; NOAA tracking stations in Fairbanks, AK, and Wallops, VA; user sites at AFWA, Omaha, NE, and FNMOC, at Monterey, CA.  Other operational support nodes include Onizuka AFB, CA and the DMSP SPO at Los Angeles AFB, CA.  Future operational nodes may include McMurdo Ground Station, Antarctica, and the Svalsat Ground Station in Svalbard, Norway.  The Government requires Level 1, 2, and 3 for depot level support on all operational and spare hardware.  The Government requires a ground segment mission reliability of 99.8%.  The ground segment operational availability rate will be 99.7% with a mean time between critical failures of the ground segment greater than 328 hours.  The mean time to repair the ground segment is less than 1 hour and the maximum corrective maintenance time of all repair actions does not exceed 3 hours.  SERVICES INFORMATION  Required services include technical support to all DMSP equipment at any site.  Technical support includes development, integration, and preventive and corrective maintenance. DMSP requires supply storage at the Contractor depot location for all depot items.  The Contractor furnishes all facilities, parts, materials, data, equipment and services.  In order to meet the timely data delivery requirements, the Program requires on-call emergency technical support to any DMSP ground segment site, system engineering and analysis of ground segment equipment, configuration management, and feasibility studies for system enhancements and modifications.   The Program also requires sustaining engineering, system performance analysis, and test support.  Because of the use of legacy equipment, component and operational system modifications are required.  Modifications include design, develop, fabricate, test, produce, manufacture, install modification kits and update all required technical documentation.  Support for the DMSP ground segment include interaction and in-depth knowledge of the AFSCN, access to AFSCN sites, and support at AFSCN technical meetings.  DMSP support includes launch and early orbit support for DMSP spacecraft, providing ground system expertise and on-site support to the operations command center in Suitland, MD.  Interaction with Government and other contractors, as well as independent work, for launch and early orbit anomaly resolution related to the DMSP ground system is required.  A SECRET clearance is necessary for this effort.  Engineering labor categories include software, system, mechanical, electrical, manufacturing, and quality assurance.  Other labor categories may include scientist, program management, administrative, and logistics.  Interested persons may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement within 15 days of this notice.

Of particular interest are the following: •	The type of sensor that might be combined with an RFID transponder, (temperature,        strain, radiation, etc) and its principle of operation (resistive, capacitive, etc) •	Whether the transponder and sensor have to be manufactured as a pair or a sensor can be added to an already existing transponder. •	The number of bits of resolution of the measure and that could be transmitted •	The size and weight of the sensor-transponder pair, and of the reader •	The amount of power consumed by the transponder, if any, and by the reader. •	The distance at which the reader can receive information from the transponder, and the extent to which the distance is reduced or the signal corrupted by external factors such as RF fields, dust, or radiation •	The operating temperature of the transponder and reader Businesses making equipment described above should provide information on its capabilities in response to this request.  The information will be used for planning purposes and developing Government requirements and may result in a future purchase.  This Request for Information is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information provided.  Comments may be forwarded to Gustave C. Fralick at Gustave.C.Fralick@nasa.gov via electronic transmission. This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.

<SUBJECT>20 -- Notice of intent to procure on a sole source basis
<DESC>Notice of intent to procure on a sole source basis an Applanix POS MV upgrade to V-4 system and related component parts.  The Applanix systems are currently installed on the NOAA fleet, upgrade to this system is proprietary and as such the upgrades can only be completed solely by the manufacturer, Applanix.  If this exact unit is not installed and the primary attitude sensor fails, the multibeam sonar that is used to map the coral reef will be unusable and the ship will have to return to port.  Therefore it is in the government’s opinion that Applanix is the only responsible vendor.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.

<DESC>Notice of intent to procure on a sole source basis an EK 60 Scientif Sounder Gpt-38 kHz split bean operation from Simrad, Inc.  For the 2005 US-Canada Pacific Hake Echo Integration-Trawl (EIT) Survey we require a spare SIMRAD EK60 General Purpose Transducer (GPT) for an existing SIMRAD EK60 Scientific Echo Sounder.  The EK 60 system is the industry standard for scientific echo sounders and used by all NOAA fisheries acoustics groups.  NOAA currently owns an EK 60 system and this 38-kHz GPT is an exact replacement part in the event of an equipment failure during the survey.  Therefore it is the government’s opinion that no other GPT supplier is acceptable for this purpose.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.

Past Performance Evaluation Criterion: The following factor will be considered in evaluating the offeror’s past performance: demonstrated record (as confirmed by references) of successful past performance of the same or similar projects of this scope on time within budget.

Discounts from the contractor’s catalog or market publication prices must be clearly stated.  The Government reserves the right to reject an offer in the event that the lack of balance in the pricing poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.  Proposed pricing will be evaluated to determine whether they are necessary and reasonable for the conduct of the proposed future delivery orders or purchase card orders, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the methods of performance described in the offeror’s proposal.  Price proposals will not be compared against each firm to determine the best price.  Best value, in regards to superior technical proposals, will determine at what proposed and realistic cost will TSA award the contractor.

<DESC>Amendment 1 adds one additional mandatory requirement and provides answers to questions received by offerors

Additional Mandatory Requirement:  Provide number of square feet for all proposed rooms.


Question 1 How many times a day will transportation services be needed?

Response 1  Transportation from lodging facility to Peace Corps HQ twice per day (am and pm) and regular (please quantify) service from lodging facility to local Metro station.  Transportation to local grocery story three to five times weekly is preferred.  Transportation from lodging facility to Airport(s) is no longer a mandatory requirement of this solicitation.  It is now a preferred requirement.  Offerors should specify if they are able to provide transportation to Reagan National Airport once per day, if necessary.  Offerors are directed to quantify transportation schedules in their responses.


Question 2 What kind of transportation is needed? Is this restricted to bus service, or can there be other options available?
 
Response 2 Other options may be proposed, such as a smaller vehicle than shuttle bus.  Any proposal that meets or exceeds the requirements will be considered as long as it represents best value to the government.  


Question 3 If the lodging is near a metro station, will transportation services (i.e. Bus service) be needed to the Peace Corps offices? 

Response 3 Transportation services as outlined in the rfp are a mandatory requirement.  Some peace corps volunteers may have a physical condition that makes metro impractical.


Question 4 What are the airport transportation needs; for individuals or for groups?
 
Response 4 Airport transportation is no longer a mandatory requirement.  It is now an optional requirement.  Airport transportation would be for individuals.  


Question 5 I see the Naics code is Hotels. Are you only looking for hotels? We are a 3rd party housing provider. We don't own any buildings we actually sublease in existing apartments and offer to the customer a FULLY FURNISHED apartment.

Response 5 Any type of lodging facility, including furnished apartments, that meets or exceeds the requirements will be considered as long as it represents best value to the government.


Question 6 How often do you need maid service? How often will the people change in the rooms/apartments? DO the people stay for 30 days at a time? What is the turnover?

Response 6 Maid service is required at least 2 times per week, and required before every new Volunteer check in.  Volunteers stay will vary due to medical conditions from a few days to a maximum of 45 days.  The average is 30 days per volunteer.


Question 7 In years past where has the Peace Corp Medevac been housed? What was the daily rate that you paid? Any history would be great to know?
 
Response 7 Virginian Suites is the incumbent.  Any further information will only be released through a freedom of information act request.

Question 8 You mentioned 13 rooms to start on 10/1-Do they all have to be in the
Same building or can the rooms be split between 2 locations? 

Response 8 The solicitation specifies not thirteen (13), but TWELVE (12) rooms by number, for the exclusive use of Peace Corps.  Rooms are to be in the same lodging facility.


Question 9 Are these 1 year leases that you are looking to sign? Do you still pay
For 13 rooms even if you are using only 10?
 
Response 9 The solicitation specifies TWELVE (12) rooms, by number for the exclusive use of Peace Corps for a one year base contract with four option years. The Peace Corps pays for all contracted rooms regardless of their occupancy.
 
Question 10 It states that if you need additional rooms you only need to provide a
24 hour notice.  Does it have to be the same property? Do we have to honor
The contract rate?

Response 10 When the Peace Corps needs extra rooms and the facility has extra rooms available, the facility will provide rooms at the contracted rate. 

Question 11 Has the Peace Corps had this program before and was the location in the past, a hotel or apartment community?

Response 11 This program is over 5 years old.  The Incumbent was Virginian Suites, a limited service all suite hotel, in Rosslyn VA..

NOTE Any questions to Contracting Officer must be in writing.

<DESC>This purpose of this amendment is to: (1)Post the questions and answers to the combined synopsis/solicitation and (2) To change the due date of proposals from May 16, 2005, 12:00 p.m., est to May 27, 2005, 12:00 p.m., est.

(1) Questions and Answers:

1. To what extend will our own editorial team be involved with the creation of content and pre-work? 

I would like the contractor to be involved before the workshop with selecting invitees and persuading them to attend; after the workshop with summarizing the meeting discussion for publication on its website and in print media.

2. Will CDRH attendees incur reimbursable expenses? 

Yes, but I think the contractor is not allowed to pay for the expenses of CDRH attendees.  Since the CDRH components have to pay, the costs for them will need to be low -- hence, the meeting ought to be in the DC area.

3. Is there a standard format document for information?

No , the combined synopsis/solicitation does not specify a format.

4. Is there a filed out Form 1449 from the grantor?  Please send path or document.  Can a word document be used and what format?

Go online to fedforms.gov to download a copy of  SF1449

(2) All proposals are due on May 27, 2005 @ 12:00 est.
