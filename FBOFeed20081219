<DESC>NAICS Code: 811219   The US EPA/OCEFT National Enforcement Investigations Center (NEIC), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to PerkinElmer LAS, Inc. of Shelton, CT for a serviceagreement for (5) instrument systems, including: (2) Optima ICP-OES instrument systems, an Elan6000 ICP-MS instrument system, an Elan DRCII ICP-MS instrument system and an AAnalyst800 instrument system.  The agreement will be in place from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009.  The justification is as follows.  As the manufacturer of the instruments, only PerkinElmer has the specific instrumentation knowledge, software expertise and service engineer training required to properly maintain these instruments.   For example, PerkinElmer service engineers have access to "service data bulletins" issued by PerkinElmer that describe issues with their instrumentation.  PerkinElmer also has design engineers and application specialists available to assist the service engineers when problems arise.  Furthermore, PerkinElmer would be able to provide "loaner" instruments if factory repair was required.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the contracting officer at daniels.ryan@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC>The Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation of Huntsville, Alabama to develop technology enhancement for improved, affordable systems, subsystems, and components for the Manufacturing Process Technologies for Hawk Variants and other Rotary Wing Systems program.  The proposed acquisition is direct to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Any source other than Sikorsky would require substantial duplication of time and cost to the Government, neither of which would be recovered through the additional competition, and unacceptable delay would also be incurred in fulfilling the Governments requirement.

The period of performance will consist of five-years from date of award.  The following details the description of Manufacturing Process Technologies for Hawk Variants and other Rotary Wing Systems program:<BR><BR>A.	The Manufacturing Process Technologies for Black Hawk Helicopter effort will provide the unique technical capabilities required to support manufacturing and machining mission requirements that cannot be supported by any other means.  <BR><BR>The Manufacturing Process Technologies for Black Hawk Helicopter program will serve the DOD and other federal agencies through support of the Hawk family of aircraft by focusing on the following areas:  <BR><BR>1) Emerging manufacturing processes, methods, techniques, equipment, tools, fixtures, inspection, testing, design, analysis and technologies required to support fabrication, maintenance, operation or support of helicopter structural and non-structural airframe and non-airframe components of the Black Hawk aircraft or associated aviation ground support equipment (AGSE). <BR><BR>2) Emerging manufacturing methods impacting and lowering acquisition and operations and support (O&S) costs, providing increased operational performance, adding additional capabilities and/or increasing the potential to meet mission or operational objectives. <BR><BR>3) Emerging manufacturing technologies impacting and improving reliability, availability, maintainability, supportability, transportability, survivability, safety, fuel efficiency, and environmental characteristics. <BR><BR>4) Emerging manufacturing qualification test phase and/or production insertion, if required, will vary depending on the requirements of the funding source and customer needs.<BR><BR>B.	A five-year program is envisioned for achieving the objectives of the initiative.  Types of efforts will include 1) research and development, 2) prototype development and fabrication, 3) demonstration/validation of applicable technology (including installation and testing), 4) product development and services, 5) product application studies and modeling, 6) fabrication/production of hardware, 7) software design, development, and fabrication, 8) retrofitting developed products into existing platforms.  It is anticipated to have at least seven, one year projects from each of these efforts.  Within these efforts will be the task of selecting candidate projects with a goal of selecting thirty-seven projects over a five year period.  After project selection, process technologies will be utilized in an effort to reduce cost, shorten lead-times and/or enhance durability and extend service life.  Production of test assets may be done in order to validate any new manufacturing processes.  During this effort, any technologies developed will be applied and modified for application to critical assemblies and subsystems.  This effort will also focus on transitioning the process technologies developed to industrial practice to provide an industrial infrastructure to support Army Aviation needs.  <BR><BR>Based upon market research, the Government is using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

BALMACEDA AIRPORT MODERNIZATION MASTER PLAN PROJECT.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study aimed at assessing the technical and financial viability of expanding and modernizing the Balmaceda airport.  The study will provide an implementation plan to expand existing infrastructure and redesign terminal areas in order to accommodate current and forecasted passenger and cargo demand and allow the operation of larger type aircraft.

Among the broad objectives of the Master Plan are:
	A demand-capacity analysis to assess development requirements based on projected air traffic demand; 
	A development plan that identifies and prioritizes investments for the short, medium and long terms; 
	A financial plan to finance the proposed improvements and recommend concession strategies/privatization options, if appropriate; and 
	An evaluation of environmental and developmental impacts associated with recommended projects. 

The Master Plan will also analyze the objectives of: designing a new parallel taxiway that can also be used as an alternate runway, expanding the current runway, relocating the existing passenger terminal to a new facility, modernizing the cargo terminal, installing new security and navigations systems, and upgrading the airport to meet Chilean and international standards.  In addition, the DAP seeks to evaluate the potential for airport privatization.  Chile has privatized most of the airports in the country and the DAP is extremely interested in evaluating potential privatization options for Balmaceda.

In addition, the Master Plan will serve as an investment promotion tool to attract private sector participation and create a roadmap of development for any potential future concessionaire.  The project will have significant social and economic impacts in the Aisn Region by providing increased accessibility to isolated areas and supporting trade.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $351,200 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to

This requirement includes, but is not limited to, education experts equipped to provide advice and facilitation on a range of topics such as leadership training and development, strategic thinking and planning, ethics, change management, supervisory training, critical thinking, management of human and other resources and senior executive coaching. The Government anticipates an award of an IDIQ contract with a base period of one year with 3-4 one year option periods.  Sources must also be able to provide lodging and meals to 20 - 30 participants at their facility based on the individual requirements for a specific training task. 

The scope of this requirement will encompass a cooperative relationship/ partnership with the Contractor that ranges from periodic informal discussions and information exchanges to more formal projects involving specific timeframes and deliverables mutually agreed upon by OTD and the Contractor.  The Contractor will possess extensive knowledge of, and experience with, designing curricula and providing instruction to federal law enforcement agents and officers, technical specialists in law enforcement-related disciplines, and administrators responsible for developing and regulating the budgetary, procurement, human resource and training and quantitative/qualitative analytical processes in a federal law enforcement organization.  The Contractor will provide academic expertise to ICE in a wide range of curriculum and instructor development programs designed to enhance the overall quality of law enforcement, managerial and leadership training provided by OTD. OTD and the Contractor will jointly develop specific educational offerings.

Contractor will provide consultation and expertise, and upon mutual agreement with OTD, execute various projects (given 45-60 days notice) customized to address ICE needs and issues including but not limited to:
	assessments and recommendations (including guidance in transitioning from instructor-led to student-centered training; developing knowledge and performance assessment tools; measuring training transfer and organizational impact of training)
	curriculum review and development  
	undergraduate and graduate courses and programs (both residential and online)
	non-credit leadership and strategic thinking programs (including Gettysburg staff rides)

<DESC>This is a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley ResearchCenter (LaRC) Request For Information (RFI). It is emphasized that the requestedinformation is for preliminary planning purposes only and does not constitute acommitment, implied or otherwise, that NASA will solicit for such procurement in thefuture. White papers in response to this notice will also verify reasonableness andfeasibility of future requirements and promote competition.  The Government is notresponsible for any costs incurred in furnishing this information. Respondents will notbe notified of the results of any government assessments.All information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended to be used by the Governmentfor program planning and acquisition strategy development.  As stipulated in FAR15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted bythe Government to form a binding contract.  If a solicitation is released in the future,it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. NASA is developing a proposal for the upcoming New Frontiers Program Announcement ofOpportunity.  The proposed mission aims to deliver an atmospheric probe to Venus.  A keycomponent to the success of the mission is the parachute subsystem.  It is desired thatthis subsystem have a strong heritage connection to the successful Pioneer Venus missionof the late 70s with material substitutions as appropriate (e.g. the use of Kevlarrather than Dacron).  The subsystem will consist of two basic groupings of components: amortar deployed pilot parachute for back shell separation and main parachute deployment;and a main parachute for heat shield separation and speed control. Back shell separationis to be initiated at 64.3 km altitude via firing of the mortar cartridge and deploymentof the ~0.75m ribless guide surface pilot parachute.  Deployment will occur at a MachNumber of 0.8 and the entry vehicle mass (back shell, probe, and heat shield) is 465 kg. A bridle assembly attached to the interior of the back shell in turn will extract themain parachute pack, strip the main parachute bag, and allow the ~5.0m conical ribbonmain parachute to inflate.  The mass of the probe is 335 kg and heat shield is 121 kg. The heat shield will be jettisoned approximately 5 seconds after main parachutedeployment.  The main parachute will be jettisoned after 45 minutes at an altitude of28.4 km.Requirements for the development of the parachute subsystem may include the following: 1. Sufficient ground testing to establish the function and reliability of the mortardeployment assembly. 2. Ground and flight testing to validate the strength and performance of the pilot andmain parachutes. 3. Appropriate flight tests to establish the function and reliability of the completeparachute subsystem (from mortar firing to post heat shield separation in one test) atrelevant conditions (Mach=0.8 and equivalent deployment initiation density). 4.  Appropriate documentation of the parachute subsystem including stress reports,performance reports, and mechanical interface engineering reports. 5.  It is anticipated that the requirements will include delivery of one flight readyunit to NASA for vehicle integration no earlier than September 1, 2015. RFI Requirements and Preparation of White Paper responses.  Interested parties shouldrespond with the following information: 1. General Description a. Physically describe the subsystem including mass and volume. b. Describe subsystem operation (e.g., how the subsystem is packaged and deployed). 2. Flight or Technology Heritage/Qualification a.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small businesses including 8(a), HUBZone, Women Owned Small business, Small disadvantaged Business, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business concerns that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. Teaming and partnering among small businesses is encouraged.

The NIA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses to this Sources Sought Notice, nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NIA may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NIA shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NIA's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.

If an RFP is issued, it is anticipated that one (1), cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a period of five (5) years with an option for yearly extensions up to two (2) additional years and/or additional quantities. This contract may include incentives, award fees, and/or be performance based. 

The National Institute of Aging (NIA) is seeking qualified small businesses to provide support to the Intramural Research Branch (IRB), of the National Institutes of Aging (NIA) within the NIH, to provide drug development and toxicology screening support as described below.

This is a re-competition of the current contract with SRI International, Inc. which ends in September, 2009. This is the third re-competition of this contract. 

Efforts in developing and testing new drugs for the prevention and treatment of the cognitive impairment and behavioral symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) represent a major programmatic activity of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) but continue to be hindered by the lack of access of many academic investigators and small businesses to animal testing facilities to evaluate the preclinical toxicology of potential therapeutics. The present paucity of compounds which can uniformly slow or reverse the progression of AD or ameliorate the symptoms or delay the onset requires that every effort be made to facilitate the development and testing of new compounds. The need to develop therapeutics for other aging-related diseases is also apparent. Additionally, the advent of Positron Emission=2 0Tomography (PET) imaging agents for assessing brain beta-amyloid and other pathophysiological features of AD requires toxicological testing of these agents prior to human studies.

The contract provides toxicology resources to academic and small business investigators who believe they have promising compounds for the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease or other aging-related diseases or have PET imaging agents but who do not have the resources to perform the required toxicology studies. This contact provides investigators access to toxicological evaluations that are required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when requesting an Investigational New Drug (IND) designation for clinical studies. This preclinical drug-development program expands the potential range of drug therapies and imaging agents for Alzheimer's disease and other aging-related diseases by making these resources available to a larger and more diverse group of investigators. 

This contract complements NIAs support of studies in preclinical drug discovery and development through a variety of grant and contract mechanisms for drugs to prevent and treat Alzheimers disease and other aging-related diseases and for imaging  agents. It provides NIA with the capability to translate basic science research into clinical trials by providing the resources needed by individual investigators and small companies to generate the toxicology data required to obtain an IND from the FDA to do initial human studies. Thus, the continuing availability of this contract is an important part of NIAs efforts to facilitate drug discovery, development, and testing for Alzheimers disease and other diseases of aging.

Capability statements from qualified small businesses should address their experience and capabilities in the following seven (7) areas: (1) analytical chemistry; (2) pharmacokinetics and bioavailability; (3) preliminary toxicity screens; (4) IND-directed toxicology studies; (5) safety pharmacology; (6) GLP and AAALAC accreditations; and (7) experience performing contracts of similar size and scope to this requirement. Capability statements should not exceed 10 single-sided pages (minimum 12 pt. font), excluding attachments.

Work assignment procedures may be utilized to control costs and effort.  Over the 5 year base period it is estimated that approximately 30,000 total labor hours would be required. Of these, approximately 7% would be professional staff hours and 93% support staff hours.

Your establishment must be in compliance with FDA Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and animal facilities must be accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).  For contract award you must have an Animal handling Certificate.

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS), Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is requesting submissions to pre-qualify construction firms for the construction of an Annex Office Building located on the New U.S. Embassy site in Beijing, China.  The project is described below:

Description:   The project will consist of (1) relocating underground utilities, including electric/water/sewer/storm water;  (2) construction of a 7-story 7,400 sqm office building, with an additional below ground level floor; and (3) upon completion of the Annex building, reconfiguration of office spaces in an adjoining office building.  The estimated construction price is in excess of $10 million.

Order of Magnitude  Cost
      The estimated construction cost of this building is in excess of $35 million U.S. dollars.

Drawings and Specifications
The office building is being designed under a separate contract and therefore the construction RFP will include a fully completed set of drawings and specifications. 
 
2.  Project Solicitation
	The project solicitation will consist of two phases.  

Phase I  Pre-Qualification of Offerors
	This announcement of solicitation of pre-qualification submissions is Phase I.  DOS will evaluate and rate the pre-qualification submissions based on the procedure and evaluation criteria set forth below.  DOS may refuse to pre-qualify any Offeror receiving less than a satisfactory rating on any evaluation factor or sub-factor.  

Both U.S. and Non-U.S. firms will be solicited to participate in this project (see paragraph 3 below for Percy Amendment requirements for U.S. contractors).  

Security Investigation:  Any U.S. citizens traveling to Beijing in conjunction with this RFP and subsequent contract will be required to have a favorable Moderate Risk Public Trust (MRPT) investigation conducted by the Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, or possess a current final Secret or Top Secret security clearance issued by Defense Security Service, prior to travel.  Procedures for obtaining a favorable MRPT and/or certifying existing personnel clearances will be outlined to interested U.S. offerors or individuals.

Phase II  Requests for Proposals from Pre-Qualified Offerors
	Those Offerors determined to be pre-qualified in accordance with this notice will be issued a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) and invited to submit proposed pricing in Phase II.  Each RFP will include a statement of work, standards, and criteria for the project that set out the project scope, construction process, reference drawings and specifications, codes and standards, and security requirements.  

The contract will be awarded on a fixed-price basis.  Construction services will include providing construction labor and materials to execute the design; on-site organization with management to ensure overall project coordination; and overall control throughout the life of the project.  Required services include but are not limited to preparation of quality control plans, safety plans, project schedules, and project close-out activities.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard, Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic, Norfolk, VA and the United States Coast Guard Academy, Leadership Development  Center (LDC), in  New London, Connecticut are seeking interested sources to provide all labor, supervision, transportation, training aids and training materials, except for facilities furnished by the government, for (1) an innovative Instructor Qualification Course (IQC) in leadership and (2) leadership course training materials for IQC trained instructors to use in subsequent LDC courses.  During the first year of this contract, the courses will be taught at the Leadership Development Center (LDC).  In subsequent years, the government may utilize additional locations.  The audience for the IQC will be Coast Guard officers, enlisted, Auxiliary, and civilian personnel currently assigned to the LDC, New London, CT.  Instructors certified through attendance at the IQC will subsequently teach LDC leadership courses and use the training materials purchased under the resultant contract.  The contracted instructors should have as a minimum, an earned masters degree, however, an earned doctorate is preferred, and a minimum of three years experience in a leadership position.  BACKGROUND:  The LDC is located at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, CT.  The LDCs Leadership and Quality Institute (LQI) is responsible for teaching and facilitating courses equivalent to civilian adult continuing professional education.  Over 4,000 students are taught each year in the LQIs Leadership and Management School; one of six major schools within the LDC.  Many of the officer, enlisted, civilian, and Auxiliary members of the Coast Guard will attend training provided by the LDCs LQI.  Omnipresent issues related to national security require that the Coast Guards leadership training be at the highest possible level appropriate to student experience and responsibilities.  It is necessary to approach Coast Guard leadership training in the same way that civilian corporations advance their employees leadership skills.  Rarely do successful civilian corporations have the manpower or materials to identify, design, and deliver their own state-of-the-art leadership curricula.  Civilian corporations contract out for sophisticated leadership training.  The Coast Guard cannot afford to purchase leadership training for all its personnel.  The next best option is to obtain a commercially prepared IQC to meet both the instructor-training requirement and the urgent need for quality in leadership training.  The Coast Guard is currently in the process of developing specific requirements for this course.  It is anticipated that this will be a fixed price contract for the majority of the requirements with travel being performed on a cost reimbursement basis.  The Coast Guard envisions the future contractor having an intricate network of resources to provide all aspects of the leadership training course and materials as described.  No solicitation exists for this requirement, therefore DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on FEDBIZOPS.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of any future solicitation or synopsis.  CONTRACTOR INFORMATION FOR SUBMISSION:  Interested contractors shall describe how they possess the experience and capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the requirements of providing the following:  1. Instructor Qualification Course in Leadership: a. Innovative Methods, b. Hands on Learning, c. Out of Seat Training, d. Problem Solving Methods, e. Student Centered Learning, f. Exercised Focused Training g. Interactive Scenarios and Role Playing.  2.  Instructors: Demonstrate that instructors possess at a minimum an earned masters degree, however, an earned doctorate is preferred, and a minimum of three years experience in a leadership position is required.  3.  LDC Instructors at the completion of the IQC will be certified to teach the training materials purchased under the resultant contract in LDC leadership classes.  4.  Leadership Course Training Materials: a. describe your course syllabus, course outline or course curriculum to be utilized.  b. Describe how you have prepared reusable instructor visual aids that reinforce the learning objectives in your course curriculum. c. Describe innovative student-training aids that will be effective in helping LDC students remember and implement learning objectives at their job sites. d. Describe student textbooks/workbooks that can be used by students who will be attending the LDC classes taught by the IQC trained instructors.  5.  Provide a project plan timeline or methodology outlining the necessary steps or milestones needed to implement an innovative and effective IQC.  DEMONSTRATION OF THE FOLLOWING IS RECOMMENDED, BUT NOT REQUIRED.  6.  Past experience in providing an instructor qualification course in leadership training for other Government Agencies.  7.  Past experience in providing an instructor qualification course in leadership training for other Universities or Colleges.  8. Past experience in providing an instructor qualification course in leadership training for other Coast Guard Commands.  9.  Past experience in providing an instructor qualification course in leadership training for other organizations.  The above information can be forwarded to the Contract Specialist via e-mail at wendy.j.culbreth@uscg.mil.  Responses should also include the following information:  company name, address, point of contact, phone number; DUNS number, business size to include status ( 8(a), SDB, HUBZONE, SDVOSB, etc), corporate affiliations, potential joint venture partners, teaming partners, or major subcontractors, GSA Contract information if applicable.  All relevant input is encouraged.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited; no basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this Sources Sought or Government use of any information provided.  The Government reserves the right to consider a small business, 8(a) or any other set aside arrangement as deemed appropriate for this procurement.

<DESC><p>Proposed addition of Folder, File, Manila Interior Recycled to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.</p>
<p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Folder, File, Manila Interior Recycled by the Federal Government.</p>
<p>The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.</p>
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7530-00-NIB-0878 Manila Interior File Folder 1/3 Letter 100 /BX</p>
<p>7530-00-NIB-0879 Manila Interior File Folder 1/3 Legal 100 /BX</p>
<p>7530-00-NIB-0889 Manila Interior File Folder Straight Cut Letter 100 /BX</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA New York NY.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Folder, File, Manila Interior Recycled to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>7530-00-NIB-0878</p>
<p>ESS 421013</p>
<p>SMD 10230</p>
<p>UNV 12213</p>
<p>SPR 40000</p>
<p>7530-00-NIB-0879</p>
<p>ESS 435013</p>
<p>SMD 15230</p>
<p>UNV 15213</p>
<p>SPR 40001</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Wiper, Laminated to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than Friday, January 9, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0030. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<ARCHDATE>03312009
<CONTACT>Michael King, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-baa-09-02@ugov.gov
<DESC><p>DESCRIPTION: The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is seeking proposals for innovative research and technology demonstrations for Biometrics Exploitation Science and Technology (BEST) to significantly advance the state of the science and enable revolutionary advances in algorithms, devices, and/or systems for non-contact biometrics.
<p>A Proposer's Day will be held on 15 January 2009, 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm, at the MITRE 1 Auditorium (7525 Colshire Drive, McLean, VA) to present the upcoming Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). A final BAA will follow Proposer's Day. Pre-registration for Proposer's Day is required via the website at http://204.255.139.124/BEST09/Registration/Default.aspx. Attendees are limited to a maximum of two representatives per company, organization or institution.</p>
<p>The BEST program consists of two main thrusts: (1) Exploitation and Analysis and (2) Robust Acquisition.</p>
<p>The Exploitation and Analysis research thrust is composed of three tracks which bound the biometric signatures of interest for this solicitation: 1) face recognition, 2) ocular recognition (i.e. iris recognition with proximal skin texture), and 3) speaker recognition. The thrust seeks to investigate techniques to derive and exploit biometric signatures from data collected under relaxed acquisition constraints while maintaining recognition performance similar to data acquired under controlled conditions. Given that data may originate from a variety of sources, techniques must operate without prior knowledge regarding characteristics of the sensor used during the acquisition.</p>
<p>The Robust Acquisition research thrust seeks to relax the constraints to enable the collection of high fidelity (1) 3D face (shape and texture) and (2) coupled face and ocular biometric features at standoff distance under uncontrolled acquisition conditions to enable the broader application of the technology. Representative acquisition constraints to be relaxed include, but are not limited to, subject motion, relative position to the sensor, and environmental influences. The minimum objective is to exceed by a factor of three what is commercially available today, with recognition performance similar to that achieved with the cooperative or conditioned individual under controlled acquisition.</p>
<p>Specifically excluded from this solicitation are contact-type biometric technologies, such as fingerprint, palm, etc., and proposals for product development or research that would primarily result in incremental, evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.</p>
<p>The goals of this Proposer's Day are to 1) familiarize participants with IARPA's interest in biometrics technologies; 2) promote an understanding of the BAA proposal submission requirements and process; and 3) foster discussion of synergistic capabilities among potential program participants.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION: If interested in attending industry day, please visit the registration website (http://www.iarpa.gov/best.html) and complete the form necessary to request an invitation. Non-US citizens are required to fill out a visit request form for Foreign Nationals. The registration deadline is 07 January 2009. If approved, you will be sent an invitation to attend.</p>
<p>INVITED INFORMATION: Attendees may hand out background materials regarding potential technology that may be applicable at the industry day during networking sessions. All handout materials must be unclassified and approved in advance by the organization that funded the research. No proprietary information should be included.</p>

DESCRIPTION:

The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Newport Corporation, of Irvine, CA for the purchase of motorized Positioning Controllers and Actuators under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106-(b): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

Product and the parts must be backward and forward compatible with Newport translation stages and Coherent BRF tuning systems using ESP 300 Controller, MM 300 Controller, 8 Channel Actuator Controller, 850G Actuator and LIA-HS Actuator. 

The Newport translation stages are platforms enabling linear translation in one dimension the platforms are 1 inch square or 2 inch square, with load capacities of several pounds they are typically side driven, crossed-roller stages equipped with an input split ring system for actuator attachment. The actuators can be manual or motorized for our application, we are requiring motorized actuators - that we can also turn by hand  this part is critical.  We have found it difficult to find these types of motorized actuators for an example translation stage product, see newport corporation's 462-x-sd stage.

BRF tuners are integral components of dye laser systems (see attached).  they are typically mounted in a special manual actuator-driven rotation stage.We have Coherent, Inc. dye lasers. We want to be able to replace the manual actuator in the BRF tuner in these systems with a motorized actuator in these systems.


 Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 1:00 p.m. (EST) on January 5, 2009.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to janet.lamb@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<p><br />ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.24 per hour or $129.60 per week or $561.60 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as numbered):</p>
<p>1) Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any<br />employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or<br />professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer<br />System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. <br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Website at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation) and computes a proposed rate).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<DESC>This procurement is a pilot project designed to assess the use of direct digital acquisition of aerial imagery with digital cameras/sensors.  The project is intended to be acquired in concurrence with the 2009 National Resources Inventory (NRI) program and Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) scheduled for film acquisition during the same photo periods.  This will allow government analysts to determine the feasibility of digital acquisition as directly compared to the film acquisition of identical sites and areas.  The requirements and specifications stated herein are an attempt to mimic as closely as possible the standard 1:7,920 scale film product with the comparable digitally acquired product.  The results of this pilot project and subsequent analysis may impact the direction of future NRI and WRP procurement strategies.  Refer to the attached RFQ for details.

MEMORANDUM OF STANDARD PROCEDURE
PORT HUENEME UNDERWAY REPLENISHMENT DEPARTMENT
PROCEDURE FOR HOT-DIP LUBRICATION OF SLIDING BLOCK DRIVE CHAINS
Notes:
A.	This procedure developed at the Navy Underway Replenishment Test Site at Port Hueneme. 
B.	Ensure sufficient quantity of make-up lubricant is on hand to augment loss from tank as each chain section is completed. One 55-gallon drum of Mobil ARMA 798 is usually enough make-up product to coat approximately 320 feet of double wide, number 160, two-inch pitch, cotter-constructed American standard roller chain using this procedure. This amount of chain is enough for two Navy standard sliding block drive stations.
C.	Chins May be coated in sections but all sections shall be treated using this procedure.
Procedure:
1.	Heat Mobil ARMA 798 (a Mobil Oil Company product) to 140-150 degrees F. 
In a tank with adequate volume to allow complete immersion of chain sections, heat Mobil ARMA 798 lubricant to a uniform temperature of 140 to 150 degrees F. Stir as required to eliminate any lumps of non-liquid, un-melted grease.
2.	Completely immerse chains into hot liquefied Mobil ARMA until up to temperature. 
If feasible and to save time, preheat chain sections to 140 to 150 degrees F. prior to immersing into hot liquid Mobil ARMA. Otherwise completely immerse ambient temperature chains into hot liquefied Mobil ARMA and allow sufficient soak time until chain temperature equals oil temperature of 140 to 150 degrees F. Correct temperature equalization point is achieved when entire length of chain is hoisted completely out of the tank and hot liquefied Mobil ARMA is observed running off with no solid, un-melted grease remaining on any chain surface.
3.	Soak chains an additional thirty minutes, flexing the chain at least three times. 
When the liquefied lubricant and chain have equalized at the desired temperature, continue to soak for a period of thirty minutes. Flex the chain to ensure thorough lubricant penetration by hoisting one end until the other end is lifted completely off the bottom of the tank, and then lowering back down. Perform at five, fifteen, and twenty-five minutes. This is required to remove air bubbles and fully impregnate the Mobil ARMA under the rollers.
4.	Remove heat; allow Mobil ARMA and chain to cool to 120 to 130 degrees F. 
Upon completion of the 30 minute soak and flex period, remove heat source to allow the lubricant and completely immersed chain to cool down together until a uniform solid coating of lubricant approximately 1/16 to 1/8 inch thick has formed on all external surfaces of the chain. This will be achieved at a chain and lubricant temperature of 120 to 130 degrees F. Periodically hoist the entire chain out of the lubricant to observe the gradual transition from complete liquid runoff to an increasing buildup of solidified grease. This step is required to prevent all the Mobil ARMA from draining off the chain when the chain is removed from the bath. No additional top coating of the chain should be necessary except for minor touch-up of any surface disturbed during assembly and installation of the chain.
5.	Remove chain sections from bath

The requested delivery date for the above items is 1 February 2009. Delivery address zip code is 23185.  Please provide the cost of freight charges if applicable.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking innovative solutions that will design, build, and test a legged vehicle capable of maneuvering robustly and nimbly among dismounted troops through complex terrain; carrying 400lb of equipment as well as sufficient fuel for 24 hours operation; sensing and negotiating terrain by autonomously selecting appropriate gaits, planning footfalls, and following a soldier through dynamic, cluttered environments; and operating quietly when required.  It is envisioned that this program will, at a minimum, deliver two prototype systems which will be able to follow a soldier 5-100m ahead among other troops and clutter, with zero burden on the operator to provide command or control signals.

<DESC>The following additional questions have been received and responses are provided:

Q6.  Under the Specialized Experience and Technical Competence section, it calls for experience in "stream and urban restoration.  Is this supposed to be urban stream restoration?"  If not, can you give a clarification on urban restoration?  Is that redeveloping urban areas, looking at environmental issues in urban area, etc?  
 
A6. "Stream and urban restoration" simply means stream restoration in an urban environment.  

Q7.  Also, can any further explanation/detail be given on what is included under water quality? (Does that refer to stream water quality, drinking water quality, sampling for water quality, etc?)

A7.  "Water quality"' applies to our projects (rivers and mostly reservoirs).  It's stream and reservoir water quality sampling such as temperature, PH, etc. for fish habitat and other species.  It's not for drinking water.

<DESC><p>SOLICITATION</p>
<p><strong>AMENDMENT 002 -</strong> This amendment is to extend the solicitation closing to 23 Decemeber 2008, 01:00 PM (EST), from 22 Decemeber 2008, 01:00 PM (EST), time required to answer vendors questions.</p>
<p><strong>AMENDMENT 001</strong>- THE FOLLOWING CLARIFICATIONS ARE PROVIDED IN RESPONSE TO VENDOR QUESTIONS, READ BELOW:</p>
<p><span>
<p>QUESTION: Our company is interested in subject solicitation and want to know if Federal Excise Tax should be added to our price quote and if it is applicable to this solicitation.</p>
<p>ANSWER: Although 26 U.S.C. Section 4181 imposes an excise tax on the manufacturer, producer, or importer on the sale of "...shells and cartridges," 26 U.S.C. 4182 provides that "No ... shells and cartridges purchased with funds appropriated for the military department shall be subject to any tax imposed on the sale or transfer of such articles." Thus, it is our opinion that no excise tax is due. Please note that this is the opinion of our in-house legal counsel and is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service. In taking any position with respect to taxes, recommend that you consult your own tax counsel.</p>
<p>THE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF QUOTES IS NOT EXTENDED.</p>
<p>DUE DATE AND TIME REMAINS 22 DEC 2008, NO LATER THAN 1:00PM(EST).</p>

Such activities may include, but are not limited, to planning, environmental/HTRW, safety and industrial hygiene, engineering, socioeconomic, and real estate work.  Engineering tasks may require experience in geological, civil, and environmental engineering. Environmental tasks may require experience in biological, chemical, geological, physical science, hazardous material and hazardous waste management, database management and erosion and sedimentation control plans. Safety and industrial hygiene tasks may require experience in industrial hygiene; developing site specific work plans with accompanying sub plans, implementation and evaluation of Contractor quality control plans. The NAICS code is 562910, and the small business size standard of 500 employees. The solicitation will include the following know options: The total capacity of the contracts awarded under this solicitation shall not exceed $9,500,000.00.   The total contract period will not exceed five years from date of award of contract.  The contract will consist of a base period not to exceed one year, with a maximum of four one-year option periods.   The RFP will be issued on or about the month of January 2009. The option to exercise is a unilateral right of the Government based upon contractors performance. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District anticipates the award of a negotiated firm fixed price contract using source selection procedures to obtain the greatest value for the Government. The Government intends to use the best value process in selecting the contractor. Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted. The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussions. The Government will evaluate all proposals and establish a competitive range if necessary. The evaluation team will comply with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District Source Selection Policy with respect to nondisclosure, conflict of interest, safeguarding of data and any other regulatory or statutory requirement therein stated or referenced. Award of a contract will be contingent upon funding approval. The solicitation will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps). All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency. FedBizOpps.gov is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies. At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information: Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address. Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status. The list of plan holders will be based only on those requesting the proposal documents via FedBizOpps (see above) through the link contained in this announcement. Those requesting specifications must first register at www.ccr.gov. Contact Heather Morrow, Contracting Specialist, for questions concerning this announcement at 816-389-3320.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, intends to issue solicitations for Environmental Services IDIQ contracts. Task orders issued under the contract may be located within CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories. It is anticipated that the majority of the work to be completed under this contract will be in support of the Kansas City Districts (District) Environmental Compliance/Environmental Quality Program in support of various Department of Defense customers and clients such as, but not limited to, Army installations, Army Reserve Regional Readiness Commands and Headquarters elements, Major Commands, the National Guard Bureau and state agencies.  However, work performed may also include providing environmental support to the Districts civil works and hazardous, toxic, and radio-active waste (HTRW) program areas, as well. Contractor shall assist in performing a full range of military installation support and civil works activities within the environmental pillars of compliance, conservation, restoration, and pollution prevention.  Supporting activities may include providing onsite support in various environmental programs, as well as conducting studies and investigations, preparing reports, database management; life, health safety planning and assessment activities; and real estate activities. Such activities may include, but are not limited, to planning, environmental/HTRW, safety and industrial hygiene, engineering, socioeconomic, and real estate work.  Engineering tasks may require experience in geological, civil, and environmental engineering. Environmental tasks may require experience in biological, chemical, geological, physical science, hazardous material and hazardous waste management, database management and erosion and sedimentation control plans. Safety and industrial hygiene tasks may require experience in industrial hygiene; developing site specific work plans with accompanying sub plans, implementation and evaluation of Contractor quality control plans. The NAICS code is 562910, and the small business size standard of 500 employees. The solicitation will include the following know options: The total capacity of the contracts awarded under this solicitation shall not exceed $9,500,000.00.   The total contract period will not exceed five years from date of award of contract.  The contract will consist of a base period not to exceed one year, with a maximum of four one-year option periods.   The RFP will be issued on or about the month of January 2009. The option to exercise is a unilateral right of the Government based upon contractors performance. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District anticipates the award of a negotiated firm fixed price contract using source selection procedures to obtain the greatest value for the Government. The Government intends to use the best value process in selecting the contractor. Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted. The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussions. The Government will evaluate all proposals and establish a competitive range if necessary. The evaluation team will comply with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District Source Selection Policy with respect to nondisclosure, conflict of interest, safeguarding of data and any other regulatory or statutory requirement therein stated or referenced. Award of a contract will be contingent upon funding approval. The solicitation will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps). All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency. FedBizOpps.gov is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies. At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information: Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address. Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status. The list of plan holders will be based only on those requesting the proposal documents via FedBizOpps (see above) through the link contained in this announcement. Those requesting specifications must first register at www.ccr.gov. Contact Heather Morrow, Contracting Specialist, for questions concerning this announcement at 816-389-3320. Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Alan Gehrt, (816) 389-3142.<BR><BR><BR>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>******NOTICE***** Amendment R0003 is scheduled to be released the week of 15 December 2008 and will include a complete, revised set of drawings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;***** NOTICE: ***** This notice amends the previously-issued Presolicitation Notice to advise potential offerors of the magnitude of this construction project. The magnitude of this project is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.</p>
<p>Previously posted Presolicitation Notice with changes annotated by asterisk:</p>
<p>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The US Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District will issue a Request for Proposal for the construction of Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH) consisting of a 144-person barracks facility at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. ***** The magnitude of this project is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.***** The solicitation will be available for download on or about November 15, 2008. The closing date for receipt of proposals is January 15, 2009 (unless changed by an official amendment to the solicitation). The solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis using full and open competitive procedures. The procurement will be conducted using source selection procedures and the award will be based on the best value to the Government considering price and non-price factors cited in this announcement and the solicitation. Any resulting contract will be firm-fixed price. NAICS Code: 236220 with a current size standard of $33,500,000. The Federal Supply Code is Y163. Offerors are advised that a contract resulting from this solicitation is contingent upon funding and Congressional approval. Should Congress not authorize this project or appropriate the funds, the solicitation will be canceled. If the project is canceled, all proposal preparation costs will be borne by the offeror. If a large business is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirements for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The FY08 subcontracting goals for this contract are a minimum of 70.0% of the contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses, 6.2% of that to small disadvantaged businesses, 7.0% to woman-owned small businesses, 9.8% to HUBzone small businesses, and 3.0% to veteran-owned small business, and 0.9% to service disabled veteran-owned small business. The Davis-Bacon Act will apply. All responders are advised that this project may be canceled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation and final award. All contractors are advised that they must be registered in CCR and ORCA (http://orca.bpn.gov). Joint ventures must also be registered in CCR and ORCA as a joint venture. We advise contractors to begin this process when they prepare their proposal in order to ensure registration is in place should they be selected for the award. "Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award." (Reference DFAR 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration). PROJECT INFORMATION: The project includes connection to an energy monitoring and control system (EMCS), building information system and anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) measures such as structural reinforcements, setbacks, and reinforced (laminated) glass.

Access for individuals with disabilities will be provided in public areas. Comprehensive building and furnishings interior design services are required. This acquisition is a 1-Phase solicitation where performance capability and price are evaluated in a single phase. SELECTION CRITERIA: Award will be based on the Best Value approach. Offerors will be evaluated based upon the following non-price evaluation factor: Performance Capability to include: specialized experience; past performance; proposed contract duration and summary schedule; key personnel capabilities and experience; small business utilization; and Price. The Subcontracting Plan required for Large Businesses will be evaluated on a Go/No Go basis. The overall non-price evaluation rating is considered more important than price.

All solicitation documents will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website, http://www.fbo.gov.

<SUBJECT>Romania - LNG Import Terminal Project
<SOLNBR>0881029A
<RESPDATE>011609
<CONTACT>John Kusnierek, Phone (703) 875-4357, Email jkusnierek@ustda.gov
<DESC>Reference is made to the December 19, 2008 announcement, reference number 0881029A, inviting submission of qualifications and proposal data for the Romania - LNG Import Terminal Project.

This is to notify interested U.S. firms of the following requests/responses for clarification to the Romania - LNG Import Terminal Project.


Task 4 - Site Evaluation

Requests for Clarification - 
The requirement specifies that the Contractor will evaluate a site at the port of Constantza, as well as another prospective site on the Black Sea coastline to be designated by ROMGAZ. Could you please confirm that the scope of work is to conduct site evaluations for two separate sites with the goal of comparing the two alternative sites to assist ROMGAZ in the selection of the preferred terminal site to be conducted for the rest of the feasibility study? Can you please indicate how and when ROMGAS will identify the second prospective terminal site? What criteria does ROMGAZ anticipate using to identify a second site?

Response - 
This task will include the gathering of technical data, performance of environmental and regulatory reviews, and comparative assessments of the Port of Constantza and another site for the LNG import terminal. The Port of Constantza is presently identified by the Romanian Government as the best site for locating the terminal. However, the Constantza Port Authority operates a few smaller ports and an offshore terminal for importing crude oil is operational along the Black Sea coastline. In addition, while an important aspect of the site selection would be the needs for connecting the LNG terminal to and upgrading the existing pipeline grid operated by TRANSGAZ, the importance of the findings of Tasks 1 - 3 of the Feasibility Study on the size and type of the terminal in selecting the candidate sites should not be overlooked. The final decision of ROMGAZ on the selection of candidate sites for Task 4 and the consideration of alternative scenarios for building and operating the terminal in Task 5 may therefore have to wait for the Interim Report on the Feasibility Study. Bidders for the feasibility study are encouraged to include in their technical proposals an explanation of how the findings of Tasks 1 - 3 will be used to provide guidelines for consideration by ROMGAZ in their site selection for Task 4.    

Task 5 - Preliminary Design of LNG Terminals and Marine Facility

Requests for Clarification - 
The requirement specifies that the Contractor will conduct preliminary designs for two alternative scenarios to receive, store, and re-gasify LNG at the selected site, and to transmit the gas through the existing network of pipelines or to new transmission/reception facilities. Is the requirement to complete full preliminary design for two distinct terminal designs? Can you please clarify who will define the alternative scenarios? Can you please clarify how the two alternative scenarios will be defined? Will the scenarios definition be limited to throughput and storage volume parameters, or will the scenarios involve more complicated differences such as technology choices, onshore and offshore configurations, terminal layout, etc.?

Response - The requirement is to conduct preliminary design of the LNG terminal and marine facility for two alternative scenarios, which should be developed by the Contractor in conjunction with the Grantee based on the findings of Tasks 1-3 on the size and type of LNG terminal and evaluation of sites in Task 4. Bidders for the feasibility study are encouraged to include in their technical proposals an explanation of how these findings will be used to develop the scenarios for Task 5. 

Additional Requests for Clarification

It is our understanding that ROMGAZ is the sponsor for the Feasibility Study to be undertaken upon the conclusion of this RFP process. Can you please clarify how other critical stakeholders in the LNG terminal project have been, or will be, included in the feasibility project (TRANSGAZ, ELCEN, ANRE, DISTRIGAZ SUD)? Can it be expected that such critical stakeholders will be actively involved in ROMGAZs management of this feasibility study? Can you please clarify how ROMGAZ anticipates supporting the Contractor in the various activities? For example, under Task 1, it is stated that the Grantee will assist the Contractor in gathering data and information from other GOR agencies and facilitating necessary meetings. It is also stated that the Grantee will enable the contractor to have productive discussions with representative from end-user entities. How does ROMGAZ anticipating providing this level of support? Will ROMGAZ designate and assign one or more representatives to support such activities? Can you please clarify how ROMGAZ anticipate managing and participating in the study? Have one or more representatives from ROMGAZ been designated as the lead contact(s) for the project?

General Response to Additional Requests for Clarification

The Romanian Government is presently the sponsor of the LNG import terminal project and it has designated ROMGAZ, which is the state-owned enterprise in Romania responsible for exploring and producing natural gas in the country, as the beneficiary of the feasibility study. ROMGAZ is both committed to and capable of developing and operating large projects involving natural gas. The organizational details of the support to be provided to the feasibility study should be addressed by the selected bidder at the time of signing a contract to perform the study with ROMGAZ, however.
