<DESC>Research Plan for Restoration of Native Plant Communities at Ouray NWR
Background/Overview
Ouray National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is a 12,000 acre Refuge located in NE Utah in Uintah County.  The Refuge is comprised of riparian woodlands, floodplain wetland bottoms, upland grasslands and shrubs with 16 miles of the Green River within the Refuge boundary.  The five floodplain bottoms primarily receive water during high flows of the Green River.  Much of the floodplain bottoms and grasslands had been farmed prior to the establishment of the Refuge in 1960.  Over the past several years, Ouray National Wildlife Refuge has attempted to restore uplands that have been degraded by disturbance and/or dominant invasive weeds.  A variety of seeding techniques and irrigation has been used.  However, success in restoration has been very poor.  
Ouray NWR has a great need to have the knowledge and ability to successfully restore uplands and riparian areas.  There has been considerable disturbance with past and present farming, disturbance with developments, and ongoing invasive weed issues.  In the near future, it is expected that a couple thousand acres of saltcedar will be drastically reduced due to successful biological control.  Restoration in some of those areas will be crucial to reduce invasion by other weeds such as Russian olive.  Past restoration attempts have further disturbed the soil increasing invasive weed populations.  The climate at Ouray NWR is semi-arid with only 7 inches of rain annually and native desert grasses can be very slow to develop.  Attempts at irrigation have significantly increased the kochia stand which in turn has crowded out native plant germination and growth.
An experimental plan has been established to test several methods of seeding techniques with and without irrigation, the use of cover and nurse crops, control of invasive weeds during restoration seeding and growth, and the success of several native grass species.  Ouray NWR is seeking a consultant to implement the experimental design as planned, assist with monitoring of invasive weed controls and native species response, synthesize raw data for statistical analysis, and complete interim and final reports.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, NHGRI),  intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Invitrogen, 3175 Staley Road, Grand Island, New York 14072 to procure a genome-wide collection of Ambion Silencer Select siRNAs.

The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives.  The National Institutes of Health has begun preparations to establish an RNAi facility to provide intramural researchers with access to the equipment and expertise necessary to conduct genome-wide RNAi screens in mammalian cells. This facility will work as a collaborative resource for doing RNAi assay development, screening, and initial follow up.  Our facility will be working with investigators to develop and optimize their assays for screening, conduct the screens and related informatics analyses, then perform follow-up screens on promising leads.

This purchase is for a genome-wide collection of Ambion Silencer Select siRNAs. Ambion Silencer Select siRNAs are used for the gene specific knockdown of mRNA transcripts in cells. This library has 3 independent siRNAs per gene arrayed in individual wells of 384 well plates. This item is needed to facilitate our RNAi screening program. This program is to conduct genome-wide siRNA screens in collaboration with NIH intramural investigators. This work includes RNAi assay development, screening, and initial follow up. The Ambion siRNA library will be used for genome-wide siRNA screens in human cells. 

Description:

1. Silencer Select HM Genome siRNA Library V4, SKU# 4397926, Quantity 1.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that siRNA experiments can be hampered by poor on-target knockdown and undesired off-target effects. Ambion Silencer Select siRNAs represent a highly optimized product, incorporating the latest in siRNA design and chemistries to provide effective and specific knockdown of corresponding gene targets. The Ambion design algorithm incorporates over 90 different parameters that lead to increased efficacy and decreased off-target effects. Chemical modifications of the siRNAs also consistently enhance guide strand bias and reduce off-target effects. All of these features lead to the cleanest data possible, which is imperative for meaningful RNAi experiments. In fact, in side-by-side tests, Silencer Select reagents result in a higher percentage of expected phenotypes than those from other siRNA vendors. Ambion also offers the best guarantee in the industry, stating that 2 of 3 siRNAs will yield a better than 80% knockdown of target levels. As the genome-wide library consists of 3 siRNAs per gene, this means that multiple siRNAs targeting genes related to a particular biology under investigation will likely be identified from the screen data (i.e. a reduced rate of false negatives). 

No other product offers all the advantages of Ambion Silencer Select siRNAs, NHGRI have already optimized protocols for a number of on-going studies using Ambion Silencer Select siRNAs and they have proven to be reliable reagents. This will allow NHGRI to be able to extend these optimized conditions to genome-wide screening without expensive and laborious re-optimization. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

 The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Human Genome Research Institute, NHGRI), 9800 Medical Center Drive, Building 2B-2, Room 3005 , Rockville, Maryland 20850.

Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 325413, In-Vitro Diagnostic Substance Manufacturing, 
with size standard of 500 employees.  The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-43 (July 2, 2010).

<DESC>The National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), Alaska Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), conducts research and monitoring on bearded, spotted, ringed, and ribbon seals, species that are protected under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act and considered for listing as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). All four species are associated with sea ice during parts of the year, especially during their reproductive periods. Major breeding areas of all four species are found in the western Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk, within the Exclusive Economic Zone of the Russian Federation. The population sizes in these areas, which are fundamental numbers for evaluating the species' status under the ESA, are extremely imprecise, outdated, or simply unknown.
<p>This work will provide critically needed estimates of the abundance of ice-associated seals in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. Aerial photographic and multi-spectral surveys of seals on sea ice shall be designed and conducted by the contractor in a contractor-provided airplane. The multi-spectral imagery will be analyzed by the contractor for numbers and densities of seals, by species. NMML scientists will combine these results with independent estimates of the proportions of the populations in the water during the aerial surveys (and unavailable for counting) to obtain estimates of total abundance with adequate precision for ESA status evaluations and detection of future population changes in response to climate warming and loss of sea ice.</p>
<p>Approximately 23,500 km of aerial, multi-spectral survey track line will be required in a spring (April-May 2011) survey period. The exact target for track lengths and locations will be determined jointly by the contractor and NMML scientists in a survey design process that considers typical density estimates of these species found in similar surveys conducted recently in U.S. waters. Two workshops will be held to facilitate and review the survey design process.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide a team with demonstrated experience in multi-spectral (e.g., high-resolution visible, infrared, and ultraviolet) remote sensing of seals on sea ice, and a proven ability to implement a systematic and comprehensive survey of a large region such as an Arctic or sub-Arctic sea. The contractor shall be required to submit draft and final reports describing the methods and results of the surveys, as well as copies of all data including survey images, track line navigation data, and associated survey covariates such as weather conditions. Period of performance will be 9/20/2010-12/20/2013, with no option periods.</p>
<p>The contractor shall have personnel who are fluent in spoken and written Russian and English, familiar with the vocabulary of marine mammalogy, experienced in the methods for surveying seals, and familiar with the geography of the Russian Far East.

<DESC>NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is conducting research to understand how changes in ocean conditions due to variation in climate affects salmon survival, particularly during the first few months after juveniles enter the ocean. NMFS scientists have found that plasma levels of a hormone, insulin like growth factor I (IGF I), are correlated with instantaneous growth rate in sexually immature salmon and thus can be used as a physiological index of body growth rate. The goal of this project is to monitor levels of IGF I in juvenile salmon caught off the coasts of Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska in relation to oceanographic conditions in those locations. Plasma levels of the androgenic hormone, 11-ketotestosterone, are measured so that sexually maturing males can be removed from the analysis. Previous research has shown that smolt to adult coho salmon return rates are strongly affected by how well salmon survive the first few months at sea, and this is correlated with growth (plasma IGF I levels) during this period.<br /><br />Since ocean conditions vary from year to year and are not predictable, this work must be conducted over several years to determine large-scale patterns associated with climate change. Thus the request is for an initial year and option for four additional years of work. Data obtained from this work will assist NMFS in developing better tools for forecasting adult salmon returns.
<p>The contractor shall collect blood samples from salmon and other marine fish in order to determine plasma insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I, a hormone that is a biomarker for growth) and 11-ketotestosterone (11KT, a hormone that is a biomarker for male maturation). The following is required for this work: a) collect blood samples from the fish of interest in Puget Sound and coastal areas of Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska on research cruises of up to 3 weeks duration; b) be responsible for preparing, organizing and storing plasma at sea; and c) record and maintain data on fish and plasma samples.</p>
<p>This requirement calls for the measuring of up to 4,000 samples of plasma levels of 11-ketotestosterone by enzyme immunoassay and salmon IGF I by specific time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay.</p>
<p>Period of performance for the base period shall be September 7, 2010 through September 6, 2011. Four one-year option periods may follow.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. A Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation may be available mid- to late July 2010 at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. The estimated response due date will be mid- to late August, 2010.

Environmental Protection AgencyChild Care Tuition Assistance Program AdministrationPerformance Work Statement
Background
The contractor will administer the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Child Care Tuition Assistance Program. Congress passed Public Law 107-67, Section 630 on November 12, 2001, which permits federal agencies to assist their lower income federal employees with the costs of child care. Tuition assistance can reduce the amount of tuition parents pay for child care by providing subsidies directly to the child care provider. Section 630 of this law provides permanent legislation authorizing executive agencies to use appropriated funds for child care services for lower income employees. 
Performance Objective
EPA requires a contractor with the ability to receive a specified sum of money from the Agency and distribute it to child care providers as tuition assistance funds.
Tuition Assistance Eligibility and Determination of Tuition Assistance Subsidy Amount
Application forms will be available on a web site maintained by EPA at the following address: http://intranet.gov. Completed applications will be sent directly to the contractor, who will determine eligibility and the tuition assistance amount based on the formula provided under the ineligibility Criteria'' section in this document. Tuition assistance through the fiscal year will be disbursed by the contractor. Required reports will be furnished by the contractor. The Government shall have the option to extend the program four additional years. Applications will be received on a first-come, first-served basis until funds have been exhausted. Applications received and approved will be effective the Monday following the week of receipt and approval.
Funding for Tuition Assistance Payment
Within eight weeks of the close of the application deadline, the contractor will provide the Project Officer with an estimate of the funds needed for tuition assistance or providers through September 30 of each year.
Performance Standards

Notify the parents and child care providers of the percentage of tuition assistance that each family will receive, and their effective dates no later than two weeks after receipt of application.
Notify employees if they have been, or if they have not been accepted into the program within three weeks after receipt of application. Notify the Project Officer of applicants who have been denied and why.
Provide the Project Officer with an estimate of the funds needed for tuition assistance payments to providers through September 30 of each year.
Provide information on the tuition assistance program in response to requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act or Privacy Act.
Maintain confidential all information contained in tuition assistance applications and ensure that only the contractor, the Project Officer, and child care provider know the identity of the applicant. On an as needed basis, the project Officer may receive a copy of the applications).
Ensure that those child care providers that receive federal funds as a result of the Agency's tuition assistance program are licensed and/or regulated by state and/or local authorities.
Require child care providers to submit a copy of their latest license and/or statement of compliance from their state and/or local authorities.
Require child care providers to submit a completed copy of OPM Form 1644.
Ensure that licensed child care providers understand that if a provider, for whatever reason, is no longer licensed and/or regulated by the state and/or local authorities, the provider will immediately notify the contractor, the Project Officer, and the federal employee whose child is enrolled in the child care program. In such cases, the provider will no longer be permitted to receive tuition funds.
Upon receipt of invoices and verification of the tuition assistance amounts from the child  care providers, vendor should verify that services were provided', and provide payment based on the invoiced amount not later than 14 days from the date the invoice was received. The contractor will pay the tuition assistance directly to the child care provider and not to the federal employee.

EPA Program Provisions
Project Officer for EPA Program and ContractPatricia Midgett, National Program Manager - 202-564-3006
The Environmental Protection Agency's Child Care Tuition Assistance Program is available at all our locations. The Child Care Tuition Assistance Program has been extended agency-wide to all eligible employees under the provisions mentioned in this SOW.
Now that Public Law 107-67, Section 630 is permanent (as of November 12. 2001); EPA is exercising the contract to extend the program to all EPA locations and is increasing the total family income criteria level to $75,000 and under.
EPA still maintains the right to: Discontinue the program based on limited agency resources or other factors', or make this a permanent program.
Application Procedures
Applications for the EPA Child Care Tuition Assistance Program can be downloaded from the child care website at: http://intranet.epa.gov/. An applicant may be contacted for clarification on their tuition assistance application. The following documents will be required: 
1.	Pay statements for the two (2) most recent pay periods for each parent or guardian, 
2.	A copy of the most recent federal income tax return for each parent or guardian, 
3.	A completed OPM form 1644 (April 2002), a Child Care Provider Form, signed by the child care provider, and a copy of the child care provider's most recent license or statement of compliance with State and/or local child care regulations. (Note: lf care is provided by more than one child care provider, a completed Form 1644 and accompanying documentation must be submitted for each provider).
Approved applications received after the initial deadline will be effective the Monday following the week of receipt. Only one application per employee will be accepted. If both parents/guardians are employed at EPA, only one parent/guardian may submit an application for the same child or children. 
Applications that are not fully completed or do not contain the requested information will not be processed and will be returned to the applicant. If the applicant does not provide all of the information requested in the application, she/he will not receive tuition assistance. When more than one parent works for the Federal Government, tuition assistance cannot be awarded for the child/children by more than one Federal agency.
To determine whether employees meet the requirements for tax exemption, they should refer to IRS Publication 503, which may be downloaded from the IRS web site www.irs.gov or they can order directly from IRS by calling 1-800-829-3676. Employees must use Form 1040, or  line 19 of Form 1040A)  area and attach a completed Form 2441 or Schedule 2 when they file their tax return in order to claim the exemption. Employees must be notified of this IRS law since it will affect their taxes.
Eligibility Criteria
The EPA has established the following provisions for determining both eligibility and the amount of the tuition assistance subsidy. The amount of assistance employees can receive depends on their total family income and the amount they pay for child care. The chart below shows the percentage of their total child care costs that EPA will pay based on their total family income.
If Employee's Total Family Income Is?.	Then EPA Will Pay This Percentage of Employee's Child Care CostsOver $75,000 	0%$51,000 - $75,000 	25%$36,000 - $51,000 	45%Less than $36,000 	65%	
If employees feel their subsidy is taxable and will affect their total tax liability, they may wish to change the amount withheld for taxes from their hi-weekly pay. If a participating employee's total family income changes, the employee must contact the contractor. Eligibility criteria and percentage of child care costs paid may be modified according to Agency requirements.
Definition of a Child
As provided in the regulations that implement Public Law 107-67, for the purpose of this program, a child is considered to be: 
a)	A biological child who lives with the Federal employee b)	An adopted child; A stepchild; A foster childc)	A child for whom judicial determination of support has been obtained d)	A child to whose support the Federal Employee who is a parent or legal guardian makes regular and substantial contributions

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) is supporting the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Office of Environment and Energy, in facilitating the efforts of establishing new day/night average sound level (DNL) replacement metrics. The FAA's Office of Environment and Energy has indentified critical research needs to advance analysis of the impacts of aviation noise and to develop socially optimal mitigation solutions. One critical research need is to determine whether the current basis for establishing significant impact needs updating to better reflect the current state of community annoyance to today's aircraft noise exposure.
<p>The Volpe Center, in support of the FAA, seeks a contractor to identify supplementary or replacement metrics to DNL that could help to better capture the relationship between community annoyance and noise exposure due to aircraft. A detailed statement of work will be set forth in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). The complete RFQ will be issued on or about July 22 2010. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541330 and the small business size standard is $4.5M. This procurement will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures on an unrestricted basis.</p>

<DESC>Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC (SRNS), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site (SRS) for the Department of Energy, solicits expressions of interest from companies wishing to license or enter into a Funds-In Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to further develop a Dissolution Actuated Valve Sampler. Engineers at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) have developed a sampling device which can collect uncontaminated discrete fluid samples without utilizing the assistance of a mast or messenger device. The sampler operates passively to eliminate the need for any additional pumps or vacuums. The sampler is both opened and closed within the fluid at the desired sample level; this ensures there is no mixing between fluid layers. Since the sampler is sealed before exiting the fluid it may be washed prior to retrieval thereby reducing any exposure hazards to the operator. Any company interested in licensing this device or participating in a Funds-In CRADA must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later that 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity. Qualified companies will be provided with further information on the technology. Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to the Point of Contact identified in this Notice. This is not a procurement; it is a request for parties interested in Licensing this invention or participating in a Funds-In CRADA only.

<DESC><p>The Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) anticipates issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for offers to administer the Department of Defense (DoD) National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship Program on or about08 Jul 2010. The NDSEG program promotes education in science and engineering disciplines relevant to the defense mission through three-year graduate fellowships to U.S. citizens who have demonstrated ability and special aptitude for advanced training in science and engineering. Preference is given to applicants who indicate intentions to pursue doctoral degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. NDSEG Fellows may choose U.S. institutions of higher education with accredited programs in the appropriate STEM disciplines. Recipients of NDSEG Fellowships do not incur any military obligation. The NDSEG Fellowship program provides monthly stipends to the Fellows as well as payment of full tuition and required fees to the Fellows' institutions of choice. Each application will be evaluated and ranked by a disciplinary panel of academic experts from the STEM discipline of the applicant's proposed advanced degree program. Final selection of awardees is made by the three participating DoD services: the AFOSR, the Army Research Office and the Office of Naval Research. The current stipend amount starts at $30,500, prorated monthly based on a twelve-month academic year. The present contract (FA9550-05-C-0059) was awarded in August 2005. The contract covers the administrative cost of the program and allows for transfer of funds (pass through funding) to the contractor to pay participants' stipends and academic fees. The current contract's final period of performance for the three-year program is March 2010 to July 2013. AFOSR plans to compete and issue a follow-on contract to start in March 2011. AFOSR is seeking qualified sources to provide the necessary personnel, accounting, administrative and database management services, and other resources required for the administration of the NDSEG Fellowship program. The successful offeror will be required to work with the incumbent contractor, as necessary, to smoothly transition administration of the program, as well as be required to transition administration of the contract to a successor contractor when the contract performance period ends. Functions required to administer the program include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: advertising the NDSEG Fellowship program; soliciting qualified applicants; collecting and receiving applications in a secure electronic (online) format; distributing applications among the disciplinary panels for evaluation to the three participating DoD services for selection; making offers of appointment to selected applicants and notifying unsuccessful applicants; administering payment of stipends to Fellows and payment of tuition and required fees to institutions; gathering and maintaining data, suitable for analysis and presentations, from current and former participants and unsuccessful applicants; organizing a yearly NDSEG panel of PhDs to evaluate the applications. DoD anticipates awarding a minimum of one hundred (100) and a maximum of three hundred (300) new three-year NDSEG Fellows each fiscal year subject to the availability of funds. AFOSR anticipates a contract with a potential length of seven years to cover five Fellowship classes. Under the proposed contract, the administration provided by the contractor will be through a Cost Plus Fixed Fee arrangement, while the pass through funds for students' stipends, tuition and fees will be through a Cost Reimbursable arrangement. The proposed service North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS Code) is 561110, Management Services, size standard $5.0M. Respondents should identify if they are a small disadvantaged business based on this NAICS code. Interested sources are requested to provide a concise capability statement, limited to three pages, addressing past three years of experience relevant to the above described functions, to include: experience in similar programs; knowledge of appropriate means to publicize the program and recruit participants; familiarity with issues related to conducting research in science and engineering; ability to attract university faculty members of the science and engineering community to serve on evaluation panels; cost accounting and financial management systems adequate to track costs, issue stipends and pay academic expenses; database management capabilities to gather and maintain data; and other resources necessary to conduct a program of this magnitude in a timely manner. Reference to past customers for similar services should include organization name, point of contact name and telephone number. Capability statements will be screened using the above described capabilities to identify qualified sources. Interested sources are encouraged to provide capability statements no later than 28 April 2010 to the Contract Specialist/Negotiator, Ms. Patricia Gorski, at AFOSR/PKS, 875 N.

<DESC>Under the contemplated contract action, ViaSat, Inc. will provide RIMS spares equipment (items shown in the table below) needed to allow quick turn-around when outages occur . The RIMS is a principal part of the RSTN which consists of four solar radio observatory systems geographically positioned such that solar radio frequencies can be observed on a 24 hour-per-day basis. It automatically monitors, collects, quantifies and reports solar radio events on eight discrete frequencies using three parabolic dish antennas. Both standard reports and alerts are produced when appropriate. Data is processed on-site at each network location and summaries and alerts are forwarded to Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA). Processed data is transmitted continuously, within one minute of observation. The data is applied to meet Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Material Command (AFMC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and national program stated requirements for alerts and warnings when solar flares occur. This data is also applied to forecasts of near-earth space environmental conditions that adversely impact military satellite and surveillance systems, as well as High Frequency (HF) and satellite communications and power grids.
<p>This is a first time buy of these items.The quantity of these items is sufficient since they will only be used to replace failed items while those items are repaired.</p>
<p>This sparing action is expected to last at least 5 years or until another major modification or replacement of the RIMS system.</p>
<p>The specific spares equipment items required are:</p>
<p>Item Part Number Site(s) Qty<br />3415 Gear box 1040414 Palehua 1<br />3425 Gear Box 1040415 Palehua 1<br />3415 Ring Gear Bearing 724616-0001 Palehua 1<br />3425 Ring Gear Bearing 1011911 Palehua 1<br />Interlock Switches 446864 Learmonth/San Vito/Sag Hill/Palehua 8</p>

In general, this LCBS consists of various CNC turned/milled (up to 5-axis may be necessary) billet aluminum and steel parts, an injection molded plastic part, Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) fasteners, an impact mitigation system as well as formed spring steel components.  Tolerances of the parts can be held as tightly as 1/1000 of an inch. Many of the parts are heat treated and then have a final protective finish (e.g. phosphate/anodize) conforming to various military standards.  After fabrication, the parts then are to be assembled to produce the buttstock assembly. Assembly may include pressing pins and bushings into place, flaring ends of fasteners and applying proper torque to screws after the addition of thread locking adhesives.  The assembled unit weight is approximately 1.9 pounds.  Inspection of these parts is to conform to various military standards and drawings and may require coordinate measuring machines, optical comparators, etc.  The contractor would need to at minimum be capable of performing the above tasks in-house or be proficient in subcontracting the tasks out to qualified vendors. 
Since this M249 LCBS is on the US Munitions List, an ITAR registration is required.  Interested parties are required to show verification of a valid, NOT expired, ITAR registration.  This is a requirement IN ADDITION TO the requirement to be registered with the US/Canada Joint Certification Office with an approved DD 2345 Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement.  ALL documents must be provided PRIOR to receiving a TDP.

To obtain a copy of the TDP, AFTER the Solicitation package is released, interested contractors must mail/email, to the POC listed below, a signed and approved DD Form 2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement along with a completed and signed AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Questionnaire (with all appropriate supporting AMSTA-AR Form 1350 supporting documentation) and a completed and signed U.S. Government Non-Disclosure / Non-Use Agreement.
The TDP will be supplied on a CD ROM disc and will be an Exhibit with the Solicitation package. It will be marked with a Distribution D restrictive marking which limits distribution to US based Department of Defense (DoD) contractors only. This TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22. U.S.C., Sec 2751, et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979(Title 50, U.S.C., App. 2401 et seq.), as amended. Violators of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.
At this time, there is no firm Request for Proposal (RFP) or anticipated release date.  It is anticipated that any RFP will result in award of a Firm-Fixed-Price Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity Contract with five one year ordering periods. The Government may elect to award multiple IDIQ contracts with each order placed via the Fair Opportunity process.  The maximum program ordering quantity is estimated to be 172,000 each, M249 LCBS plus associated Spare Parts, plus First Article Test quantities. The minimum program ordering quantity is estimated to be 2,000 each M249 LCBSs, if multiple contracts are made or 4,000 each M249 LCBSs if one contract is made.  In addition, it is anticipated that First Article Test quantities, as required, must be furnished as well.  Proposals will be required within thirty (30) days after release of the solicitation.
The expected First Article Test (FAT) is requirement is for ten (10) M249 LCBS, five (5) assembled and five (5) disassembled; one hundred eighty (180) days after contract award. Production deliveries, plus associated Spare Parts, will commence forty-five (45) days after contractor receipt of written Government approval of the First Article Test. 
It is anticipated that production deliveries will start at a rate of 500 M249 LCBSs the first month, ramping up to a rate of 1,100 M249 LCBSs the second month and all subsequent months for the balance of the first Delivery Order (DO).  Any subsequent DO will have its own unique delivery schedule.
Spare Parts are anticipated to be included as a requirement in any subsequent solicitation.  Their quantities and deliveries will be decided upon with each Delivery Order.

<DESC>Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS)Market Survey Announcement
The JM&L LCMC Contracting Center, in support of the Project Manager Soldier Weapons, is seeking sources capable of manufacturing the Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) that provides the capability to remotely aim and fire a suite of crew served weapons. The CROWS is sought for immediate production, fielding and sustainment. 
The system shall be capable of mounting on a variety of existing and future combat platforms. The system shall consist of a remotely operated and fully stabilized weapon station that can mount and operate a variety of crew served weapons including, at a minimum, the Mk19 40mm Grenade Machine Gun, Mk47 40mm Grenade Machine Gun, M2HB 50 cal Machine Gun, M240 7.62mm Machine Gun and the M249 5.56mm Squad Automatic Weapon. The weapon station shall be controlled via a remote display and control grip allowing the operator to slew and point the system in order to view and engage threats in day and night conditions while stationary or on the move. 
Systems shall have robust safety checks and diagnostics built in to assure system safety and must meet U.S. military operational safety requirements. The weapon system shall have the ability to accommodate platform specific traverse and firing inhibits for platform unique characteristics. The weight, power and space claim of the system will be limited to accommodate platform integration of current and emerging requirements.
In support of CROWS manufacturing, sources shall be capable of managing an extensive supplier base to effectively and efficiently provide a flexible production capability that can easily adapt to changes in production rates and configurations. It is anticipated that production rates can vary from 0-100 CROWS/week (may be a combination of new systems and overhauling existing CROWS), depending on the requirements and resources available. In addition to new production, sources shall have the ability to overhaul previously fielded CROWS to include cleaning, repair of broken components, replacement of lost parts, and final inspection. It is expected that sustainment activities for new and existing systems may require some or all of the following: depot repair facility, Field Service Representatives, spare parts, obsolescence management and special tools. Engineering support shall be available, as required, for product improvements, root cause analysis, production support and other activities normally expected for a program of this magnitude. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, the Government would provide the source(s) with a combination of a technical data package, interface control documents, performance specifications (system and selected parts) and other available documentation which will describe the requirements and current CROWS designs. Some or all of this data may be export controlled which may require appropriate approvals to allow Contractors and their suppliers to share part or all of the information required to perform their tasks. At a minimum, field replaceable parts shall be backward compatible to currently fielded CROWS. Software management of CROWS will be the responsibility of the US Government and will not be shared with sources other than the executable code required to operate the CROWS. 
The need and demand for such systems has been significant in the past several years and has the potential to continue in the future. The Government is interested in assessing the engineering and production capability of potential firms/vendors to meet a varying production rate of 0-100/week for systems as well as the necessary engineering services required to support the same. The Government anticipates future contract types to be Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Firm Fixed Priced  Level of Effort (FFP-LOE), and Fixed Price Initiative (FPI) elements.  The anticipated duration would be approximately five (5) years with two (2) additional 1-year options. The estimated total maximum quantity for CROWS is 25,200 over the life of the effort. 
Vendor Questionnaire: The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information from industry to assist in the market research.  Firms/companies are invited to indicate their interest and capability to satisfy the above requirements by identifying the following items:
1.Company Name 
2.Company Address 
3.Company point of contact and phone number 
4.Major partners or Suppliers
5.The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 334511.  With small business size standard of 750 employees. Based on this information is your business considered a small business?

<p>The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price contract, in accordance with FAR Part 13, using simplified acquisition procedures, to Global Health Systems Solutions, Sonara Road, 3 NGEME Street, Limbe, South West, 237, CMR. Global Health Systems Solutions will deliver the following performance work statement.</p>
<p><br />Performance Work Statement<br />Technical Support and Development of Laboratory Management Integration Strategies for Basic Laboratory Information System Pilot in Cameroon<br />I. Background<br />The United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has as its 10 year program goals, to treat at least 3 million people, prevent 12 million new infections, care for 12 million people including 5 million orphans and vulnerable children; and overall health systems strengthening including laboratory services and systems among partner countries. There is evidence that well integrated laboratory services and systems play pivotal roles in the effective implementation of prevention, care, and treatment programs with regards to disease screening, clinical diagnosis, staging of disease, therapeutic monitoring, blood safety, and surveillance. Because of this, the PEPFAR II laboratory indicators clearly lay emphasis on a number of testing facilities (laboratories) with capacity to perform clinical laboratory tests and number of testing facilities accredited. To achieve these goals and indicators within Cameroon, there is the need to put in place a sustainable integrated laboratory capacity that can provide quality, rapid, accurate, affordable and reliable diagnostic and monitoring testing. <br />The United States Government (USG) in collaboration with other regional partners and stakeholders are now engaged in developing and implementing a holistic approach that will guarantee an overall strengthening of the health system. An enhanced laboratory strengthening component that will build in-country capacity to perform clinical diagnostic and monitoring laboratory services, as well as implement Laboratory Quality Management Systems (QMS) and Laboratory Accreditation (LA), is being envisaged within this approach.<br />The International Standard Organization (ISO) 15189 Quality Management Systems (QMS) have been recommended by national, regional, and international accrediting bodies, and is being used world-wide as a special requirement for competence in clinical laboratories. The original concept and process of achieving laboratory accreditation using this and other quality management systems have been seen more as an end product or a shelf purchased commodity that is labor intensive, expensive, discouraging to pursue and identified to be the main reason why most laboratories within Cameroon and other developing countries do not want to be engaged in the implementation of standardized quality management systems and eventual accreditations. However, WHO-AFRO in collaboration with the International Laboratory Branch, Global AIDS Program-Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (GAP- CDC), recently established and launched a more user friendly, slow but steady hill climbing laboratory accreditation process known as the WHO-AFRO &lsquo;'Step-wise'' Laboratory Accreditation Scheme, in accordance with its core functions of setting norms and standards aimed at building institutional capacity to help strengthen the tiered laboratory system.<br />Recent assessment of lab systems in Cameroon shows the lack of an established National Laboratory Strategic Plan that provides a tier-integrated laboratory network with efficient service delivery across various health systems. This lack of a coordinated and referral mechanism greatly affects laboratory capacity to support clinical diagnostic services and systems such as laboratory quality management, accreditation, procurement, equipment maintenance and Lab Information Management System (LIMS). <br />Electronic LIMS have become key components of clinical and public health laboratory infrastructures in developed countries. In resource-limited laboratories in the developing world, such systems are at the early stages of development and adoption. Laboratory specimens, associated patient data, and results are largely managed by non-standardized, paper-based systems that place a record-keeping burden on the laboratory staff and also contribute to a significant degree of errors associated with transcription and workflow issues. Electronic LIMS provide an opportunity to improve laboratory information management practices as a step toward accreditation, but if the system is properly integrated into the laboratory management practices, it can address many of the other laboratory areas including document and record management; management reviews; internal audit; and inventory control and forecasting.<br />In May 2009, CDC and the Computing 4 Good Group at Georgia Institute of Technology (C4G@GT) initiated a collaboration to develop a basic laboratory information system (BLIS) designed specifically for service-delivery laboratories in resource-limited settings. In the first year of the collaboration and through an interactive user-focused process, initial versions of BLIS were developed to address the lab information management needs of laboratorians, lab managers, and Ministries of Health in eight PEPFAR countries. In April 2010, three laboratories in Cameroon committed to a pilot funded by C4G@GT in which BLIS was evaluated in an intensive two-month period that informed further system refinement leading to development of a final and usable version of the system for these laboratories and for laboratories in other countries. <br />CDC/GAP-Cameroon, has engaged in supporting the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) in Cameroon to strengthen the tiered laboratory systems in country to be able to deliver quality laboratory services in support of optimum patient treatment and care. CDC will work in collaboration with the MOPH to provide assistance in implementing the Basic Laboratory Information System (BLIS) to support Laboratory Quality Management Systems (QMS) and Laboratory Accreditation (LA). WHO-AFRO has established this step-wise laboratory accreditation scheme in accordance with its core functions of setting norms and standards aimed at building institutional capacity to help strengthen tiered laboratory systems. In accordance with this scheme, the number of laboratories accredited will be used henceforth as indicators to measure progress made in strengthening laboratory systems in the country. <br />The CDC/GAP-Cameroon is supporting the implementation of BLIS in four pilot laboratories within Cameroon to effectively link the use of electronic LIS and Laboratory Quality Management Systems towards Accreditation using the WHO-AFRO Step-wise scheme. The activities of this SOW will support work to actively engage four pilot laboratories in the WHO-AFRO Step-wise scheme, by addressing the gaps and barriers identified in these labs to achieve Good Clinical Laboratory Practices (GCLP) and to provide mentorship to the laboratories towards accreditation. The SOW covers four pilot laboratories one each from the Center, Littoral, Southwest and Northwest Regions to introduce and implement the step-wise scheme and process in the achievement of the ISO 15189:2003 QMS and accreditation among clinical laboratories within the Cameroon. <br />II. Purpose<br />To implement and evaluate a pilot of the Basic Laboratory Information System in Cameroon to support related efforts to implement Strengthening Laboratory Management Towards Accreditation using the WHO-AFRO Step-wise scheme. <br />III. Scope of Work<br />The vendor will provide all expertise and materials required to complete the tasks outlined below, in accordance with WHO Step-wise Accreditation Scheme and WHO-CDC Guidance for QMS implementation at four pilot sites. The vendor will use accepted techniques that will produce a consistent quality management process, as well as prepare and allow laboratory managers and quality assurance officers to be ready for accreditation. The four pilot sites are Buea Regional Hospital Annex- Buea, SW Region; Regional Hospital Bamenda-Bamenda, NW Region; Laquintini Hospital-Douala, Littoral Region; Central hospital-Yaounde, Center Region. The vendor will require travel or communications with CDC to obtain materials needed to complete the task. <br />All equipment procured to perform the work under this contract shall be the property of the United States Government. <br />The CDC works closely with the NACC/MoPH in supporting HIV/AIDS activities. To ensure a cooperative execution of activities including when support is provided by one or more partners, the MoPH per diem rates and common practice for allowances shall be used for activities under this Statement of Work. <br />IV. TASKS TO BE PERFORMED<br />Tasks will be performed in accordance with the WHO recommended procedures. For each of the four pilot laboratories:<br />Task 1: Provide expert technical assistance in each laboratory to provide on-site services including:<br />&bull; Software setup and training<br />&bull; Performs information-gathering function through site visits, telephone calls and e-mail contact<br />&bull; Provide first line technical support as operational difficulties arise<br />&bull; Interact with C4G@GT to address operational issues, missing functionality or inadequate design and submit a weekly report to the Technical Officer summarizing these interactions.</p>
<p>Task 2: Monitor use of BLIS according to the following pre-defined evaluation metrics: <br />&bull; Efficiency: time for maintaining records<br />&bull; Quality: number of errors due to entering data, turnaround time should decrease<br />&bull; Reporting: the reporting burden for required facility, regional, and national MoPH forms should decrease and the accuracy of these reports should increase.<br />&bull; Data patterns/trends: population/regional surveillance and planning, ability to forecast needs of laboratory<br />&bull; Enthusiasm for BLIS: does this indicator remain high among the staff even after months of use<br />Task 3: Develop, conduct, and support the participants of two user workshops on BLIS for the four laboratories. Participants at each of the workshops are the lab manger and one lab technician who are working with BLIS from each of the four pilot laboratories for a total of eight participants. The workshops will determine the effectiveness of the system itself and define the integration strategy between BLIS and SLMTA. The first workshop will be for three days including travel days to collect baseline information based on experience with the system to date, setting goals, and preparing to report back in the second workshop. The first workshop will be held in Limbe; support to be provided to the 8 participants from each of the pilot laboratories. In addition six other participants will attend from CDC or other partners. One staff from CDC/GAP/ILB and six staff from CDC/Cameroon will attend. The second workshop will be held in October for three days. The second workshop will be to share lessons learned on implementing BLIS and a forum to share how BLIS can be used to make better laboratory management decisions. Support will be provided for the eight participants from each of the pilot laboratories. In addition six other participants will attend from CDC or other partners. Information, recommendations, and suggestions from both the workshops need to be part of the final report. <br />Task 4: Develop, coordinate, and provide the administrative and logistical support for one BLIS Stakeholders Meeting at the end of the six-month pilot period. This will be a one-day high level meeting that will be launched by the Minister of Health. The meeting will focus on laboratory data quality improvement as a part of laboratory accreditation efforts and will involve a data-based evaluation of the six-month pilot in Cameroon. A total of fifty persons will attend including participants from the pilot sites, the MOPH, CDC, and other invited stakeholders.

Massachusetts is one of several Northeast states that has a climate change action plan which calls for significant CO2 emission reductions by 2020.  Integral to that plan is a wider adoption of non-emitting renewable sources of electricity.  Wind power is currently the most practical source of renewable energy to meet that goal.  The Massachusetts' Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requires an increasing amount of the electricity sold in the Commonwealth to come from renewable electricity, including wind power.  RPS is also one of the major policy tools put in place to meet the CO2 reduction goals under the climate change plan.  This project, while small, would contribute towards achieving those goals. The proposed wind turbine is expected to generate an average of 3,000 kW hours of electricity annually.
Lowell National Historic Park, Massachusetts (MA) is proposing to construct a foreign manufactured wind turbine system which consists of two (2) turbines manufactured by Kestrel Wind Turbines, a subsidiary of Eveready LTD and manufactured in South Africa.  The turbines include one (1) Kestrel 1kW HWT and one (1) Kestrel 600W HWT, rated at a peak total power of 16kW DC.  The turbine is approximately 25ft. above the roof of the building, with 20 ft. being the minimum height the turbine can be above any obstruction.  
The output from the two turbines will be combined in a DC load center and routed to a battery bank as well as an optional grid tied inverter.  The interconnection point will be inside the main switchgear  at the end of the buss and will be connected per the 2008 National Electrical Code 690.64B.
The horizontal wind turbine (HWT) system will use a monopole tower system to secure the turbines 40 ft. from the ground level.  
An inverter/charger will convert the DC electricity produced by the wind turbine systems to AC power compatible with the utility grid.  It is a 2.5kWac, 120Vac, one-phase unit that controls the batteries and allows them to be charged by the grid when there are times of little to no wind.  The inverter has been approved by the California Energy Commission (CEC).  Interconnection to the existing building's electrical distribution system will be on the load side of the main service per 2008 NEC 690.64(A), unless otherwise determined.

<DESC>42nd Contracting Squadron proposes to award a contract action to Citizen's Supplies Co. on a sole source basis. A firm-fixed-price contract action is anticipated. The period of performance is 30 Jul 2010 - 12 Aug 10. <br />
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for quotation or a solicitation of offers. Interested parties may provide a Statement of Capabilities to be considered by the agency. If no written responses are received by 13 Jul 10; 4:00 PM CST, the contract action will be awarded without further notice.</p>
<p>Citizen's Supplies Co. currently supports the US Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) Cadet Cultural/Language Immersion Programs. The program's goal is to broaden cadets' understanding of other cultures in an effort to produce a well-rounded officer able to engage in the international arena. The AFROTC intends for cadets to receive immersion exposure in each of the following countries: Indonesia, Egypt, Argentina, Morocco, China, Hungary, Russia and Veitnam. Cultural immersion ensures the cadets have the opportunity to receive immersion by exposing them to the local culture. All instruction for cultural immersion programs must be in English; and all language immersion instruction will be in Arabic. In both cultural immersion and language immersion programs, the cadets should be immersed in culturally significant activities for the majority of the time. These activities should include: military attaches, museums, historical sites, unique topographical features impacting the culture, significant social, ethnic and/or religious focal points, and prominent international businesses, when available. Therefore, it is imperative that Citizen's Supplies Co.'s continued support of the AFROTC Cadet Cultural/Language Immersion Programs be provided to support this mission for Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Citizen's Supplies Co. will provide transportation, meals, lodging, physical fitness and visa processing.</p>

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>A significant rock slide just down river from Kortes Dam in Wyoming has resulted in a complete blockage of the only access road to the dam.  The boulders completely covered the road, took out the guardrail and pushed it into the river along with additional rock debris.  Additional boulders still on the overhanging cliff pose serious threat of additional rock fall and further damage.  River access by boat is extremely dangerous due to high flows to the dam and downstream of the dam.  The only access is by scrambling across the debris field and then walking to the dam.  The overhanging cliff needs to be scaled as quickly as possible to avoid further damage, and rock debris needs to be removed so that personnel are able to safety access the powerplant.  Therefore, it is the intention of the Bureau of Reclamation to enter into negotiations with Moltz Constructors for the purpose of rock scaling, removal of previous rock fall and scaled material, and protection of the North Platte River from scaled and falling rock.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the National Association of Counties Research Foundation (NACoRF), 25 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Suite 150, Washington, DC, to provide services to educate an increased number of rural community leaders with examining their local health systems and identifying economic drivers in their communities.
<p>The purpose is to raise the awareness of NACoRF about the Rural Health Works project by (1) conducting at least one webcast to market the Community Engagement Process (CEP) to NACoRF members, (2) educating rural county leaders and designated CL's to be trained in how to conduct a simplified version of CEP and (3) providing opportunities for technical assistance and peer-to-peer learning about Rural Health Works through NACoRF conferences and publications. NACoRF has developed strategies and working relationship on their own. The NACoRF has a working relationship and ongoing contact with county officials in the rural United States, and at this local level is where they can identify appropriate rural counties in which to demonstrate the effectiveness of the tools developed by the Center for Rural Health Works. NACoRF has developed strategies and working relationship on their own with county health officials in the rural United States. It is at this local level is where they can identify appropriate rural counties in which to demonstrate the effectiveness of the tools developed by the Center for Rural Health Works. NACoRF has well established partnerships, communication strategies and training opportunities for county officials in these rural counties. Because of this existing expertise, it has been determined that the NACoRF is the only organization to provide the required services without substantial duplication of costs. Another entity would have to build those partnerships and communication strategies and develop training opportunities which would be at a substantial duplication of costs to the Government, and not be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>Negotiations with the NACoRF are expected to result in a Contract with a period of performance for one (1) year and four (4) option year periods. NACoRF is deemed the only responsible source capable of providing the required work and service under authority in 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(I). This is not a solicitation. A copy of the solicitation has not yet been produced.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest or submit capability statement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>RECOVERY:  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Materials and Construction Research Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Nikon Metrology, Inc., for the purchase of a large-scale, real-time, laser pseudolite-based tracking system, including two (2) option line items for maintenance service.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  The NIST Construction Metrology and Automation Group of the Materials and Construction Research Division of NISTs Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) requires a large-scale, real-time, laser pseudolite-based tracking system providing sub-centimeter position uncertainty of multiple receivers simultaneously to support experiments in the Intelligent and Automated Construction Job Site (IACJS) testbed.  The IACJS testbed will enable standardized, repeatable testing and evaluation of new construction methods, processes, and information and automation technologies.  It will employ modular packages of sensing, communication, control, and simulation equipment.  For example, the testbed environment will include the ability to measure the position and orientation of construction personnel, equipment, and components with relatively tight tolerances and to integrate that information with outside applications or virtual simulations.  Capturing such performance information is a critical step in the process of developing the enabling measurement science for Advancing Infrastructure Delivery.

The ability to track the position and orientation of multiple objects (or receivers), within a large volume (40 m x 40 m x 7 m), to within a sub-millimeter position uncertainty (250 um), at an update rate of greater than 30 Hz, and to be able to digitize objects within the same work volume using both contact and non-contact optical techniques to the same (or better) level of uncertainty as above is only available using Nikon Metrologys iSpace large volume metrology system and related accessories.  Nikon Metrology does not license any other vendor to utilize their proprietary technology.  Therefore, Nikon Metrology is uniquely qualified to provide the required Laser Pseudolite-based Tracking System.  Nikon Metrology, Inc, is the sole manufacturer and U.S. distributor of the Laser Pseudolite-based Tracking System that is required to satisfy the Governments minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334513, and the size standard is 500 employees.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by July 22, 2010, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>I.	SUMMARY

The Naval Air Systems Command wishes to announce an industry day for the Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) System.  The UCLASS System is envisioned to be a carrier based Unmanned Air System (UAS) with balanced survivability characteristics optimized for Irregular and Hybrid Warfare scenarios.  The UCLASS system is also envisioned to integrate with manned platforms as part of the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) by the end of 2018 to support limited operations in contested scenarios.  The UAS should enhance situational awareness and shorten the time it takes to find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess time sensitive targets.   

Industry day will be held on 05 August 2010 and is anticipated to be an all day event focused on carrier integration and airworthiness certification of an Unmanned Air System (UAS) operating from a CVN-class ship.  This industry day is an informational exchange with industry led by the Navy Program Executive Office for Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons [PEO (U&W)].  This is NOT a Request for Proposals.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  The U. S. Government will NOT assume liability for contractor expenses.  This is an UNCLASSIFIED meeting.  All information discussed must be UNCLASSIFIED. Any information provided or discussed by attendees must not be contractor proprietary or business sensitive information.  Any information or ideas shared during this industry day may be used to develop UCLASS System technical and/or acquisition documents.

<DESC>ERDC Contracting Office intends to solicit sources and pricing  under the authority of FAR 13.500 for for Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) and Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) Binder Testing Services. Sole Source vendor is BURNS ENGINEERING, 551 SUNNYBROOK ROAD, RIDGELAND, MS.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures  --- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than Monday, 7 July 2010 -  11:00 A.M., CDST.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.    Interested parties may submit quotes for consideration by the Government to ellaine.r.james@usace.army.mil.   Technical POC -- mariely.mejias-santiago@usace.army.mil.  Please use solicitation number referenced in the subject line.<BR><BR>This laboratory work is necessary to further critical research.  The Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) is working for the Air force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA), located at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, on an evaluation of WMA technologies for airfield pavements.  The main role of the ERDC in this project is to evaluate WMA technologies through laboratory testing and site visits to develop guide specifications for their use in airfield pavements.  WMA is emerging as the future asphalt paving material because of its multiple benefits, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions and reduced energy consumption.  To better understand the effects of warm mix technologies on the mixture, it is important to evaluate the final binder properties.  To do this, the binder needs to be extracted from the mix and after recovered it is tested to characterize the viscous and elastic behavior at medium to high temperatures through the Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) test (AASHTO 315, ASTM D7175) to determine the high temperature value of the PG grade.  Then, it is tested using a Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) to determine its ability to resist low temperature cracking, which is used to determine the binder's low temperature PG grade value (AASHTO T 313, ASTM D6648).  The ERDC does not have functional DSR or BBR laboratory equipment.<BR><BR>The results of these two tests will give the PG grade of the final binder, which is a product of the combination of virgin asphalt binder, RAP material, and WMA additives.  This work is critical in the characterization of WMA mixtures since it will determine what the final product of mixing virgin asphalt binder, RAP, and WMA technologies at lower temperature is.  Testing service requirements are enclosed.<BR> <BR>Twelve WMA mixes have been selected for the evaluation. The testing of these mixes and reporting of the results is required to be completed by 20 July 2010.<BR>

ROCKY MOUNTAIN NETWORK CONTRACTING CENTER
4100 E. MISSISSIPPI AVENUE, SUITE 610
GLENDALE, CO  80246
	
JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL TO PROCURE
USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Upon the basis of the following justification, the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action is hereby approved pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

JUSTIFICATION

1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.
The Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 1055 Clermont Street, Denver, CO 80220
Rocky Mountain Consolidated Contracting Center, VISN 19, 4100 East Mississippi Ave, Glendale, CO 80246

2.  Nature/description of action.
This activity proposes to solicit sole source with CarePoint Health Care Consultants to provide data analysis for the National VA's Cardiovascular Assessment, Reporting and Tracking (CART) Program at the Eastern Colorado Health Care System. 

3.  Description of Supplies/Services.
Provide a statistician to support the National VA's Cardiovascular Assessment, Reporting and Tracking program directed 
by Dr. John Rumsfeld.

The Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center
1055 Clermont Street
 Denver, CO 80220
Quote: 
Estimated Price = $25,000 ($50/hr)

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications.
The National VA's Cardiovascular Assessment, Reporting and Tracking (CART) system is a software application for standardized report generation, national data repository, and national quality improvement program for VA cardiac catheterization labs. The application is integrated within the VA's EHR, enabling providers to document care as part of routine clinical work.  The application combines discrete data entry (based on ACC data standards) with narrative text for customization.  To minimize data entry, CART-CL automatically incorporates data from the EHR (history, medications, vitals, labs).  CART-CL tracks all Catheterization Lab procedures to accomplish workload capture/coding (i.e. automated CPT/ICD-9 coding).   Therefore, this program requires a master's level statistician with expertise to work with longitudinal databases apps to ensure both quality improvement and quality assurance for CART-CL.  CarePoint Health Care Consultants can provide a statistician with a Master's degree in Statistics, experience with multi-level modeling, discrete time event hazard modeling, continuous time event hazard modeling, and cox regression modeling which is required knowledge for our CART analyses.  Since this is a national program, it requires expertise to identify variables with high missing rates and capture data for multiple imputation methods, propensity scores and propensity matching instrument variables.  They can also provide qualified and experienced personnel in statistical analysis with cross-disciplinary teams between government and academics.  

6.  Description of Efforts to Ensure Soliciting  of as Many Sources as Possible.

Market research through Ability One and Unicor did not yield statistician's resources.  Therefore, the acquisition will be posted on the FedBizOpps web site with the intent to sole-source the service. Questions concerning the procurement's qualification as sole-source procurement can be raised by the public at that time. 

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.
The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on the sole-source availability.   It is imperative that the statistician have experience with the required previously listed statistical applications and modeling and analytical methods.   Otherwise, the additional learning curve cost would be prohibitive.
 The rate of $50/hr is considered a fair and reasonable cost for the proposed services based on similar positions at the VA and  gsa schedules for  SIN 312-51  at 54.93/hr to  $73.73/hr.
 
8.  Description of Market Survey.
The $50 rate is the equivalent contract rate since no benefits are provided with contractors.

9.  Any Other Supporting Data.
There are no other factors supporting the use of other than full and open competition. 
        
10.  Listing of Interested Sources.
CarePoint Health Care Consultants
1621 Pickett Court
Erie, Colorado 80516-7532

11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition.
As this is not a recurring acquisition, there are no actions that may be taken to overcome barriers to acquisition.

Quoters should also complete their Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible Offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, price and price related factors considered. In accordance with the FAR clause 52.212-2, the following information applies: EVALUATION OF OFFERS -USING CAPABILITY TO PERFORM AS MINIMUM CRITERIA, PAST PERFORMANCE AND PRICE FACTORS (APR 1996) (FISC SAN DIEGO) (a) The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers. (i) CAPABILITY TO PERFORM(ii) PAST PERFORMANCE(ii) PRICE(b) Only those Offers which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii). In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is significantly less important than Factor (iii), PRICE. 
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. 
(c) By submitting a signed proposal under this solicitation, Offeror asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract. The contracting officer will validate offerors technical capability to perform by verifying that the offeror has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract. TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria. Under this factor, offers will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the offer to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award. (d) Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance. Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation. Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor. Any Offerors proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:NEUTRAL: No relevant past performance available for evaluation. Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience. Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.OUTSTANDING: No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offerors past performance.SATISFACTORY: Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offerors past performance.MARGINAL: Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offerors past performance.(e) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).(f) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Any questions regarding this solicitation should be forwarded via email to the Contract Specialist at lenette.santana@navy.mil and shall be received no later than 14 July 2010.

<p>(ix) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Award will be made to the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) offeror with satisfactory past performance. <br />The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) Technical. The ratings applied to Technical Capability will be Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. The criteria is met when the Company's Business Plan:</p>
<p>a. Demonstrates an understanding of the support requirements in the customer environment and the ability to provide the expertise and experience to accomplish the required tasks as listed in the Performance Work Statement. <br />b. Shows an ability to quickly respond to emerging long-term and short-term support requirements. <br />c. Explains how airplanes will meet the minimum close air support requirements. (Aircraft records and specifications)<br />d. Explains how the contractor will attract and retain personnel with expertise: pilots with close air support experience, and with the ability to fly training missions in support of Joint Terminal Attack Controller training. (Pilots flight records, resumes, etc.)</p>
<p>(2) Price. The offer will be evaluated on the total price. EURO or US Dollar currency offers will be accepted. The price will be evaluated for fair and reasonableness IAW FAR 15.305(a)(1). The stated exchange rate in AFFARS 5352.225-9004 applies.<br /><br />(3) Past Performance. Past Performance will be evaluated based on subjective assessment of how well the offeror performed on past, recent and relevant work. Offeror must receive a Satisfactory rating to be eligible to receive an award. This rating is based upon offeror-provided information indicating performance of flying (close air support) services as follows:<br />Satisfactory: The offeror has provided information of satisfactory contract performance within the criteria outlined in 52.212-1(b) (10).<br />Unsatisfactory: The offeror has failed to provide information of satisfactory contract performance within the criteria outlined in 52.212-1(b) (10).<br />Unknown: No record of relevant past performance is available. If no past performance is available, the offeror will receive a "Neutral" rating and will not be eligible for award.</p>
<p>The standard for a satisfactory past performance rating is met when the information submitted by the offeror and/or the information found by the government shows:</p>
<p>a. Excellent safety records (Accident free and no loss of life).<br />b. Close communication with customers.</p>
<p>(i) The Past Performance information may be obtained from the following sources:</p>
<p>(A) Reference List</p>
<p>(B) Past Performance Questionnaires</p>
<p>(C) Past Performance Information available from other sources such as Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).</p>
<p>(ii) Past Performance Questionnaire: The contracting officer will evaluate relevant performance information (PPQs) on the lowest priced offeror based on the references provided by the offeror and data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. The assessment process will result in an overall performance rating of Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, or Unknown. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating "unknown", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. A "Satisfactory" past performance rating may be considered more advantageous to the Government than an "Unknown" rating.</p>
<p><br />(4) Award Process: The Government will make award to the technically acceptable, lowest priced offeror with a Satisfactory past performance rating. The Government will first evaluate all proposals for technical acceptability. All technically acceptable or reasonably susceptible proposals will then be subject to past performance evaluation. If the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror's past performance is determined to be "Satisfactory", the evaluation process will stop and the award will be made to that offeror. If the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror's past performance is determined to be other than "Satisfactory", the Government will evaluate the past performance of the next lowest offeror that was rated "Acceptable" for Technical Capability. This process will continue, as needed, until an offeror is rated "Satisfactory" for Past Performance. This offeror will receive the award. If the lowest priced offer with "Satisfactory" past performance is rated "Susceptible to Being Made Acceptable" in Technical Capability, the Government reserves the right to open discussions to determine "Acceptability".</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), United States Coast Guard (USCG), Navigation Center (NAVCEN) is issuing a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, offer(s) being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ and incorporates all provisions and clauses through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) code is 334511 with size 100 employees.

Background

United States Coast Guard (USCG) vessels require updated electronic charts in ELECTRONIC NAUTICAL CHARTS (ENC) and RASTER NAUTICAL CHARTS (RNC) format for their areas of operation, which includes U.S., Canadian, Latin American, and Caribbean waters.  Most electronic navigational charts for the U.S. waters are available from the National Oceanographic Atmospheric Association, National Geo-Spatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) or the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).  Charts for non-U.S. waters will need to be acquired from and produced on the authority of various International Hydrographic Offices.  To support this requirement, the Coast Guard is seeking a contract for the continued monthly distribution updates for charts for these geographic areas, delivered on CD-ROM at set intervals and times, to USCG vessels for use with their navigation systems.  The Coast Guards goal is to ensure that USCG vessels are provided with the most current and up-to-date electronic navigational charts available. By utilizing the services of a commercial contractor who is familiar with both International and United States electronic charting standards, the Coast Guard believes it can more effectively and efficiently provide updated navigational charts to USCG vessels and overcome inconsistencies that can occur from the constant changing of personnel and the broad range of computer skills.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-10-R-DHD548 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-43. This is small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611.
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 3723692, Fax: (202) 475, 3904.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Other deviations from the instructions will be reviewed by the Contracting Officer to ensure that no offeror receives a competitive advantage. Deviations resulting in a competitive advantage for an offeror will result in the proposal being returned to the offeror as noncompliant with the RFP requirements.</p>
<p>15.4.2 All pages in the proposal shall be numbered and identified with the proposal's name (CGC DALLAS (WHEC 716)) Deck Preservation, RFP number, and date of proposal).

"Facsimile proposal," as used in this provision, means a proposal, revision or modification of a proposal, or withdrawal of a proposal that is transmitted to and received by the Government via facsimile machine. <br />(b) Offerors may submit facsimile proposals as responses to this solicitation. Facsimile proposals are subject to the same rules as paper proposals. <br />(c) The telephone number of receiving facsimile equipment is: (510) 637-5978. <br />(d) If any portion of a facsimile proposal received by the Contracting Officer is unreadable to the degree that conformance to the essential requirements of the solicitation cannot be ascertained from the document- <br />(1) The Contracting Officer immediately shall notify the offeror and permit the offeror to resubmit the proposal; <br />(2) The method and time for resubmission shall be prescribed by the Contracting Officer after consultation with the offeror; and <br />(3) The resubmission shall be considered as if it were received at the date and time of the original unreadable submission for the purpose of determining timeliness, provided the offeror complies with the time and format requirements for resubmission prescribed by the Contracting Officer. <br />(e) The Government reserves the right to make award solely on the facsimile proposal. However, if requested to do so by the Contracting Officer, the apparently successful offeror promptly shall submit the complete original signed proposal. <br />(End of provision) <br />52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />2. Price<br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical <br />quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(d) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price type contract for Hotel Accommodations, Conference Space, and Hotel Services located:  Boston, MA.

 Request for Proposal VA-777-10-RP-0077 is in accordance with FAR Subpart 
12.6-Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items.  
This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services or 3rd Party Event Planning Services.  Department of Veterans Affairs will not consider a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel.  An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable.

This announcement incorporates FAR provisions and clauses in effect through FAR 
FAC 2005-32 and VAAR 97-10.  NAICS Code 721110 and the small business size standard is $7M, respectively.  This Federal Business Opportunity announcement/solicitation is solicited unrestricted, and constitutes the only bid document that will be issued.  This solicitation is issued under full and open competition.  This contract will be firm fixed price.

The Period of Performance for this requirement will be August 2-5, 2010.  
The government requires 300 (peak night) sleeping rooms and the required meeting space to be housed in the same facility. The Department of Veteran Affairs, Employee Education System (EES) is sponsoring a training conference on the topic of Medical Home Regional Collaborative-Northeast Region (Learning Session#1). The hotel shall accommodate 300 sleeping rooms (ref CLIN 0001) (based on required time frame), shall provide all requirements specified for conference needs in Parts A, B and C below Lodging rates must be within the Government Per Diem rate or lower for selected area.  

VA travelers shall check in individually and shall pay guest room costs by individual Government credit card.  Hotel shall provide state and local tax exempt forms for VA travelers to submit as this travel constitutes official business of the Federal Government.  A master account shall be established for Group costs (meeting and other room costs in Part B below and food).  

Proposal must allow Department of Veterans Affairs to use their own audiovisual equipment and if there is a cost incurred for connection to hotel sound system with use of own equipment.


TECHNICAL PROPOSAL: A technical proposal shall be submitted addressing the requirements listed and pricing.   Technical proposals should include descriptive literature and commercial list prices of  sleeping rooms, meeting room space, meeting space diagrams and square footage and capacity charts, information (availability/cost) on amenities of hotel, i.e., parking, shuttle services; transportation to/from airport, audio visual equipment and menus, and other amenities offered.  Pricing information in this section is considered to be part of the technical proposal, not the price proposal.

PRICE PROPOSAL:  A price proposal in accordance with the following CLINS must be provided.

To be eligible for award under this solicitation, the hotel facility must propose for use  a facility that is compliant with the requirements of  Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-391) (15 U.S.C. 2201 et.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>This is the Pre-solicitation Notice for the Naval Air Weapons Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) Selectable Output Weapon Industry Day held March 2010. (Reference: Request for Information N6893609R0015). Responses to this Broad Agency Announcement are sought to develop and demonstrate technology that will enable a 500 lb class bomb with 2 or more cockpit selectable output modes using MIL-STD-1760 or other existing aircraft-to-weapon mechanical and electrical interfaces.   Current and planned future Navy, Marine and Air Force manned and unmanned combat aircraft should be considered.  It is envisioned that one output mode will have lethality comparable to the current BLU-111.  It is also envisioned that one output mode will have as small of a collateral damage radius as possible consistent with maintaining a high degree of lethality against a variety of targets including, but not limited to personnel in the open and in buildings and stationary and moving unarmored vehicles! , assuming current Circular Error Probable (CEPs) and Target Location Error (TLEs).  A key element of any technology pursued is that it shall not accidentally function in a higher collateral damage mode than desired or commanded.  It is currently desired that the end product retain the overall aerodynamic shape and mass properties of the existing BLU-111 in order to maintain compatibility with precision guidance kits, JDAM (including Laser JDAM) and LGB, and minimize future integration efforts.  It is highly desired that all explosive material be consumed or other wise rendered safe when the weapon is functioned regardless of output mode selected.  The end product should be consistent with typical weapon design considerations such as Insensitive Munitions, fuze safety (MIL-STD-1316), energetic material qualification requirements (MIL-STD-1751) etc.   The end product should be able to function reliably and safely after environmental extremes encountered during a normal military lifecycle and during normal operating extremes.  The design should be focused to minimize production and lifecycle costs.
A phased approach is required.  Phase I will be a base contract.  Phase II and Phase III are priced options.  Phase I of this BAA will focus on analyses and testing to select or verify technologies and configurations that will meet a variety of potentially competing operational requirements.  For Phase II, the intent is to focus efforts on maturing technologies of the various subsystems required to achieve selectable output and mitigate risk associated with transitioning the technology into the design having the same aerodynamic shape, mass properties and interfaces as the existing BLU-111. The purpose of Phase III is to integrate sub-systems to demonstrate a selectable output 500 pound class bomb with multiple outputs that can be selected by the pilot from the cockpit. This phase is to end with a technology that is at, or above, TRL 6.
This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102 (d)(2). A formal Request for Proposal (RFP)/ Solicitation will not be issued.
The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division (NAWCWD) will not issue paper copies of this BAA. NAWCWD reserves the right to select and fund all, some, or none of the subsequent Proposals received under this BAA.  NAWCWD provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs. Any material submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned. It is the policy of NAWCWD to treat all Proposals as competition sensitive Bid and Proposal Information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation. See enclosed attachment for specific submission and formatting information that must be followed when preparing proposals in response to this announcement. 
Awards to offerors of selected Proposals will be in the form of contracts. Therefore, Proposals submitted as a result of this announcement will fall under the purview of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). 
Questions and Answers:
1-Q) Are detailed costs required for all phases or only the first with ROM's for the other phases?
1-A) The government would like detailed costs for all phases.
2-Q) Can the government supply more detail on the down select evaluation criteria?

3-Q) Does the system require use of FFCS?
3-A) No.
4-Q) Is the government willing to provide IM testing and arena testing as government furnished at government sites?
4-A) No. 
5-Q) When will a complete list of Contract Terms and Conditions be provided?
5-A) At time of award.
6-Q) We assume this is intended to address significant subcontract effort. Is there a definition of subcontractor or is there a threshold value when the lower tier detailed cost proposal must be provided?
6-A) Please refer to FAR 52.204-10.
7-Q) How many days prior to the test will test plan review be complete?
7-A) 7 days.
8-Q) Can the government supply more detail on the relative proposal evaluation criteria of the items listed?
8-A) No.
9-Q)  When will the interface control documents be available? Has the government considered establishing a data library or applicable documents for use of the contractor?
9-A) The Government does not plan to provide Interface Control Documents (ICD's) prior to contract award.  The technical Data Package for a BLU-111 will be made available to successful bidders approximately 1 month after contract award if requested.  An ICD may be developed as the program progresses.  The government does not plan to establish a library.
10-Q)  Are the ORDs for JDAM and LGB available to bidders to assist in understanding environmental requirements?
10-A) The government does not plan to provide the Ordnance Requirements Documents for the Joint Direct Attack Munition or Laser Guided Bomb.  The government plans to develop and share more detailed requirements as the program progresses.  Requirements will evolve and will be refined as the program progresses.
11-Q) Can the government provide a parts list with current Source of Supply for the BLU-111 components?
11-A)  See Attachments 1 and 2 to this amendment. 
12-Q) Does the Government plan to perform the conduct of Phase III arena test at a Government test site utilizing Government personnel to perform test activities?
12-A) The government does not anticipate performing the Phase III arena tests at a Government site or utilizing Government personnel to perform the test.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY.

Preparedness for public health threats is a major goal of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). A severe influenza pandemic has a great potential to cause large numbers of deaths and illnesses over a short time period. A pandemic occurs when there is an antigenic shift in influenza A virus and transmission of a new strain to which most or all of the world's population is susceptible. Three pandemics occurred during the 20th century, the most severe of which, in 1918, caused over 500,000 U.S. deaths and more than 20 million deaths worldwide.  The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, along with recent outbreaks of human disease caused by avian H5, H9, and H7 influenza strains in Asia, Europe, and North America highlight the potential of new strains to be introduced into the population.  Estimates for the next severe pandemic, extrapolating from those of the 20th century, range from about 100,000 to over 2 million deaths in the U.S. alone.

Influenza antiviral drugs and influenza vaccines are considered a primary means to decrease the mortality and morbidity associated with an influenza pandemic. 

The Department of Health and Human Services through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to support advanced stage development of new antiviral agents for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of pandemic and seasonal influenza leading toward submission of a U.S. approval/licensure application and development of required industrial capacity to support implementation of the influenza antiviral drugs at full production capacity at or before the onset of a pandemic.  HHS is particularly interested in the advanced development of new influenza antiviral agents designed to target novel mechanisms of action or to enhance effects of present classes of influenza antiviral agents, formulated for long term stability, long bioavailability, and simple dosing regimens.  Ultimately, these influenza antivirals shall be produced at one or more Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed domestic manufacturing facilities and shall provide sufficient surge capacity to contribute substantially to U.S. and ideally global antiviral drug needs during an influenza pandemic.  

The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of up to five years or 60 months.  Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about August 9, 2010, with proposals being due on or about September 23, 2010.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this internet site (www.fbo.gov ) for the release of this solicitation as well as any amendments.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments via this website.  No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26. All responses should be identified with the RFP number, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice.  Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date of December 30, 2010.

THE SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE IS 10-100-SOL-00016.

<DESC>CHANGE 1, dated 6 July 2010: Revised Attachment 10, Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) List.<BR><BR>CHANGE 2, dated 7 July 2010: Added information concerning instructions for obtaining additional Government Technical Data.<BR><BR>This posting is a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentations (PEO STRI) Synthetic Environment (SE) Core Common Virtual Environment (CVE) Management Program.  The SE Core CVE Management effort focuses on delivering software and limited hardware to enable an interoperable CVE for training of the Warfighters. The ultimate objective of SE Core is to facilitate a virtual training environment supporting mission focused unit training that approximates the changing contemporary operational environment.      <BR><BR>Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2), Army Training Strategies, Army Modernization Programs, Joint/Army Training Doctrine, Joint/Army Battle Command Training Support, and Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) require a fully integrated LVC Training Environment (TE).  The SE Core program is the Armys virtual component of the LVC TE.  SE Core will develop and sustain the Armys CVE which links current and future virtual simulation devices into an interoperable full spectrum training capability. The CVE will connect to gaming training enablers and the live and constructive environments for an integrated LVC TE capability.  <BR><BR>As the Army transitions to a campaign-quality Army with a Joint and expeditionary mindset, our Soldiers require relevant, on demand training available anywhere, anytime, and tailored to their operational training requirements.  SE Core is comprised of complementary efforts for developing the CVE that facilitates fair fight interoperability for virtual system and non-system Training Aids Devices Simulators and Simulations (TADSS).  The program develops operational training terrain databases, models, and simulation architecture connectivity to meet Warfighter operational training requirements.  The terrain and model development efforts provide non-proprietary, open format, and image generator independent CVE deliverables.  The simulation architecture provides an integrated training network.  These efforts, linking current and future virtual training devices/simulations, enables the Army to execute combined arms and joint training, as well as mission planning and rehearsals at home station and at deployed locations. <BR><BR>Since SE Cores system development and demonstration phase, requirements for training and SE Core have grown. SE Core will continue to produce terrain databases, common moving models, the virtual simulation architecture, changes to OneSAF, and common virtual components such as but not limited to After Action Review, Interoperability Gateway, Scenario Generation Tool, and C4I Adapter.  New requirements include but are not limited to: CVE capability management for system and non-system TADSS, mission planning and rehearsal visualization capability, acquisition of terrain source data, development of database centers, SE Core to TADSS plug-in expansion, sound and smell representation, semi-automated forces development and integration, exercise preparation and execution capabilities and definitions for the terms interoperability and fair fight.  SE Core will also facilitate integration and updates concerning OneSAF and SE Core version releases into system and non-system virtual TADSS.  <BR><BR>It is anticipated that the SE Core CVE Management competition will be conducted on an unrestricted full and open competitive basis with best-value tradeoff evaluation procedures.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Class Code is 541512.

<DESC>RE: Questions and Answers on Pre-solicitation Notice W912DR-10-R-0025  Indefinite Delivery Contract for Cost Engineering and Scheduling Services in Support of the Baltimore District Real Property Services Field Office<BR><BR> <BR>Q1.  The RFP states in 1.  Contract Information: One (1) Indefinite Delivery Contract for Cost Estimating, etc&. and another statement, Awards will be for Indefinite Delivery Contracts with a five-year period.  Is there going to be more than one award?<BR><BR>A1.  Only one Contract will be awarded. <BR><BR> <BR><BR>Q2.  Under 2. Project Information, is there a commercially available software in mind for creating the dynamic construction simulations or will the successful proposer be charged with developing a software solution to support the integration of cost schedule, and resource allocations?  <BR><BR>A2.  Software may be commercially available.  We do not have a specific software program in mind. <BR><BR> <BR><BR>Q3.  You have the following statement in 2. Project Information: Projects may include, but are not limited to secure and non-secure data&. And then the following statement in 3(e) Quality Management Plan: This solicitation does not require individuals on the proposed team to have security clearances; only to be U.S. Citizens. When working on secure projects, will cleared individuals be required?<BR><BR>A3.  The only requirement is for U.S. Citizens, no security clearance is required for this requirement. <BR><BR> <BR><BR>Q4.  In 3b, Professional Qualifications: Are the disciplines listed in 1-6 (e.g. Structural), Design Engineering Disciplines or Cost Engineering Disciplines or both?<BR><BR>A4.  Both <BR> <BR><BR>Q5.  The solicitation references FAR Subpart 9.5 Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interests.  Would the following scenarios constitute a conflict of interest under FAR Subpart 9.5?<BR><BR> I.  At the request of USACE Baltimore, a contract holder convenes a VE team of architects and engineers from several design firms in the area to study the Design-Build RFP for a new Medical Center.  Two months later a DB RFP is issued that incorporates in part the VE study team suggestions.  Would the VE team members firms be allowed to be part of teams bidding on the DB RFP?  Would a proposer be ineligible for this contract because they have included in their proposal team member firms that do know a lot of your design work (either in preparation of DB RFP or as part of a responding contractors DB team)?<BR><BR> <BR><BR> II. If a proposer includes on their team architects and engineers from many different firms to serve as team members on tasks under this contract.  And later learns that one of the firms has been involved in the programming, planning, design, cost estimation or analysis of a facility that is the subject of a Task Order under this contract.  Are they in conflict of interest if they: <BR><BR> <BR><BR>a. use that firms personnel on the task or, <BR><BR>b. preclude that firms personnel from working on that task (though they remain a part of the overall consultant team)?<BR><BR> <BR> III. If a firm has been involved in cost estimating, life cycle costing and scheduling services during the master planning of projects at a base in the Baltimore area, would they be unable to perform tasks at later phases in the projects based on that prior involvement either directly serving the USACE or as a sub consultant to an A/E firm?  Would this then make them ineligible for this contract because of prior involvement on one or more installations projects this contract is intended to support? <BR><BR>A5.  All potential conflict of Interest issues or concerns will be addressed as necessary with specific situations.  Hypothetical situations cannot be adequately addressed to give definitive answers. <BR><BR><BR>Q6.  Is this opportunity an ongoing requirement? If so, would it be possible for you to provide me with the name of the vendor who is currently providing these AE services?<BR><BR>A6.  This is a new requirement. <BR> <BR><BR>Q7.  In addition, I understand the requiring office is the Baltimore District Real Property Services Field Office (RSFO). Would it be possible for you to provide me with the name of the Program Officer on this project?<BR><BR>A7.  This solicitation may be utilized for any or all of our programs, so there is no one project manager.  <BR><BR><BR>Q8.  Selection Criteria: Professional Qualifications states that firms must show cost and engineering disciplines; with registration required where applicable for eleven categories.  Is it your intent for firms to show both registered design architects and engineers along with cost engineers that specialize in each discipline?<BR><BR>A8.  Both<BR><BR><BR>Q9.  Past Performance: this criteria asks for past performance of the Design team(s).  Is it your intent that offering firms show past performance preparing Architectural/Engineering design work?  Or, can you clarify what is meant by Past Performance of the design team(s).<BR><BR>A9.  Demonstrate past performance in relation to schedule and cost estimating.  If sub-consultants are used please include past performance where the sub-consultants were part of the team.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>Amendment Two - Request for Information (RFI)M67854-10-R-4828 Additional Industry posted questions to the subject RFI and associated answers.
Q1. Sources Sought Notice Section 2.2 and Purpose and Statement of Objectives for TFSMS Section 9.0:  Indicates an IDIQ with a base year and five option years and the award of initial task orders.  Is it the intent of the Government to receive a ROM for all 6 years or only for the initial Task Order awards as indicated in the Statement of Objectives under Section 9.0 INITIAL TASK ORDERS?A1.  Any RFP resulting from this RFI is anticipated to be a total of 5 years (with options).  The ROM should include just those Task Orders in Section 9.0
Q2. Is it the intent of the government to receive information that is related to Section 3.0 of the Statement of Objectives, or is this a reference to Section 3 of the RFI instructions?A2.  The RFI Section 3.0 pertains to the entire SOO.
Q3. Technical Response (ROM) - Is the desire to have the ROM in hours or dollars?  A3.  The cost is an important aspect in the technical evaluation as is the supporting detail arriving at the cost ROM.  The ROM should be in hours (which ensures we are conveying the correct expected level of effort) and in dollars.
Q4.  If a deficiency is identified in the SOO as part of the technical response, should any associated costs be included in the ROM?A4.  The deficiency should be identified and associated costs for the deficiency clearly provided. 
Q5.  What level of detail is required for the ROM response?  Is pricing at the task order level for the proposed initial task orders and POPs sufficient?A5.  It would be extremely helpful to provide a ROM to the 2nd or 3rd level down (e.g., work breakdown structure) to help us ensure we are conveying the correct expected level of effort.
Q6.  The deliverables list includes a DID for the CPR. This report has five formats and typically two are required and 3 are optional. Which formats will be required?A6.   It is envisioned formats 1, 2 and 5 will be required.
Q7.  What is the anticipated place of performance?A7.  Development, testing and eventually COOP will be at the Contractor's facility while Production is in Diamond Hall, Marine Corps Base, Quantico.
Q8.  In Section 3.4 of the RFI requirements, it is stated that we should provide information in response to Section 3.0 of this RFI. Section 3.0 does not appear to be the correct section. Please clarify which section should be referenced.A8.  Section 3.4 is a part of Section 3.0.  Section 3.0 addresses the due date, the format of the response, response requirements and the technical response requirements.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION:  The Indefinate Delivery/Idefinate Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order No. DE-AT30-07CC60011/SL14 is a Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) Small Business Set-Aside awarded to C/P/E Environmental Services, LLC. The Task Order is receiving additional American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding in the amount of $3.875 million dollars to remediate waste volumes in excess of the original assumptions. The waste volumes are to be remediated within the existing ARRA scope which includes the acceleration of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) Environmental Remediation Project. The current scope includes soil investigations, feasibility studies, remedial action plans, remedial design, soil removal actions and treatment system construction, start-up, and testing.
Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:
The work is characterized as an environmental remediation project. The nature of the work requires some flexibility to accomplish. Therefore, it would not be feasible to award a fixed price award for this effort.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION. FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DUNS 007113228. The modification addresses the following work:
<p>These funds will be used for:</p>
<p>&bull; Supplement entitled "Mesh Generation for Modeling and Simulation of Carbon Sequestration Processes" to existing Advanced Scientific Computing Research-Computational Partnerships (SciDAC) project "Interoperable Technologies for Advanced Petascale Simulations" to support collaborative research with Basic Energy Sciences (BES)-supported Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) to develop a high-performance computing capability relevant to the goals of the EFRC. ($600,000) <br />&bull; Supplement entitled "Algebraic Multigrid Methods for Modeling and Simulation of Carbon Sequestration Processes on Multicore/GPU Architectures" to existing SciDAC project "Toward Optimal Petascale Simulations (TOPS)" to support collaborative research with BES-supported EFRCs to develop a high-performance computing capability relevant to the goals of the EFRC. ($1,113,880)</p>
<p><br />The action is other than fixed price because work assigned to the Sandia Corporation through the issuance of Work Authorizations (WAs) is pursuant to the terms and conditions of their prime management and operating contract awarded under as a cost reimbursement type contract due to the uncertainties in contract performance. Cost cannot be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract as the exact nature and duration of the work is uncertain. The use of a separate fixed price award to Sandia Corporation for the WA is inappropriate because this is issued under an existing cost reimbursable contract. Sandia was selected by the Department of Energy (DOE) to participate in this American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) work due to the expertise at Sandia National Laboratories in the subject matter. The work falls within the prime contract's Statement of Work, paragraph 3.5, entitled "Computing, Modeling, and Simulation" that states: "The Contractor shall maintain state of the art technologies and capabilities to support high-performance computing, modeling, simulation; communications; cyber-security, and information management. The Contractor shall participate in the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative, the Advanced Computational Technology Initiative, the Strategic Simulator Initiative, and other associated research on complex and large-scale national problems in computational science ."</p>
<p>NOTE: This action is awarded under prime contract modification no. 386 that recognizes Work Authorization no. KJ/AL08/0/ARRA- 1,-2 issued under M&amp;O Contract number DE-AC04-94AL85000. This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars.</p>

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>FA3002-10-D-0010
<DESC><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p><br />I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p>Department of the Air Force, Air Education and Training Command, Contracting Squadron,<br />AETC CONS/LGCI, 2021 First Street West Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4302.</p>
<p><br />II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED</p>
<p>This action will be awarded as a new contract. This Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) is being issued to gain approval to award a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity bridge contract to continue services for C-17 training for a period of 12 months, 1 July 2010 - 30 June 2011. This bridge has become necessary as a result of a delay in the source selection (RFP# FA8621-10-R-6260) for the follow-on USAF C-17 training contract being procured at the C-17 Training System Product Group Contracting Office, ASC/YWM at Wright Patterson AFB, OH which will cover both USAF and FMS service requirements. The existing Foreign Military Sales (FMS) C-17 training contract (FA3002-05-D-0006) expires 30 June 2010, as all option periods including the six months extension of services, have been exercised. A 12-month bridge contract is necessary to meet Air Force Security Assistance Training's (AFSAT's) requirements for FMS C-17 aircraft training until a follow-on, competitive contract can be awarded which provides coverage for both USAF and FMS students as mentioned above. Under the contemplated contract for FMS, the period of performance will contain a 3-month basic period followed by three quarterly options to coincide with the bridge being utilized for USAF students. The requirements document from the existing C-17 training contract (FA3002-05-D-0006) will be used for this bridge contract.</p>
<p><br />III. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>Under the contemplated contract, The Boeing Company, the incumbent service provider, will furnish C-17 aircraft related training and technology transfer services, as well as ancillary equipment and software, for multiple international FMS customers. Services include, but are not limited to a combination of prepared classroom studies, computer-based self-study, and hands-on practical application. It includes initial and continuation training for pilots, loadmasters, and maintenance technicians. The service provider also provides special skills training, such as air-refueling, airdrop, firefighter/rescue, instructor training, and incidental maintenance training. The total estimated value for the identified performance period of 1 July 2010 through 30 June 2011 is $1,919,037.50. An estimated quantity of over 1,000 students will require training during this period. Service provider training and services will be paid for with FMS funds with appropriation 9711X8242.</p>
<p><br />IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.&emsp;<br />V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE</p>
<p>FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A) contains the applicable statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for the contemplated contract action. This reference reads "Services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in - (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition." Per the requiring activity, utilizing historical data, in order to train 10 instructors to teach C-17 aircrew courses in support of international customers it costs on average $750K, and validating the instructors' qualifications over a 6-month period can increase the total cost to &gt; $2M. The acquisition or re-creation of C-17 technical data packages and software under contracts with other service providers would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Boeing is the incumbent service provider for C-17 training services, (Contract #FA3002-05-D-0006) and owns the technical data packages and C-17 software. This contract was non-competitively awarded on 10 December 2004 to Boeing, to maintain continuity and standardization for operations with the training provided in the USAF contract awarded at the C-17 Training System Product Group Contracting Office, ASC/YWM at Wright Patterson AFB, OH. Boeing is in place and is providing these services without the need for a transition.</p>
<p>FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B) contains the applicable statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for the contemplated contract action. This reference reads "Services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in - (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements." The Government estimates the time required to compete this bridge requirement (including time required to evaluate the proposal and determination of technical acceptability), coupled with the time needed to bring a new service provider up to full performance level would result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency's requirements. The incumbent is the only available source to immediately continue this service during the interim period without mission degradation. Boeing is uniquely qualified and well experienced at supplying this type of highly specialized training and ancillary training support services. Boeing is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the sole developer of the C-17 aircraft. There are no other current contract vehicles to facilitate the use of another source. Standardization and interoperability of C-17 flight and maintenance operations is a significant safety concern for the U.S. Government and for international C-17 customers. This interoperability contributes heavily to the success of on-going C-17 airlift operations in the Middle East and around the world. Boeing's continued role as the training provider for FMS C-17 customers ensures there will be no reduction in the level of standardization or interoperability among C-17 fleets participating in coalition and other operations. This in turn enhances C-17 flying and maintenance safety, help avoid accidents, and possibly save lives. Additionally, the Air Force does not have the organic resources necessary to meet these mission requirements and must have continued contract support; the potential damage to the government is significant and will result in serious injury to the daily operations of AFSAT's ability to provide requested training services to international C-17 customers.</p>

<p>A synopsis of this requirement indicating the Government's intention to award a firm-fixed price bridge contract on a sole source basis to the current service provider was posted to the GPE (FEDBIZOPPS website) on 09 April 2010. The Government required all interested persons to identify to the Contracting Officer their intent and capabilities to satisfy the Government's requirement within 15 days after the date of publication of the synopsis. Responses were due by 26 April 2010. The Government did not receive any responses (other than the incumbent) that addressed a company's intent or its capabilities to satisfy the Government's requirement by the due date.</p>
<p><br />VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer concluded that none of the Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA) exceptions in FAR 15.403-1(b) apply. Therefore, certified cost or pricing data are required. Cost analysis shall be used to evaluate the reasonableness of individual cost elements when cost or pricing data are required in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(a)(3). Price analysis will also be used to verify that the overall price offered is fair and reasonable. The Contracting Officer may request a technical analysis IAW FAR 15.404-1(e) and/or field pricing assistance IAW FAR 15.404-2(a). Detailed documentation will be accomplished in the Price Negotiation Memorandum to ensure that the final agreed-to price is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS</p>
<p>As described in Section VI above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties. The Government has determined, based on the market research conducted that no companies other than the incumbent are able to satisfy the Government's needs and the bridge contract will be awarded as a non-commercial item; therefore, certified cost and pricing data shall be obtained IAW FAR 15.403-4. This current acquisition is meant as a stopgap measure to continue the current services until the award of the follow-on contract.</p>
<p><br />IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>Failure to continue performance with Boeing would result in devastating disruption to the daily operations of AFSAT's ability to provide requested training services to international C-17 customers. The development and implementation of classroom study material entails use of proprietary information. The hands-on portion of the training services requires use of equipment produced under the prime contract.&emsp;<br />X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION</p>
<p>The Boeing Company<br />6200 J.S. McDonnell Blvd<br />P.O. Box 516<br />Saint Louis MO 63134-1939</p>
<p><br />XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>A competitive acquisition is currently underway to provide future C-17 services at the C-17 Training System Product Group Contracting Office, ASC/YWM at Wright Patterson AFB, OH, with a base period of 12 months followed by four, 12-month option periods. The anticipated award date for this competitive acquisition is December 2010.</p>
<p><br />XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that he has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his knowledge and belief. The proposed Bridge Contract is in the best interests of the United States government, its allies, and C-17 customers.</p>
<p><br />XIII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>As evidenced by the signatures on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical/requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete. The supporting data that forms the basis of this justification has been certified accurate by the appropriate management level of the technical/requirements organization.</p>

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>FA9401-10-C-0025
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The 377th Civil Engineer Group, Kirtland Air Force Base (Albuquerque) NM 87117 requires a bridge contract to succeed contract F29650-00-D-0002 which expires on 31 Mar 2011. The bridge contract will consist of a six (6) month basic period of performance with two (2) one-month options. The AFNWC/PKOC (formerly 377 Contracting Squadron) intends to make an award to Chugach Management Services, Joint Venture (CMSJV), 3800 Centerpoint Drive, Ste 601, Anchorage, AK 99503. Interested parties may e-mail susan.mcdaniel@kirtland.af.mil or fax 505-846-5744, Attn: Susan McDaniel, not later than 14 Jul 2010, 3:00 p.m. MST.
<p>IAW FAR Part 5.207-15(c) (ii), the proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one (1) source under the authority of FAR 6.302. All interested parties may identify their interest and submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the government. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements, proposals or quotations received within five (5) business days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Interested parties must clearly demonstrate in the submitted documents that there will be no service interruptions and no added investment and start-up costs associated with award of a bridge contract to any contractor other than the incumbent contractor.&emsp;Documentation submitted will not exceed five (5) pages and will be submitted electronically to the cognizant Contracting Officer listed in the first paragraph above. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) <br />CMSJV is the only company with the personnel, tools, equipment, vehicles, and materiel mobilized to perform these services which are essential and mission critical to Kirtland Air Force Base (AFB), it's nuclear surety mission, mission partners and the base population without a lapse in service or a duplication of significant capital investment (Vehicles/equipment $14,473,968.00, includes inflation for FY11) and start-up (transition-in, $367,255.00) costs. Any contractor except CMSJV would, of necessity, experience investment or start-up costs for this large operation, and the government would not recover such costs through competition of the bridge contract simply because of the extremely short contract term.<br />As the incumbent for the past ten (10) years, CMSJV appears to be the only contractor who is fully knowledgeable of the requirements and level of effort required to meet the needs of the base population to sustain the level of service required and ensure no Notice of Violations are received for failure to meet all federal and state regulations and requirements. This is important because Kirtland AFB has to provide a safe, secure and healthy environment to support the nuclear surety mission, as well as the Kirtland mission partners, and residents, while supporting the War Fighter, without any interruption of critical infrastructure services.<br />Changeover from the current contract with CMSJV to a bridge contract with CMSJV will be transparent to Kirtland AFB in terms of contractor performance. Award of the bridge contract to another contractor will not produce seamless performance. The result would be degradation of Kirtland AFB's nuclear surety program and an interruption of services which Kirtland AFB cannot absorb and still meet its peacetime and wartime missions.</p>
<p>In summary, several contractors can perform these services on a long-term basis as the October 2009 sources sought indicates; however, there is only one (1) contractor (CMSJV) who appears to be capable of performing these services on a short-term basis (i.e., bridge contract) with no service interruptions and without added investment and start-up costs.&emsp;</p>

<AWDNBR>SPM20004D7519
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p><br />1. The Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Medical Supplier Operations Directorate is the contracting activity.</p>
<p>2. The action being approved is the ability to solicit for DLA requirements on an other than full and open competition basis. This justification is for a third bridge contract which will ensure the continuation of the optical Electronic Catalog (ECAT) contract currently held by Rochester Optical under contract SPM200-04-D-7519, which expired May 4, 2010. The proposed 240-day bridge contract will provide support and accessibility for the Military Services until a follow-on contract can be awarded.</p>
<p>3. The item required to meet the needs of the optical ECAT customers under this action is:</p>
<p>Item: Carrier, Lens Ophthalmic (also referred to prescription lens carrier (PLC))<br />NSN: 6540-01-264-1348</p>
<p>The realistic estimated dollar value of the 240-day bridge contract is $750,000.00. This figure is based on the current annual sales of delivery orders placed through the ECAT Program, and an additional six percent to cover the increase in new summer recruits. The maximum dollar value of the bridge contract is $1,500,000.00.<br /><br />4. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is<br />10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5. The use of this authority is necessary because the follow-on contract for the carrier, lens ophthalmic in support of the Military Services has been delayed due to unresolved technical issues. In addition, this office has reached the maximum dollar value of the second bridge contract and, as a result, orders are currently being placed through Direct Vendor Delivery.</p>
<p>The carrier, lens ophthalmic is necessary for all Military Service personnel who wear prescription vision correction lenses and use Ballistic Laser Protective Spectacles (BLPS) and the M40 gas mask. It is issued to recruits during Basic Training and is a critical go-to-war item issued to all troops scheduled for deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>6. In accordance with FAR 5.201(b)(1)(i), the proposed bridge contract will be synopsized in FedBizOpps. In addition, this justification will be made available for public inspection, after award, in accordance with FAR 6.305.<br /><br />7. As the Contracting Officer, I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to <br />the Government will be fair and reasonable as the current price will continue<br />to be offered under the proposed third bridge contract. Further, the current price was determined fair and reasonable at time of award based upon the receipt of adequate price competition.</p>
<p>8. Market research indicates that because of the use of the unique Government- furnished mold, Rochester Optical is the only vendor capable of performing on the proposed contract since the vendor currently has a production line set-up and raw materials in place to perform on this contract. It has been determined that Rochester Optical is the only known manufacturer who has the capability of providing the required item in the required timeframe.</p>
<p>9. Rochester Optical is the only source that has expressed an interest in the proposed bridge contract.</p>
<p>10. The follow-on acquisition was solicited as a total small business set-aside. Responses to our market research indicate that there were several small businesses interested in and capable of fulfilling this requirement. It is anticipated that all future acquisitions for these requirements will be competed on a full and open competition basis restricted to small business participation.</p>
<p>11. As the Contracting Officer, I hereby certify that the information contained in this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<DESC>Military Sealift Command has bilaterally executed modification P00200 to contract N00033-82-C-1019 for the operation and maintenance of USNS SGT MATEJ KOCAK. This modification extends the contract period by 135 days, until November 15, 2010. This extension is necessary due to GAO protests in response to the award of a contract under a competitive follow-on procurement. The protests resulted in a stay of performance that prevent the follow-on contractor from&nbsp;providing the contracted services.&nbsp;The current contract period of performance was previously scheduled to end on July 03, 2010. A lapse in service would have occurred without the modification to extend, and an insufficient amount of time remained prior to contract expiration for a competitive procurement of services to bridge the performance gap.

Justification and Approval 


1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity  

VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System, Contracting Office, Biloxi, MS, proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition for Social Work Services.


2.	Nature/Description of Action

A new firm-fixed priced requirements contract for Homeless Transitional Services which is currently being provided under Fee Agreement with Harbor House is being contemplated as authorized under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 17.48.  


3.	Description of Supplies/Services

The requirement is to provide emergency housing to Veterans along with other services to assist them in transitioning back into the community.  Ten (10) beds are intended to be utilized for these services. The transitional housing is for a period of 6 months or 180 days. Historically, Harbor House has reported that the ten beds have not been fully utilized and that the most they have assisted is four to six.


4.	Identification of Statutory Authority

( X )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)   Only One Responsible Source
(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2)   Unusual and Compelling Urgency
(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (3)   Industrial, Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental, or                                                                                                          
                                           Research Capability or Expert Services
(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (4)   International Agreement
(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (5)   Authorized or Required by Statute
(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (6)   National Security
(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (7)   Public Interest


5.	Rationale in support of citation in Paragraph 4 above:

a.	Description of contractor and or of acquisition action that demonstrates that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:

In accordance with the above listed authority and as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Harbor House is the only known operational Homeless Transitional Services facility in Pensacola, FL where the services are required.


b.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practical:

      A Sources Sought Notice was issued 1 March 2010.  One SDVOSB showed interest but his establishment is in Port Charlotte, FL and he would not set up new operations in Pensacola unless given a contract first.  Because the VA would need to inspect a contractor's actual proposed facility as part of the solicitation's evaluation factors, this would be impossible to accomplish as the potential Offeror does not currently have established operations in Pensacola. Further market research through Internet sources revealed that there are no other established Homeless Transitional Service providers in Pensacola.

c.	If the Sole Source Exception (c) (1) was chosen, state the date of synopsis or the     basis for waivers.

A Sources Sought Notice issued 1 March 2010 revealed only two interested companies.  One is the "Incumbent" who currently provides services under a Fee Agreement and the other is a SDVOSB who currently does not have operations in the Pensacola, Florida area.  Executive Order 13360, therefore, is not required as the SDVOSB is not currently available.  
  
d. If the Urgency Exception was chosen and this J&A was prepared after the procurement action was carried out, state the reasons.

N/A

      The above acquisition will be negotiated with:

N/A


6.	Determination of a Fair and Reasonable Cost

The Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable because a complete analysis of all costs or a price analysis will be fully utilized prior to award of the contract. 

7.	Description of market survey and any interested sources. If no market survey was conducted, state the reason.

A Sources Sought Notice issued 1 March 2010 revealed only two interested companies.  One is the "Incumbent" who currently provides services under a Fee Agreement and the other is a SDVOSB who currently does not have operations in the Pensacola, Florida area.  The Executive Order 13360 therefore is not required as the SDVOSB is not currently available.  
8.	Additional Support for the use of other than full and open competition:

a. Explanation of why technical data, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work or purchase descriptions suitable for full open and competition have not been developed or are not available:

N/A

b. When the sole source exception is used in the case of a follow-on acquisition, provide an estimate of the cost that would be duplicated and describe how the estimate was derived if the contract is awarded to other than the incumbent:

Current amount paid per Veteran is $40 per day to Harbor House under a Fee Agreement.  It is believed that Harbor House will seek a higher amount due to our failure to fill all ten beds and also due to changes in the economy.  Prices of similar nature will be obtained from other VA's to determine a fair and reasonable price before award is made.


c. When the urgency exception is cited provide the data, estimate of cost or other rationale as to the extent of harm to the government if the contract is not awarded expediently:

N/A


9.	Sources expressing an interest:

Harbor House, Pensacola, FL (Current provider under Fee Agreement)

Halcyon Management Group,Lighthouse Addiction Services, Port Charlotte, FL (SDVOSB)


10. Actions, if any, being taken to remove barriers to full and open competition:

We will continue to maintain contact with Halcyon Management Group to see if they establish operations in Pensacola, FL.  We will also continue to monitor the market through FedBizOpps and through the Social Work Services who work in the Pensacola area to determine when new companies enter the marketplace.

11. Delivery Requirements:

Base Period: June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2011
1st Option Period: June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012
2nd Option Period: June 1, 2012 through May 31, 2013
3rd Option Period: June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2014
4th Option Period: June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2015

12.  Acquisition Plan: An Acquisition Plan   (  ) is ( X ) is not required for this acquisition.

13. IT Approval: IT Approval (  ) is (X) is not required for this acquisition. If it is, include appropriate approvals.
