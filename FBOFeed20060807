<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Security and Safety Performance  Assurance, SSA intends to extend the period of performance of contract  number  DE-AC01-04SO20188 with CSC Systems & Solutions LLC hereinafter, CSC on a  sole  source bridge basis to provide uninterrupted support while a new  procurement is  competed that will replace the CSC contract.  See FedBizOpps Synopsis  number  DE-RI01-06SA00002 issued on July 25, 2006.  The extension will continue  the  performance period for six months and shall include 2 three-month option  periods.  The extended period of performance will be from September 22,  2006  through March 21, 2007.  The first three month option period starts March  22,  2007 and the second three month period starts June 22, 2007.  This extension is being made noncompetitively based on the exclusion found  at  Federal Acquisition Regulation,FAR 6.302 1 a, which authorizes other than  full  and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no  other  supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements within the required  time-frame. To DOEâ€™s knowledge and belief, only CSC has the requisite  number of  Q cleared personnel with the highly specialized technical experience to  ensure  that the SSAâ€™s requirements are met within the required delivery  schedules. No  other firm has the requisite knowledge, experience and capability to  assume the  critical, highly specialized technical support without interruption. The present contract with CSC ends on September 21, 2006; THERE ARE NO  SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE FOR THIS REQUIREMENT. Interested,  responsible  sources may submit information regarding their capability to perform this  requirement, which shall be considered by the Department. Information  received  will be considered for the purpose of determining whether or not to  conduct a  competitive acquisition.  CSC currently provides specialized technical, analytical and  administrative  support services in support of: a - the development, revision, review and  production of classification and control guidance; b- the development,  revision, and review of policy and procedures, including supporting  appraisals  of the Departments classification and controls programs; c- support in the  development of education coursework and the provision of training related  to  classification and control requirements; and d- general administrative,  file  room, and mail room management support involving classified materials. All  support provided is required to be in accordance with DOE Order 471.1A,  Identification and Protection of Unclassified Controlled Nuclear  Information;  DOE Manual 470.4-4, Information Security; DOE Manual 475.1-1A, Identifying  Classified Information; the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,  including  implementing regulations; the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, including  implementing regulations; Executive Order 12958, Classified National  Security  Information, as amended, including implementing regulations; 32 Code of  Federal  Regulations, CFR Chapter XX, Information Security Oversight Office,  National  Archives and Records Administration; 10 CFR Part 1017, Identification and  Protection of Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information; and 10 CFR Part  1045, Nuclear Classification and Declassification.  The level-of-effort for the six-month extended period of performance is  38,030  Direct Productive Labor Hours, DPLHâ€™s and 19,015 DPLHs for each of the 2  three-month option periods.  The estimated ceiling price for the six-month  period of performance is $ 2.8 million. It is estimated that the  level-of-effort will require approximately 42 full-time equivalent  personnel:  Key personnel: one Program Manager; one Senior Technical Analyst; one  Senior  Policy Analyst; and one Senior Trainer.  Non-key personnel: Policy  Analysts,  Technical Analysts, Administrative Assistants, Training Specialists, File  Room  Clerks, Document Reviewers, File Room Supervisors, Security Assistant, and  Training Assistant.  All personnel performing under this effort are required to possess a  current  DOE Q access security clearance.  Personnel supporting the policy and  procedures effort are required to have a high level of expertise relative  to  classification/declassification and unclassified controlled information  policy.  Technical personnel supporting the classification and controls effort are  required to have specialized nuclear-related classification experience,  and  must be authorized Derivative Classifiers, Derivative Declassifiers or  Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information, UCNI Reviewing Officials.

BACKGROUND. The Supplemental Allocation provided in the 2207 Report and the Iraq Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) Program Management Office (PMO) has been initiated to design, develop, produce, and deploy services, products, and construction to support rebuilding the infrastructure and economy of Iraq. The rail system is an integral part of the infrastructure rebuilding and improvement efforts to move goods, people, and raw materials supporting inter-state and international commerce and exchange.  To support this effort, proper maintenance of the country's rail system is essential.  The mobile wheel reprofiler and associated lifting columns (jacks) are an integral part of this in-country rail maintenance capability.  This capability is essential to the efficient movement of materials between sea ports, rail heads, and truck carriers.  The mobile wheel set reprofiler specification is a commercial rail bed maintenance equipment specification.  The desired equipment must meet the MOBITURN specifications.  APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS.  All applicable international standards for rail wheel set reprofiling tolerances and dimensions (UIC), and those established and required by the Iraq government for the IRR safe operations.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the manufacture of the Overhead Window Severance Assembly Frangible Bolt in accordance with the requirements of the attached Statement of Work (SOW) and the attached SKD26100117 document, "Design and Performance Specification for Frangible Bolts, Orbiter Overhead Window Severance." Statement of Work can be viewed at:   http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/NNJ06163034Q/sow.doc  Specifications can be viewed at:   http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/NNJ06163034Q/Specifications.pdf   NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from SPS Technologies.  The Space Shuttle Orbiter uses the Bolt for flight crew escape.  The Johnson Space Center (JSC) has been assigned responsibility for logistics management, manufacture, and certification of these units.  These Bolts are not produced on a regular basis since these are used only during crew escape scenarios.  The Bolts currently installed in the Orbiters must be exchanged during the periodic replacement of the Overhead Window Severance Assembly.  Enough Bolts shall be purchased in this procurement to cover the current estimated flight-life of the Orbiters. The Bolt was qualified for Manned Spaceflight over 20 years ago and has only been procured a few times.  Currently the only available source qualified to produce flight certified Bolt per the NASA specification SKD26100117 (Design and Performance Specification for Frangible Bolts, Orbiter Overhead Window Severance) is SPS Technologies, in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to award a non-competitive, six month follow-on modification to contract No. 521-C-00-05-00038-00 with the Centre de Formation et d'Encadrement Technique (CFET) awarded in February 2005.  The purpose of the modification is for the continued provision of specialized services to the Government of Haiti in which the contractor will continue to recruit, hire, monitor and pay individual consultants for the Government of Haiti (GOH).  These Ministry-level consultants have been an essential component of the U.S. Government’s institutional strengthening support to the GOH.  While progress has already begun to take shape within Haiti’s first multi-party, legitimately-elected government, GOH institutions remain weak, and the expectation of citizens on newly-elected officials to meet their basic needs and facilitate political, social and economic inclusion is high.  Immediate actions need to be taken to link the electoral success of President Préval and the new Parliament to tangible, highly-visible improvements in services and infrastructure.  In order to support GOH effectiveness, build legitimacy, reinforce operational capacity, improve transparency and accountability and deliver high-impact, visible results, it is essential that the GOH has the support of highly-qualified experts to advise them on both policies and priority programs.  The proposed follow-on modification comes at a critical time and will immediately enable the U.S. Government to increase the services provided by the contractor to continue to support the GOH without a break in activities.  This support helps to achieve a principal U.S. foreign policy objective in Haiti and will focus on providing limited commodities and technical assistance to the following entities:  the Ministry of Commerce for help with the Investment Facilitation Center and to increase Haiti’s ability to comply with international trade agreements; the Ministry of Public Works to support work in the telecommunications industry; the Ministry of Tourism for increased tourism in targeted destinations; the Office of the President to provide high level economic advice. 

A modification of the existing contract is expected under the authority in AIDAR 706.302-70 (5),  Other than Full and Open Competition, unless the Contracting Officer determines that more than one source can meet the U.S. Government’s needs as a result of this notice.  To respond to this notice and be considered, offerors must see Numbered Notes 22 and 25 and must strictly comply with the submission instructions and requirements.  All responsible sources may submit an expression of interest in accordance with the submission instructions and requirements stated above.  USAID/Haiti will not respond to requests nor consider proposals that do not comply with the submission requirements.  It is the sole responsibility of offerors to ensure that their expressions of interest and all necessary documents reach the Office of Acquisition and Assistance, USAID/Haiti; 17, Harry Truman Boulevard, Port-au-Prince, Haiti, not later than 15 days from the date of this notice and before the USAID/Haiti close of business.

<DESC>The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) has a requirement for the design, implementation, and maintenance of a customized off-the-shelf web-based advanced reservation and timed pass system for the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC). The purpose of the system is to better manage demand and improve the visitor experience for Capitol tours, the new visitor center, and orientation theatres. This new advanced reservation and timed pass system will be utilized at on-site reservation booths, will-call windows, and a web-based reservations site. The Contractor will not be required to operate a reservation or call center office. The Contractor shall work with CVC staff to complete the following components of work: (1) Provide identified system development life cycle documentation; (2) Develop and/or customize advanced reservation and timed pass web-based system to fit requirements outlined in this document; (3) Create, host, and maintain reservation system web site; (4) Adhere to system performance measures; (5) Assist with the procurement and installation of necessary on-site equipment and insure system compatibility; (6) Assist with and oversee operator/user training and system testing and implementation; (7) Monitor system performance and adjust system as needed to meet requirements; (8) Maintain and secure system data; and (9) Provide ongoing system technical support, including operating customer and operator trouble phone lines. 

It is anticipated that AOC will purchase licenses for use of the contractor-owned system, semi-customized to meet CVC requirements. Though the typical fee structure for a reservation system is based on a per transaction or per reservation fee, the fee structure for this requirement should be based on concurrent users. A per transaction fee is not appropriate as there will be no charge for the timed passes or the advance reservations. Offerors must be able to provide a firm fixed-price for the licensing agreement based on an expected peak volume of concurrent users, based on their experience and the projected visitor volumes to be included in the solicitation. 

The implementation of the reservation and timed pass system should align with the opening of the CVC. 

This solicitation is unrestricted (that is, full and open competition). Offers will be evaluated on a Best Value basis. Offerors may be requested to provide a demonstration of their proposed software solution. Proposal details will be included in the solicitation. We will issue a Request for Proposals in the form of a solicitation which will include a description of the work requirements, instructions to offerors, and required certifications. WE ESTIMATE THAT THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ON AUGUST 17, 2006 at http://www.aoc.gov/business/procure-opps.cfm. INTERESTED PARTIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO DOWNLOAD THE ELECTRONIC VERSION, AS THIS WILL EXPEDITE RECEIPT OF THE SOLICITATION. It is the Vendor's responsibility to monitor this web site for amendments, or other changes to the solicitation, and obtain the amendments from the AOC Internet site. Failure of the vendor to do so shall not become the responsibility of the Government. Requests for hard copies of the solicitation package must be submitted in writing to Caryn Rotheim, Contract Specialist, via Fax No. (866) 221-2139 or e-mail crotheim@aoc.gov. All requests must include: Company Name, Address, Phone Number, Name of Contact Person, and Solicitation Number. *TELEPHONE REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.*

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 17 c/o VA North Texas Health Care System, Dallas, TX intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Baird, Hampton and Brown Inc. to provide complete architectural and engineering services for design, construction documents, construction cost estimates and construction period services for the renovation of the Campus Steam Condensate Return System at the Dallas VA facility.  Renovation of the system is necessary to reduce major loss of steam condensate and other related resources associated with replacing the lost condensate-including resultant excess utility costs for water, sewer and electricity, and water treatment chemicals.  Baird, Hampton and Brown Inc. completed an initial study and found deficiencies were the result of piping system deterioration and leakage, inadequate capacity of system to return existing volume of condensate, and uncapped abandoned lines.  Baird, Hampton and Brown Inc. was selected for the study insofar as they are Engineer of Record for replacement Energy Center and campus utilities for Spinal Cord Injury Center and Clinical Addition projects and have unique knowledge and expertise of this facility's utility systems.  This contract will design corrections as recommended by the study.  Estimated value of construction to be designed is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  Numbered Note 22 applies.  This is not a request for proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Smithsonian Institution seeks interested small to mid-sized contractors (fewer than twenty licensed professionals in the prime contractor’s firm) to establish open term Architect-Engineer (A/E) Contracts that would provide design support for Smithsonian Tropical Research Institution facilities in Panama. It is anticipated that multiple awards will be made.  After award of an open term contract, A/E services will be provided on a work order contract basis.  It is anticipated that the contract will be for a period of one year with nine one-year options and that the contract may provide a maximum design effort of $500,000 PER YEAR, with individual WORK ORDERS NOT TO EXCEED $100,000 in total for Title I and/or non-Title I services.  The Smithsonian Institution does not guarantee a minimum design effort.  Services to be provided includes experience and knowledge, but are not limited to the following: architectural and engineering studies (Structural, Mechanical & Electrical), safety issues related to all aspects of the project, testing and analyses; facility and project planning; conceptual design; facilities assessment; evaluation of projects; cost estimating for project proposals and multi-discipline detailed construction cost estimating; value engineering; U.S.A. Federal Code Compliance and accessibility review; commissioning; development of contract documents comprised of drawings and specifications for architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, fire protection, security systems and hazardous materials abatement for a variety of small projects.   Typically the work includes minor repairs, building renovation, facility improvement projects, interior space planning, mitigating accessibility barriers and a limited amount of new facility development. While the work may involve implementing portions of facility master plan projects developed by others, the greater number of work orders will be for smaller projects.   Post design services may include construction bid and negotiation support, construction administration, submittal reviews and/or construction coordination, and preparation of as-built record drawings.  A/E’s will be expected to respond to Smithsonian requests for services with expediency, thoroughness and a high level of design quality.  Bilingual capability is a must for all participants. Firm evaluation and selection will be conducted in accordance with FAR 36.6 (http://www.arnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart_36_6.html) and will be based on the following criteria:
1.)	Prime and subcontractors’ qualifications and experience.  Basic disciplines shall include architectural, space planning, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, structural, civil, safety, fire protection, security, cost estimating, and hazardous materials abatement.

FAX 573-638-9511 EXISTING CONDITIONS 	The Missouri National Guard does not have a comprehensive inventory of the timber stands on Camp Crowder Training Site (CCTS).  This Scope of Work (SOW) is to set froth guidelines for a contractor to furnish the Missouri National Guard with a Pre-manageme nt Inventory (Timber Cruise).  The contractor will conduct this Pre-management Inventory on the timber stands on both South Post and North Post of CCTS.  The regulatory guidance for this project is Army Regulation 200-3 of 1995 and the Sikes Act Improvemen t Act of 1997.  PROPOSED PROJECT 	The contractor will provide all necessary equipment, labor, and materials to perform this project.  The project is located on the Missouri National Guards Camp Crowder Training Site, located 4 miles southeast of Neosho, Missouri.  The total acreage for t his project is 3374 acres.  Subtracted from this total are firing ranges on South Post and cantonment areas and open fields on North Post.    ACCESS  	The contractor may use all roads, combat trails, and logging paths to access the timber stands on both South and North Post.  However, the contractor will restrict the use of logging paths and primitive combat trails to the use of All Terrain Vehicles (AT V).  The contractor will take care not to cause any damage to either the trees or the ground surface.  The contractor will repair and reseed any ruts or other ground disturbance caused by his use.  Refer to the seeding chart enclosed in this SOW. Normal access to the training site is from 0700 to 1700 Monday thru Friday.  If the contractor wishes to extend those hours, he should make arrangements with post headquarters and post security for an access key.   Missouri National Guard training and oper ations take precedent over contractor activities. The contractor should consult weekly schedules with the CCTS headquarters.  This is to alleviate any confusion as to the movement of troops and training operations.  The contractor will submit weekly progre ss reports to the Project Manager via phone or email.  This is to monitor the project for efficiency and time of completion.  The MOARNG has provided maps with marked locations at the end of this document.  The Project Manager will furnish any additional maps and assist the contractor in determining the exact locations of the project areas.  The MOARNG will discuss compartment ma nagement objectives, listing of forest stands, and acreages for each.   The MOARNG will provide one tour of the compartments.  This is to familiarize the contractor with the area and answer questions about the inventory process.  The MOARNG will hold a kick-off meeting with the successful contractor prior to start of work.  Th e MOARNG will conduct a minimum of two check scale periods to determine the reliability of the contractors inventory.  If necessary, the MOARNG will consult with the contractor to make corrections.            INVENTORY REQUIREMENTS a.	The contractor will divide the forest compartments (inventory areas) into separate stands.  The contractor will draw the stands on a provided topographic map.  The MOARNG will provide separate topographic map of each compartment.  The MOARNG will digiti ze these stands using an in-house GIS system.     b.	For stand boundaries, the contractor should use drainages, ridges, aspect, roads, trails, and property lines.   c.	For each stand the contractor wi ll use the following chart:   Stand Size 		Minimum Number of Plots 10 acres		3 10  20 acres		5 	20 + acres		5 + 1 plot for every additional 10 acres             Consider additional plots if the stand conditions are highly variable.  The 	contractor will mark each plot on a map with the plot number.  The contractor will 	then provide a 	compass heading and distance to the next plot center.        d.   The contractor will plot data and forest stand information using a CMT-V 	electronic data recorder.  This is to be consistent with the Missouri Department of 	Conservation (MDC) DATACOL inventory program. The MOARNG will 	provide this data record er to the successful bidder.   For each plot the contractor 	will use a ten (10) factor basal area prism, or equivalent equipment, to identify the 	countable trees on the variable radius plot.  Record only the in trees in the 	inventory plot data.        e.    For each tree, record, as a minimum, the tree species code, diameter measured at 	breast height, (DBH), in two inch increments, the number of eight foot logs to a 	merchantable 	height, dominant, co-dominant, or suppressed, and tree condition.      f.    Mark plots with a strip of survey flagging tape hanging from a limb located at 	approximately eye level near center of the plot.         g.

8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:
A)	Program Description

The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asia has responsibility for the development and management of the U.S. Government’s assistance program for the five Central Asian Republics. This program is directed at supporting a program of policy reform, economic recovery, democratic and social transition in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

Within the USAID Regional Mission for Central Asia the Office of Health and Education (HE) has the primary responsibility for management of assistance in the social sectors, primarily health reform, prevention and control of infectious diseases, and maternal, child, and reproductive health.  USAID/HE serves as the primary point of communication on these sectors with the governments of the five Central Asian Republics (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan); five U.S. Embassies in Central Asia; non-governmental organizations (indigenous, U. S., international); other donors and private commercial entities. USAID is funding activities in public health care reform (which includes health financing, policy, and systems reform); infectious disease prevention and control (tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and avian influenza); and maternal, child, and reproductive health.  

USAID/CAR’s strategic objective in health is: Increased utilization of quality primary health care in selected populations.  This objective is achieved through four intermediate results: (1) select populations are better informed about personal health care rights and responsibilities; 
(2) improved quality of health care including infectious diseases and maternal and child health; (3) improved use of health care resources for primary health care and (4) improved legislative, regulatory and policy framework. 

A major challenge in the region is to a) restructure the public health sector to focus on primary health care; b) reduce the burden of disease caused by infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, acute respiratory infection, diarrheal diseases, hepatitis, etc; and c) improve the quality of primary health care services to address the high mortality and morbidity caused by diseases such as cardiovascular, cancer and other lifestyle related diseases which are observed in more developed countries.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT    The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is in the process of conducting market research for Ground Applications Program Office (GAPO) at Fort Belvoir Virginia.  The government is seeking vendor sources to fulfill requirements for future products and services relating to a commercially available Acquisition Procurement and Program Management Database Applications utilizing Window 2003 Server platform using Window XP operating system and MS Office Suite 2003 or higher.  The focus of this Sources Sought requirement is to identify commercial software solutions consisting of a single or multiple array of products to serve as a database repository for acquisition and program planning data.  The data requirements must be tailor able to reflect the program office needs and integrate multiple functional disciplines such as Finance, Contracts, Logistics, Program Management, Purchasing and other activities involved in the acquisition process.  This database must enable report generation to provide current accurate information to decision makers. It is desired to be a web-based application enabling remote access capability.  Minimal activity requirements include electronic routing of procurement packages for review and approval, electronic signature capabilities, the ability to receive, analyze, execute and track purchase/procurement actions in support of a program environment, and the ability for multilevel tracking for both the program management and procurement management system lifecycles. Optimally it is desired to have no redundancy in the program documentation process allowing multiple users to enter data one time and use it to support all management and oversight requirements. This application must provide for administrator security protocals to enable security database protections. The program documentation includes, but is not limited to Single Acquisition Management Plans (SAMP), Acquisition Program Baselines (APB), System Production Certifications (SPC), Statements of Work (SOW), Statements of Objectives (SOO) Product Descriptions, Performance Specifications, and contracting documentation to support the acquisition of developmental and production systems as needed. The application/database will be installed either on a HP 380 DL G4 server or on the FAS-270 SAN.  The application database must have back up capability using the Spectra Logic tape library. The new system should provide access to remote workstations and increased data traffic through WAN should be kept to a minimum. The software should be tailor able to the present and future needs of the program office and have potential to become a resource which can be used by all the DoD Services.  This is not a request for proposal and no proposal will be entertained at this time.  Responses are due NLT 1700 EST on 8 SEPT 2006.   Vendor and product information may be mailed directly or sent in electronic format to the point of contact for this action.  Information desired are white papers (limited to five pages, 12 pitch font, Times New Roman)  product literature, and MS. PowerPoint presentations showing application screenshots.   The POC for this action is: Ms.  Denise Lanier, 703-704-3508, denise.g.lanier@us.army.mil,  5895 Wilson Road, Building 337, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060.  The subject line of email should read GAPO Market Research Response followed by your company name.

<SOLNBR>W52P1J06R0196
<RESPDATE>090706
<ARCHDATE>11062006
<CONTACT>Julie Coughlin, 309-782-6139
<DESC>The Industrial Base Readiness Division of the Joint Munitions Command (JMC) is conducting a market survey of industry to identify sources that are interested in manufacturing the Mk58 Marine Location Marker. The technical POC is: Paul Ader (paul.ader @navy.mil), US Navy Research and Development Engineering Center, (812) 854-2212.  The technical description of this item is as follows: The Mk 58 Mod 1 Marine Location Marker consists of a cylindrical tin can approximately 21.78 inches long and 5.00 inches in diameter. The can contains two pyrotechnic candles containing 1000 grams and 8 70 grams of a red phosphorus composition. The can is strengthened and the candles are supported by foamed-in-place polyurethane. The ignition end of the marker has three holes, two for smoke and flame emission, and one for entry of water to the Mk 72 Mod 1  Water Activated Battery. Adhesive foil discs hermetically seal the two emission holes and a reinforced adhesive foil strip with a rectangular pull ring hermetically seals the battery cavity hole. The adhesive foil seals are protected during handling and s hipping by a replaceable polyethylene protective cover. The marker contains a battery, squib, starter mix, two pyrotechnic candles, and a transfer fuse between the two candles. It is armed by removal of adhesive backed metallic foil strip (tear tape). The marker is activated upon entry into seawater with water entering the water port to activate the battery. Battery current energizes the electric squib, which ignites the starter mix, which in turn, lights the pyrotechnic candle. The first candle burns for a  minimum of 20 minutes and then initiates the second candle by the use of the transfer fuse. The complete marker produces a continuous yellow flame and white smoke for a burn time of approximately 40 to 60 minutes.

<SUBJECT>Internet Relay Chat (IRC) System
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC-SD) requires engineering support to provide application development, prototype development, integration, support experimentation, maintenance, database administration, configuration management, and help-desk support for the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) system.  SSC-SD intends to award a sole-source, Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract to Asynchrony HUBzone, LLC for these services. This contractor has been selected for the following reasons: (1) their extensive background and highly specialized knowledge in developing and implementing a chat service, Envoke, within the legacy DoD Collaboration Tool Suite (the official Joint collaboration system, located at all COCOM sites), (2) their extensive and highly specialized background in developing and implementing application and web-service based collaborative services in the Joint Explosive Ordnance Disposal arena, and (3) their knowledge of text chat and instant messaging architectures, such as those most prevalent in the three services, with special insight into Internet Relay Chat. Asynchrony Hubzone, LLC has acquired a unique and valuable history in the provision of chat/messaging capabilities to the Department of Defense. Their work in support of the DoD Information Services Agencyâ€™s Collaboration Management Office, providing key chat/messaging components for the DoD Collaboration Tool Suite (DCTS) has provided them unique insight and experience into the requirements of tactical level chat/messaging, not currently met by any other HubZone or non-Hubzone small business. The Government requires extensive expertise in the provision of text chat/messaging in high latency, high bandwidth, high packet loss environments, as well as the ability to understand legacy compatibility to the DCTS. Asynchrony Hubzone, LLC possesses recent experience with the Envoke chat system in DCTS. Asynchrony Hubzone, LLC has: â€¢ Created a secure instant messaging system capable of integrating into legacy systems (DCTS) â€¢ Created encrypted file transfer capabilities within the DCTS â€¢ Created federated collaboration server architectures â€¢ Adhered to and was able to create JITC (Joint Interoperability Test Center) certified software â€¢ Created bridge software to various collaboration tools on a tactical network â€¢ Created highly security framework for tactical environments. â€¢ Participated in the Collaboration Interoperability Working Group on a regular basis The Government has determined that the nature of the security and system vulnerabilities inherent in todayâ€™s chat system within DoD and the Navy warrant an urgent need to resolve these issues as soon as possible. The need to produce near-term solutions requires that action be taken immediately. Asynchrony Hubzone, LLC, is the only source that can perform the contractual effort without substantial duplication of cost to the Government, and without unacceptable delays in the delivery of the desired capabilities. The contract Period of Performance is 3 years (1-year base; 2-year option). The estimated value of the contract is NTE $3 Million, including the option. Note 22 applies.

Some of the unique features and functions of the chip-based nanospray sample introduction system are:

1.	LC/MS coupling with fraction collection into 96-well or 384-well plates, with partial flow diverted to a high density electrospray/nanspray chip with 400 spray nozzles for spraying at 150-200 nl/min flow rates.  A post-column splitter and a 6-port valve for diverting flow are required.
2.	A coupler to allow direct interface between 400 nozzle chip and nanoflow LC-MS system.
3.	Direct sample-well to nozzle chip interface to allow direct infusion of samples.  1-10 microliter sample aspiration with minimum of 1 microliter (out of 3) sample volume.  Nanospray flow rates of 20nl/min-200 nl/min, depending on chip.  Ability to infuse samples from up to 384 wells, each into an individual tip.
4.	Chips must have 400 individual nozzles, be resistant ammonium acetate concentrations of up to 10mM, must be made from chemically insulated silicon wafer, must have a nozzle ID of no more than 10 microns and an OD of no more than 40 microns
5.	Peltier-based sample cooling system to cool samples to 4 °C.
6.	Integrated spray-sensor to evaluate stability of nanospray conditions.
7.	Computer-based data system to control interface. Software should have function to return unused sample to well, control the the TriVersa, provide user with control of LC samples, fraction collection and how long to spray infusion samples and synchronize with Mass Spectrometer via means of contact closures
8.	Custom bracket to interface instrument to Waters QTOF Premier mass spectrometer.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order on a sole source basis to Dr. Madelyn Gould from Columbia University to conduct the project title: “Sudden death and use of stimulant medications in youth”, based on the authority granted by FAR Part 6.302-1.

As the principal investigator on the original study, Dr Gould is uniquely qualified to continue the analysis of the additional ADHD drugs and sudden death.  Dr. Gould’s comprehensive understanding and working knowledge of the initial study are critical to the overall assessment of this study.   This not only allows an efficient use of data that have already been collected, but also allows for a timely analysis of a very important public health issue.

Scope of Work:

The Contractor shall provide Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (OSE) a completed case-control analysis in a final report.  This analysis will require the review of state mortality data collected from 47 states for the years 1985 to 1996.  Investigators will review state mortality data to identify cases and controls; death certificates are requested for cases (a sudden unexplained death that has been listed as ICD code: E-798, sudden death, cause unknown; E799.9, other ill-defined and unknown causes of deaths; and E427, cardiac arrhythmia). Deaths will be excluded if there are known physical causes for the deaths or co-existing physical disorders known to be associated with sudden death.  Controls will include groups of children who died in motor vehicle accidents (ICD code E812.1) where the victim was a passenger. Controls will be matched on year of death, age and gender. 

After reviewing the death certificates the investigators will conduct a follow-back survey by contacting the parents of the victim in a letter.  The letter will include a description of the study and a one-page survey.  The survey collects information on past medical history and medications taken at the time of death.  Pharmacy and medical records are obtained to confirm survey information.

The Contractor shall provide evidence of the quality of the data.

An award will be made in fifteen (15) days from the date of this notice. Sources may submit a quote, which fully demonstrate their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responses or questions regarding this posting must be in writing and can be sent via email to Alice.Pagan@fda.hhs.gov.  No phone calls will be accepted. This sole source procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition for commercial items in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5.

		2) The date of the new photoconductor drum installation.
                                a) The subsequent dates that the cartridge has been refurbished for use following the initial installation of the new drum. 

	2.2 Remanufacture: The remanufacturing of laser printer cartridges will include the following steps as applicable to the toner cartridge:

1)	Disassemble the cartridge completely for thorough cleaning of all parts and replacement of any defective/unsatisfactory parts.  If used for cleaning purposes, alcohol must be pure with no water content.
	
2)	Lubricate the necessary parts as required.

3)	Refill the toner chamber with a premium grade (virgin/unused) toner of the appropriate consistency for the cartridge type per OEM specifications, and seal to prevent leakage during shipment.

4)	A reliable OEM adhesive type (cold seal) method of sealing the cartridge toner chamber shall be used.  Toner leakage during shipment or use will not be acceptable.

5)	Clean photoconductor drum, apply a polymer coating or replace as required. The contractor shall be responsible for testing the electronic resistance of the conductor surface of each drum to determine that optimum performance will be achieved during each usage cycle.  All cartridges being submitted for remanufacturing for the first time shall have a New Longlife Aftermarket Drum installed (see requirement 2.1).

6)	Set toner bar (doctor blade) spacing as required.  A new cleaning blade must be installed with each new drum installation.

A copy of the plan shall be provided to the Contracting Officer with the submission of the proposal.  An updated written document of the Replacement Plan shall be provided to the Contracting Officer for approval as changes occur.


4.	PREPARATION FOR DELIVERY

	4.1 Packaging: Each laser printer toner cartridge supplied under this specification must be delivered to the user in a water, light, and air-tight, protective package.  Material such as polyfoil with further foam insulation and corrugated carton packaging will be adequate for reshipping and storage of the product to assure safe delivery and satisfactory performance when installed for use.  All remanufactured laser printer toner cartridges shall be packaged to ensure safe delivery to destination.  Reuse of the original packing is encouraged whenever practical.  Cartons must be packed sufficiently to eliminate empty space that would allow movement of contents during shipment. OEM style packing for each cartridge shall be required.  End caps and/or bubble wrap shall be used for impact insulation for cartridges to be shipped individually by common carrier.

	4.2 Marking: Unless otherwise specified, shipping containers shall be marked with name of material, class and quantity contained herein, name of the contractor and contract and purchase order numbers.  Also, the package shall include a statement to “Retain for return of used cartridge”.

<DESC>The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB intends to award a contract on a Brand Name basis for the purchase of items listed in the Description of Supplies.     This is a streamlined combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being accepted and a written solicitation will not be issued.     This requirement is issued as a request for quotation.     The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04.

The NAICS Code is 4236100; size standard 100.

IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304c (1) , as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1(c) – Application for Brand Name Descriptions.  A Firm Fixed Priced Award will be in accordance with the following Description of Supplies: 

DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES 

A.     Following items shall be provided:

CLIN: 0001
Description:     High End Studio Spot 575 CYM Studio Spot with Lamp
Quantity:     Four (4)

CLIN: 0002
Description:     High End Studio Color 575 MSR Studio Light with Lamp
Quantity:     Four (4)
                         

JUSTIFICATION:     

In April 2003, HQ AFSVA purchased a High End Systems lighting control console at a cost of $100,000.00 to control the lighting system presently being used by AFSVA in support of Tops and Blues.  To date, over $280,000.00 has been invested in the current system.  A requirement exists to purchase additional components for replacement and upgrade of the original systems equipment configuration.  The upgrade would allow AFSVA the capability to automatically switch power supply on all international voltages at 50 or 60 Hertz, replace standard color wheels with two double wheels that can rotate to achieve continuous color mixing, include a lamp power reduction for special applications, and  the patented elliptical/spherical reflector system delivers an extraordinary gain in light output compared to systems in similar fixtures.  Additionally, Studio Spot can also serve as a DMX tester to view channel values and errors.  Substantial man-hours have been spent on training of personnel as well as costs incurred in the acquisition of the current lighting system.  In order for the primary control console to function as designed by the manufacturer no other manufacturer’s components will meet the Government’s requirement.  Failure to maintain system compatibility and interoperability with the High End system environment would introduce unknown product mixture malfunctions, complicate system configuration control, and void existing warranties.  This will be a firm fixed price purchase order.


CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Award will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.     Evaluation procedures in FAR Part 13.106-2 will be utilized.  

The following factors listed below shall be used to evaluate the responses.

(Technical Proposal)

The technical proposal shall demonstrate the ability to provide the required supplies and/or services IAW the referenced specifications and salient characteristics that provides the best value to the government.

(2)  Price (Price Proposal)

The firm fixed price shall be based on open market rates to include any applicable discounts.  Since award will be based on initial responses, you are encouraged to offer your most advantageous pricing in the initial response.  Freight will be addressed as a separate line item if required.  The ordering office will make a determination that the total 
firm fixed price is fair and reasonable based on the factors contained herein.   

Interested parties capable of providing the above must submit a written price quote to include discount terms, Cage Code, DUNS number, and Tax ID.

This means that DFAS Rome requires its own PBX for telephony support. 
 
2.0 SCOPE:  The Nortel PBX at DFAS Rome requires an upgrade in order to meet Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) requirements.  DFAS Rome currently has a population of 564 personnel.  Rome’s population will increase by 436 more personnel due to BRAC realignment.  The Nortel 61C PBX is currently not a fully functional PBX. The contractor will provide equipment, software, and such technical support and training needed to install and implement the upgrade of the Nortel PBX to version 4.5 with Call Pilot, Symposium Express, and IP trunking capability.  The contractor will upgrade the frame relay room to required specifications needed to support the total population of DFAS Rome.  DFAS will provide some parts to offset costs.  These parts will be provided from the San Bernardino DFAS site.  The list of San Bernardino equipment is attached.  All equipment and installation shall meet applicable local codes for electrical and personnel safety ratings. All equipment must meet JTIC certifications. The contractor shall provide the necessary interfaces (cabling and wiring) for the PBX.  

3.0 OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this statement of work (SOW) is for the contractor to engineer, furnish, install, program and test the upgrade of the Nortel 61C PBX to version 4.5 or greater with Call Pilot, Symposium Express, DSN, and IP trunk ready.
