 Visiting vendors may obtain daily passes directly from the individual Navy installations by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through a designated independent contractor NCACS service provider. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed/renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract.
 Further information regarding NCACS is forthcoming.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest (NAVFAC SW) is extending the current Northern California and Nevada 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA). NAVFAC SW is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) "Developmental Stage" (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (Fresno, Sacramento, San Francisco, CA; and Las Vegas, NV) to participate in this BOA program. CURRENT BOA HOLDERS DO NOT NEED TO REAPPLY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs. The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c). The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts. The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between NAVFAC SW and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement. Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract. In accordance with DFARS Clause 252.219-7009 the 8(a) firm shall not subcontract the performance of any of the requirements of the contract without the prior written approval of the SBA and the Contracting Officer. Additionally FAR Clause 52.219-14 defines the limitations on subcontracting should approval to subcontract be obtained. Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed. If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government, upon SBA concurrence, reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts. The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items). Only NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and 238 pertain to this BOA. Each firm will identify their primary NAICS code and a secondary NAICS code (if applicable). There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement; however, there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,500,000 per firm. Individual task orders will range between $2,001 and $1,000,000. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety Letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $30,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each order. Task orders will not be advertised. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA. Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA. Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible. To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) Developmental Stage participant prior to the submission deadline indicated below and still be certified as an 8(a) Developmental Stage participant at the time of award (planned award date is June 30, 2014); have a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (Fresno, Sacramento, San Francisco, CA; and Las Vegas, NV); (2) Be registered in the System for Award Management database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/; the SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; and VETS-100 at http://www.dol.gov/vets/vets-100.html (if not applicable, provide a statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $2,001 - $1,000,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) under NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and/or 238 within the last three years. The BOA shall be between NAVFAC SW and the 8(a) firm only. The BOA will not be between NAVFAC SW and a Joint Venture/Mentor Prot&eacute;g&eacute; firm. TO BE CONSIDERED, INTERESTED FIRMS MUST DOWNLOAD AND USE THE CHECKLIST FROM THIS WEBSITE TO ENSURE ALL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED. After carefully reviewing the submittal requirements checklist to ensure compliance, please submit your package to NAVFAC SW, Attn: Elliott Penetrante, Code RAQ20, 1220 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92132, or via email to elliott.penetrante@navy.mil not later than 2:00 PM Pacific time on April 15, 2014.

<DESC>Notice Type:		Presolicitation Notice<br>Title:			Special Operations Forces Requirements Analysis, Prototyping, Training, Operations and Rehearsal III (SOF RAPTOR III)<br><br>Purpose: The purpose of this notice is to alert industry that PEO STRI will soon be issuing a competitive solicitation for the SOF RAPTOR III effort.  Estimated RFP release is late July 2012. <br><br>Brief Summary:  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Product Manager for Special Operations Forces (SOF) Training Systems (PM STS) will issue an RFP to replace the existing Special Operations Forces Requirements Analysis, Prototyping, Training, Operations and Rehearsal II (SOF RAPTOR II) contract.  SOF RAPTOR II supports numerous efforts in support of the objectives of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and its component commands:  United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWARCOM), Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC), and Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC).  <br><br>Program Description:  PM STS requires a contract vehicle to replace the existing SOF RAPTOR II contract which is close to reaching its ceiling.  The SOF RAPTOR II contract, awarded in April 2009 with a ceiling of $48.9M, is a single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle, which replaced the SOF RAPTOR I contract.   The SOF RAPTOR I contract was comprised of efforts that were 100% Engineering Services, whereas the SOF RAPTOR II contract was a mix of Engineering Services and Program Management efforts.  Both contracts were awarded to small businesses.  <br><br>SOF RAPTOR II provides the means for conducting live, virtual and constructive training, services, training requirements analysis, concept exploration, prototyping, advanced concept exploration, rapid prototype development, and operation and maintenance functions to support USSOCOM and its component command training, simulator and simulation requirements.  <br><br>It is expected that SOF RAPTOR III will continue to evolve in the future and is geared towards overall engineering services management rather than engineering services alone.<br><br>Acquisition Strategy: The SOF RAPTOR III competition will be conducted as a Total Small Business Set Aside, utilizing Best Value Trade Off Source Selection procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.101-1. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this effort has been identified as 541330, "Engineering Services", with a size standard of $35M.  <br><br>The SOF RAPTOR III competition will result in a single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with a ceiling of $97.8M.<br>

<DESC>Digital Helmet Mounted Display<br />Request for Information (RFI): #WNUK-14-009
<p>Request for Information: <br />This request for information (RFI) constitutes neither a Request for Proposal or an Invitation for Bid. It does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This RFI should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; this is an RFI only in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a guarantee to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.</p>
<p>The Government is also interested in applicable vendor demonstration of technologies and systems (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 as defined at: http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/publications/docs/TRA2011.pdf , pages 2-13 and 2-14). Interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information, materials, and/or demonstrations received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by any information received.</p>
<p>1. Background and Scope: <br />The United States (US) Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Human Systems Division (HSD), Aircrew Performance Branch exists to protect forces by providing warfighters integrated offensive and defensive capabilities to deter, anticipate, detect, neutralize, assess, and mitigate threats against hazards to air operations.</p>
<p>As weapon systems have become increasingly complex and aircrews are exposed to extensive amounts of battlespace information, it has become clear that a significant effort is necessary to provide a revolutionary leap in Digital Helmet Mounted Display (DHMD) capability for the warfighter. Industry and academia have recently made major advances in Helmet Mounted Displays, visual technologies, future force technologies, capabilities, and surrogate material solutions applicable to DHMD capabilities for aircrew personnel.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to determine existing and emerging Developmental, Commercial-off-the Shelf (COTS), or Government-off -the-shelf (GOTS) technology solutions across several areas of interest that can be used to enhance aircrew warfighting operational capabilities with respect to DHMD capabilities. The technologies may address one or more capability areas described below, or potentially address all of the areas as an integrated DHMD system. Each technology addressed must also include a roadmap identifying the timeline for technology development.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this RFI, the government is interested in any information associated with DHMD technology (full systems, sub-systems, components, sensors, etc.). Any DHMD related capability that falls within a TRL designation of three through nine, as described in the Technical Areas below is of interest under this RFI.</p>
<p>The DHMD system will potentially consist of imaging optics, sensor, processing, and displays all mounted directly on to, or integrated into, an aircrew helmet. Note that this is an extension beyond current HMD systems in aircraft that are restricted to displaying symbology. Systems of interest to this RFI are more consistent with digital implementations of night vision goggles, which will seamlessly integrate imagery captured over multiple spectral bands and symbology information. Of particular interest under this RFI is the marriage of the capabilities of these two systems into one that surpasses the performance of either in terms of functionality while reducing Size, Weight, Ergonomics, Power and Integration (SWEPI). As a point of reference, key technical specifications for fielded night vision goggle systems as well as the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) are provided in Table 1.</p>
<p>Table 1: Key Metrics of Currently Fielded Systems<br />Metric ANVIS-9 JHMCS<br />Functional Range Night (&gt; &frac14; moon) Day<br />Field of view (degrees) 40 circular 20 circular<br />Resolution (lp/mm) &ge; 64 ~ 30<br />Frame rate (Hz) ~ 1000 60<br />Display Color Monochromatic Monochromatic<br />Contrast Ratio N/A 1.2:1 (against 10,000' Lambert)<br />Mass (kg) of head/helmet supported components 0.8 ~ 0.4</p>
<p>The technology must not pose any safety or health hazards (i.e. toxic components, toxic waste, gases, fumes, burning residue, noise, etc.) against which aircrew personnel cannot be protected.</p>
<p>2. Capability Requirements: <br />The Government is interested in receiving information on a broad array of technologies that have the potential to enhance aircrew warfighter operational capabilities in fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft platforms. Respondents must be cognizant of the importance of SWEPI relative to head-borne capabilities, specifically a DHMD orientation. Minimized SWEPI is highly desirable. The Government is interested in receiving white papers focused on the following Technology Areas (TA):</p>
<p>TA: Symbology - Symbology depicted in a DHMD capability can greatly enhance aircrew capability. Color symbology is expected to be a DHMD attribute. Placement of symbology is a potential area of enhancement such as location placement in the field of regard relative to the sides, top, bottom, and projected into an environment. Technologies that ease the cognitive burden on the pilot and reduce distractions are highly desirable. This technology could include dynamic adjustment of symbology attributes based on physiological inputs, eye position, situation, etc. as well as conformal symbology, which is the ability to project the information into the environment (i.e., 3D displays).</p>
<p>TA: Sensors - Hardware - For helmet mounted imagers, the minimization of SWEPI is paramount. This area encompasses both the focal planes and the paired optics. The most beneficial spectral ranges to be included for in-cockpit (helmet mounted) use are visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared (SWIR). Visible sensors are included to allow for the possible use of an opaque display. The primary goal of the sensors is to allow for as close to human visual system performance in terms of field of view, acuity, and luminance, etc. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to, multi-spectral and/or extended/ enhanced spectral ranges; dynamic binning; and extreme low power focal planes. The imagers will be used to enhance visual ability by providing imagery under low-light level (i.e. night vision) as well as working in coordination with algorithms to enhance objects (e.g., vehicles, people, etc.) of interest. Therefore, performance metrics include not only traditional metrics such as Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR), but also metrics such as detectivity and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.</p>
<p>It is also anticipated that benefits will be gained from sensor information that is not directly part of the helmet mounted unit. This can include, but is not limited to, mid-wave infrared (MWIR), long-wave infrared (LWIR), as well as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and other non-imaging information. This additional information could come from sensors located directly on the aircraft or from other assets. The challenges for these sensors are similar to those mounted directly on the helmet. Additionally, head-tracking sensors inside the cockpit - mounted on the helmet and/or cockpit interior could prove extremely beneficial to target acquisition and enhanced situational awareness. These sensors also face challenges communicating the information as well as potentially having to adjust the perspective of the imagery to match that of the person wearing the HMD. Addressing these issues might be a combination of hardware and software.</p>
<p>TA: Sensors - Algorithms - Algorithms play a critical role in several aspects of a DHMD, which for the purposes of this RFI have been classified into two different categories: 1) image fusion across multiple spectral bands; 2) object detection, recognition, and identification (DRI). Specific tasks of interest under each category include:</p>
<p>Table 2: Algorithms of Interest<br />Category Potential/Representative Capabilities<br />Image fusion across multiple spectral bands High frame rate fusion with perspective correction; optimal representations in order to enhance visibility of a) vehicles, b) humans, c) terrain through fog, haze and / or dust; Seeing beyond normal field of regard (through floor, behind vehicle, while under head restraint); ability to see imagery from sensors not helmet mounted including but not limited to changing imagery perspective to match that of user; extracting or creating color information from outside of visible band sensors with particular interest on near and short-wave infrared.<br />object detection, recognition, and identification (DRI) DRI on objects of interest including people and vehicles, which could also include blue and red force designations; cueing tasks which includes, but is not limited to: line of sight, targeting, terrain following / avoidance</p>
<p>TA: Data Transfer Protocol - With the ever growing amount of sensor data expected to be displayed at increasingly higher resolutions, aircrews may require faster data transfer protocols that allow for faster display data update and display refresh rates than currently deployed. Solutions must be compatible with current aircraft interfaces (MIL-STD-1553B / Ethernet / USB / WIFI).</p>
<p>TA: Displays - The ultimate metric by which displays are judged are by how they are perceived by the user. It will be important to clearly describe how the proposed technology impacts final user specification, which includes field of view, resolution, luminance (display and real-world if see through), latency, dynamic range, color scale, etc. All technologies that can meet the overall requirements are of interest, and include, but are not limited to: high resolution (&gt; 5 megapixel) microdisplays, high-frame rate microdisplays, micro (scale size &#61603; cm2) and macro (scale size ~ 10's cm2) curved/flexible displays and related fabrication methodologies, micro (scale size &#61603; cm2) and macro (scale size ~ 10's cm2) transparent displays and related fabrication methodologies, ultra-low power displays, full color displays, dynamic resolution (i.e., foveating) displays, 3D displays.</p>
<p>Note - If the display is to be projected to the eye (i.e. not directly mounted in front of the eyes) then the optical system (e.g., relay optics, free form lenses, waveguides, etc.) responsible for this should be described and the size and weight must be included in the overall system properties.</p>
<p>TA: Situational Awareness - Aircrew require the ability to operate in the vicinity of both friendly force units as well enemy forces and must be able to distinguish between the two. Examples of situational awareness may include, but are not limited to, passive and active tagging systems, directional indicators, head referenced video from pod-mounted sources and blue-force/red-force tracking sensor information. Acquiring information and increasing the battlespace and situational awareness through visual enhancement is highly desirable.</p>
<p>TA: Human Interface - Optimization of information interface with the user is critical. A large viewing eyebox area ensures unvignetted viewing of the image source. Outside of that area, the image will vignette or be clipped, but will still be visible. Viewing eyebox area should, if applicable, be considered. Exit pupil and eye relief of a pupil-forming optical design should, if applicable, be considered. Image warping to optimize information interface with the user and correction for hyper-stereopsis should be addressed. Image adjustability for inter-pupillary distance across a diverse population of users is desirable.</p>
<p>TA: Eye Tracking - In-helmet eye tracking can enhance target acquisition by image registration relative to the eye. Eye tracking can expand target acquisition by allowing information to be presented where the eyes are looking versus where the head is positioned. Expanding target acquisition by tracking the eyes is desirable. Eye tracking can contribute to cognitive and physiological state awareness. Vigilance and sleepiness determined by oculometrics such as Eye Blink Velocity (EBV), Eye Blink Duration (EBD), Percentage of Time Eyes are Closed (PERCLOS), Eye Movement Velocity (EBV), etc. and application of Composite Oculometric Fatigue Index (COFI) are desirable to help identify cognitive and physiological state awareness. SWEPI optimization is applicable to this TA.</p>
<p>TA: Head Tracking - Magnetic head tracking, optical head tracking (head-borne light emitting diodes), and reflective head tracking (reflective stickers or paint schemes) are examples of head tracking technologies that are desirable.</p>
<p>TA: Aircrew Monitoring - It is highly desirable to be able to measure, interpret, and incorporate aircrew physiological and cognitive information in to the DHMD data flow. Cognitive and Physiological monitoring can facilitate optimization by sensing or detecting cognitive and physiological state, assessing the state relative to performance, and augmenting performance to optimize mission effectiveness such as Auto-de-cluttering of symbology/Adaptive Automation (toggle on/off). Non-invasive monitoring and incorporating physiological and cognitive information will ensure optimum information is presented to the aircrew. It will also enable an objective method to identify degradation in physiological and cognitive performance. This can inform or make recommendations to the aircrew to mitigate potential mishaps related to fatigue, cognitive overload, G-Induced loss of consciousness (GLOC), spatial disorientation, etc. Measuring the physiological and cognitive performance indicators may include, but are not limited to: eye tracking electrooculography (EOG), electrocardiogram (EKG), electroencephalography (EEG), galvanic skin response (GSR), cerebral oximetry, mask oxygen and carbon dioxide content, volatile organic compound identification and characterization, blood flow, hydration, and other technologies that are non-invasive and capable of being assimilated in an aircrew helmet while taking SWEPI into consideration.</p>
<p>3. Instructions to Potential Respondents: <br />This is NOT a Request for Proposal. Interested vendors who desire to participate in this market survey and demonstration event are encouraged to submit white papers that demonstrate they presently have the technology and qualifications to satisfy the capability requirement of one or more of the TA's described above. White papers should be prepared in Microsoft Word format using 1-inch margins and font size not less than 11pt. An example white paper format is attached.</p>
<p>White papers for each technology should be no more than 5 pages in length and should address at a minimum the following topics:<br />&bull; Reference which TA(s) is/are being addressed<br />&bull; Discuss how the technology addresses the capability requirement and would be used by aircrew<br />&bull; Discuss limitations the vendor foresees with the use of their technology on airborne platforms</p>
<p>White papers should discuss their existing technologies (TRL 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9) and, as applicable, discuss the ability to produce, deliver, and sustain existing technologies (TRL 7, 8, or 9) to improve aircrew performance. A rough order magnitude (ROM) of unit cost is desirable.</p>
<p>White papers should indicate if the proposed technology has been sold or licensed to the US Government and/or any other organization or if it has been tested by a DoD Agency or independent third party. Papers should include relevant points of contact for each organization. The white paper should indicate if the technology was developed under a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR), or other government-funded contract vehicle and declare details of the effort including the contract number and funding amount. <br /><br />RESPONSES ARE DUE 17 MARCH 2014 at 03:00 PM EST. White papers should be submitted electronically to Rebecca Koesters and Jessica Tucker via email at Rebecca.Koesters@us.af.mil and Jessica.Tucker.3@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>Responses shall include the following information:</p>
<p>1. Company/Institute name<br />2. Address<br />3. Point of Contact<br />4. Cage Code<br />5. DUNS Number<br />6. Phone Number<br />7. E-mail Address<br />8. Web page URL<br />9. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this action is 334511, size standard 750 employees. Based on the NAICS Code, state whether your company qualifies as a:<br />a. Small Business (Yes/No)<br />b. Woman Owned Small Business (Yes/No) c. Small Disadvantaged Business (Yes/No) d. 8(a) Certified (Yes/No)<br />e. HUB Zone Certified (Yes/No)<br />f. Veteran Owned Small Business (Yes/No)<br />g. Service Disabled Small Business (Yes/No)<br />h. Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business (Yes/No)<br />i. Statement as to whether your company is domestically or foreign owned (if foreign owned, please indicate country of ownership).<br />j. Provide prospective small business utilization percentages (if the acquisition is not set- aside for small business)</p>
<p>Companies may be contacted if we need further information to fully understand the marketplace. AFLCMC is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this RFI in order to assist AFLCMC in determining potential levels of competition available in the industry, as well as helping to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan goal percentages. The acquisition strategy is still being determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition. If it is a small business set-aside, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting will apply. Therefore, small businesses that want to be considered for a small business set-aside should demonstrate how they could comply.</p>
<p>If there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate, and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. If this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Large and small businesses should provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value as well as supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps (FBO) site for additional information pertaining to this RFI.</p>
<p>Respondents should indicate which portions of their responses are proprietary and should make them accordingly. All information received in response to this RFI that is properly marked as "proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Proprietary information must be clearly marked on the outside container and on the materials inside. The Government shall not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages, for any proprietary information not properly identified.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.
<p>Background:<br />The mission of the intramural program of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) at the NIH is to improve human health by providing leadership for development and accelerating the application of biomedical technologies. The Institute is committed to integrating engineering and physical sciences with the life sciences to advance basic research and medical care. The Intramural Research Program plays a key role in fulfilling the Institute's mission, particularly to advance knowledge in imaging and bioengineering research using a combination of basic, translational, and clinical science and to develop effective training programs in related fields.</p>
<p>The Section on High Resolution Optical Imaging at NIBIB, invents new forms of microscopy with better spatial and temporal resolution than is otherwise available. Another priority of the lab is to build microscopes that are gentle and do not otherwise perturb delicate, live biological specimens such as cells and embryos.</p>
<p>The lab has developed a dual-view selective plane illumination microscope (diSPIM) for imaging live specimens, such as the nematode C. elegans, over long periods, at high spatial resolution (330 nm in all 3 dimensions), and with high time resolution, as documented in the recent paper, Wu et al. Nat. Biotechnology, doi: 10.1038/nbt.2713. Although diSPIM is a powerful imaging technique, it suffers from one serious drawback: the sample must be &lsquo;open' to the environment, i.e. it requires the use of an imaging chamber without a top. It is therefore impossible to immobilize live specimens in the same manner that a conventional microscope does, i.e with a conventional microfluidics chip.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: <br />The ultimate goal is to develop an easy to use micro-fluidic platform for high-resolution light sheet microscopy of living adult C. elegans. A requirement for high-resolution analysis of whole live animals is immobilization during imaging and obstruction free visual access for distortion free light sheet microscopy. <br />Image based animal analysis is needed for genetic screens that rely on the expression of fluorescently-tagged molecules to help identify mutants defective in a variety of biological processes, such as germline development1,2 and the regulated degradation of maternal proteins3. Sub-cellular imaging enables researchers to track microtubules in live cells in the context of a whole animal, it enables long term nuclear imaging during nematode embryogenesis and imaging of neural wiring during Caenorhabditis elegans brain development.<br />This proposal requires initial delivery of a simple system without feedback control that positions a live C. elegans over a suction port within a microfluidics system. The xyz- stage on the light sheet microscope would then position the worm relative to the objectives, and controlled suction forces will gently immobilize the animal for obstruction-free whole animal imaging, after which the animal will be released and allowed to further develop for subsequent imaging. If the Government deems it necessary, after evaluating the initial system, the Contractor will combine the microfluidic platform with automated feedback control in which fluid flow will be modulated to position the worms over the suction port, without moving the xyz stage.</p>
<p>Objective1: Demonstrate Proof-of-Principle<br />Contractor will build a C. elegans immobilization device, using a design provided by the Government, that is compatible with dual view plane illumination microscopy, and demonstrate its capability to reliably immobilize adult C. elegans.</p>
<p>Milestone 1: Build prototype for dual view plane illumination microscopy (diSPIM).<br />Milestone 2: NIBIB's lab will validate the fabricated device by using it in conjunction with an existing NIBIB (diSPIM) microscope to generate volumetric images of an immobilized adult C. elegans. Demonstrate animal viability by conventional motion inspection to verify normal movement, feeding, and behavior after trapping.</p>
<p>Objective2: Refine and automate immobilization process<br />The contractor will refine and automate the immobilization mechanism, and demonstrate its capability to repeatedly immobilize a single mature C. elegans over an extended period of time. This system will include capabilities to feed the worm and control water levels in the imaging area.</p>
<p>Milestone 3: Reliably immobilize a single C. elegans every 5 minutes, over a total imaging period of 4 days.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance: 24 weeks starting within 1 week of contract award.</p>
<p>Capability statement/Information sought:</p>
<p>1) Proximity to the NIBIB lab at 13 South Dr Bethesda MD 20814;</p>
<p>2) Evidence of a minimum of 10 years of experience, with microfluidics, including PDMS device fabrication. Provide documentation with either publications or referrals from other labs; and,</p>
<p>3) Evidence of a minimum of 10 years of experience, , working with or in an imaging or imaging-related lab. Provide documentation with either publications or referrals from other labs.</p>
<p>Information Submission Instructions: One copy of the capability statement must be submitted to Jennifer Swift, Contracting Officer, at Jennifer.Swift@nih.gov no later than 3:00 PM February 28, 2014.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>

<DESC><p>This sources sought notice is for planning purposes only and is issued in accordance with FAR Provision 52.215-3 provided at: http://www.acquisition.gov/far/current/html/52_215.html#wp1144503. No solicitation document exists at this time. Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or services to issue a solicitation. In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this notice, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. Any information that the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such. <br /><br />The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Data Buoy Center (NOAA-NDBC) is searching for interested vendors who have the capability to provide towing vessel, crew, fuel, consumables, additional hawser, additional tag lines, and all materials required to disconnect two (2) buoys from their moorings at sea, tow them into port and secure them to a dock.</p>
<p>Background Information: NOAA buoys 12D12 and 12D13 were deployed at stations 42055 and 42056, respectively, in May 2005. They have both been decommissioned as weather stations and now contain only obstruction lights and position transmitters. Upon being decommissioned, they were designated as 42A55 and 42A56, though their towers are still marked with their original station numbers. 42A55 is at 22&deg; 1'2"N, 94&deg; 2'45"W, and 200 nautical miles Northeast of Heroica Veracruz, Mexico. 42A56 is at 19&deg;52'27"N, 85&deg; 3'33"W, 120 nautical miles Southeast of Cancun, QROO, Mexico. On April 19, 2012, NOAA removed all equipment and batteries from 42A55 and installed and GPS tracker and solar powered flashing light (Carmanah 702). On March 28, 2013, NOAA removed all equipment from 42A56 and installed a GPS tracker and solar powered flashing light (Carmanah 702). The buoy still contains 420 air-alkaline batteries (Cegasa AS10-2, approximately 20 pounds each). The tracker normally reports position every 12 hours. NOAA no longer uses this type of buoy and no longer needs these hulls, so their ownership can be transferred to the vendor, and they can be salvaged for scrap metal.</p>
<p>Within 5 days of the buoys' arrival at the dock, NOAA will send two technicians to the docking location to check all buoy compartments for hazardous atmosphere (oxygen and explosive gases) and make the compartments safe to open and enter. NOAA personnel will also remove the obstruction lights and position trackers. See attached Statement of Work (SOW), dated February 13, 2014, for additional information. Also, additional background information can be found on our website at: http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/</p>
<p>Capability Statement Objectives and Requirements: This request is issued for the purpose of exchanging information to improve the understanding of industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and enhancing the Government's ability to obtain services, at reasonable cost and price, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.<br /><br />The NOAA-NDBC is seeking the following information:</p>
<p>1. Experience: Potential respondents shall include in their response relevant experience that is of the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity to that which is described in this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>2. Technical Approach: Potential respondents shall provide capability statements that describe how they would successfully provide the towing vessel, crew, fuel, consumables, additional hawser, additional tag lines, and all materials required to disconnect both buoys from their mooring, bring back in tow at sea, tow them into port and secure them to a dock. Respondents shall include detailed specifications of the vessel/vessels, its equipment and condition offered along with information that demonstrates it meets the requirements in the Statement of Work (SOW), to include the vessel description, including overall length and brake horsepower. <br /><br />3. Business Size: A statement regarding current size of the company under the North American Classification System Code (NAICS) 483111, Deep Sea Freight Transportation, and the small business size standard if 500 employees. The applicable NAICS of 483111 must be included in the vendor's NAICS listing within the System for Award Management (SAM) for NOAA to verify your size status.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government as to<br />how best to solicit (small business set aside or unrestricted) for the proposed procurement based<br />upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. It is, however,<br />anticipated that a solicitation containing this detail will be issued in early to mid April 2014.</p>
<p>Responses to this source sought notice are due via email to kurt.weilbaecher@noaa.gov no later<br />than February 27, 2014 at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time).

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS,OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Mid-Atlantic intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the procurement of electricity generated by an existing renewable energy facility/technology, including but not limited to Solar Photovoltaics (PV), Waste to Energy (including Landfill Gas), Biomass, and Wind for Naval Weapons Station (NWS) Earle consisting of the mainside area located in Colts Neck, New Jersey and the waterfront area located approximately 15 miles north on Sandy Bay.  The intent is to identify potential suppliers and collect information on existing renewable energy systems in the vicinity of the installation.
 NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic desires to solicit maximum industry participation through responses, comments, recommendations, and suggestions, which will allow NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic to formulate an acquisition strategy in a concise and timely manner.

Scope and Objectives:  NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic seeks to purchase renewable power from existing renewable facilities that have been fully developed and operational near NWS Earle. Specific objectives include:

	Purchase electricity from existing renewable energy systems in the capacity range of 2-4 MW-AC, to supplement grid power for a period of 5-10 years with renewal options. Electrical energy from renewable sources must be priced at or below the brown power supply rate that NWS Earle currently pays.
 Over the past year, on average, the installation has paid the electricity supplier an overall rate of approximately $0.069/kWh.

	Provide backup electrical power by investigating possibilities to provide a direct connection from a local renewable energy facility to the NWS Earle electrical distribution system, thereby offering energy security in the event of loss of the local electric utility.  

THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. It is not to be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the government to acquire any products or services. This synopsis is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential suppliers prior to determining the method of acquisition and ultimate issuance of an award.
 The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from the potential sources as a result of this synopsis. It is requested that interested suppliers submit to the Contracting Officer a capabilities statement package.  The response to this RFI is not to exceed 10 pages, using 12 point Times New Roman font, single spaced with 1-inch margins on standard 8-1/2 by 11-inch paper.  SUBMITTALS IN EXCESS OF THE 10 PAGE LIMIT WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. 

NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic seeks the following information:
1.	Company profile to include size/number of employees, office location(s), active SAM registration, available bonding capacity, DUNS number, CAGE code, small business designation/status claimed.
  If a small business, please also provide information on which, if any, of the sub-categories of small business (certified by SBA as a HUBZoneSB, self-certify as either a SDB, WOSB, VOSB, and/or SDVOSB) you qualify. 
2.	A description of the existing renewable facility and an estimated cost of electricity per kWh to the Navy both with and without a direct electrical connection to NWS Earle.  Detailed cost estimates are not required or desired.
3.	Points of Contact (POC) for the existing renewable facility to include name, title, phone number and email address.
4.	Additional information, if any, that the responder believes is relevant.

RESPONSES ARE DUE NLT March 14, 2014 11:59 PM EST. LATE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.
 Response to this Sources Sought is not required in order to respond to any future RFP that may follow.  However, information gathered through this solicitation may influence RFP development.  The package shall be sent either by mail or by email only.  FAX inputs are not allowed nor will be accepted.

<CONTACT>Melissa Hergenrader, Phone 4022943862, Email Melissa.Hergenrader@offutt.af.mil
<DESC>55 CONS/LGCZ, Offutt AFB, NE intends to award a 7-month sole source extension for the USTRATCOM Command and Control Software Engineering and Support III (C2SES III) task order under the authority of FAR 6-302.1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The 7-month effort does not include a transition for a new contractor to continue the effort and the requirement demonstrates a unique and innovative concept. The task order issued under the ENCORE II MAC IDIQ provides Software Engineering Support to the USSTRATCOM Command and Control systems including Force Status/Readiness (FSR), The Global Information Grid (GIG) Area of Responsibility (AOR) Decision Support System (GADSS), Force Survivability, Analysis and Management (FSAM) and the Nuclear Planning and Execution System (NPES).
<p>The C2SES II provides to the Commander (CDR) USSTRATCOM, Component Commanders and USSTRATCOM war fighters, supported Combatant Commands, and other authorized users with modernized Command and Control capabilities, a fully synchronized, net-centric information environment, and the common integrated information and decision toolsets, applications and capabilities necessary to maintain deterrence and, if required, dominate in conflict. The C2SES II contract provides total lifecycle management of these systems, applications and toolsets, as well as any future enhancements, upgrades and/or replacements.<br />The systems included for C2SES II support are:</p>
<p>Nuclear Planning and Execution System (NPES)<br />NPES Strategic Data Loader (NSDL)<br />Force Status and Readiness (FSR)<br />Command and Control Enterprise Database (C2EDB)<br />Global Information Grid (GIG)/ Area of Responsibility (AOR) Decision Support System (GADSS)<br />Force Survivability, Analysis and Management (FSAM)</p>
<p>Technical requirements will not be completed by the end of the current period of performance on the C2SES II task order on 31 March 2016. The 7-month extension allows for the extension of the C2SES II task order to 31 Oct 2016 per FAR 6.302-1. The rationale for this request is to complete the conversion of all of the C2capabilities to operate in the X86/commodity server architecture, an ongoing 4 year conversion project.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Government intends to extend, for 7 months, the current C2SES II Task Order period of performance until 31 Oct 2016 to allow time for completion of current effort. This notice is neither a request for a competitive proposal or a solicitation for offerors. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement is based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government. If your company can provide the C2SES II services at full performance starting 1 Apr 2016, provide a capability package to the Contract Specialist by the response date, 14 Mar 14.</p>

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of the St. Jude Medical IPG Stimulator for Spinal Cord Stimulation at the WPAFB Medical Treatment Facility (MTF). The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c).<br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 334510. Size standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />The proposed source is St Jude Medical, Inc., One St. Jude Medical Drive , St. Paul, MN 55117-9983. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received within one (1) day of this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br /><br />In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires the St. Jude Medical IPG Stimulator for Spinal Cord Stimulation on 20 Feb 2014 to be performed at the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) at Wright Patterson AFB (WPAFB). The patient has had multiple spinal surgeries with no change in pain level. The patient has also failed all other methods of conservative treatment for pain moderation besides the IPG Stimulator. The IPG Stimulator will reduce pain in the patient whereas all other treatments could not. The Neuro surgeon has trained using the St. Jude IPG Stimulator and if these items are not used the surgery would need to be sent off base at a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.<br /><br />The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM at 866-606-8220. SAM website: www.SAM.gov<br />

<SOLNBR>HT9402_REQUEST_FOR_INFORMATION_RFI
<RESPDATE>030414
<CONTACT>Judith L. Blomquist, Phone 3036763839, Email Judith.Blomquist.ctr@tma.osd.mil
<DESC>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is contemplating a new, single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Fixed Unit Price Contract for the TRICARE Dental Program (TDP). The TDP provides dental coverage to Active Duty family members, members of the Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) and their family members. The period of performance is anticipated to be a transition-in phase of one year, plus five one-year options; however DHA is exploring the possibility of a longer performance period.
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback on capabilities currently available to meet the attached TDP requirement. The North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) Class Code is 524114.</p>
<p>To assist with industry's feedback we are posting a redacted version of the current contract.</p>
<p>The Intent of this RFI is to accomplish two things:</p>
<p>1. Request information from potential offerors to be utilized by the DHA Dental Program Office to support its continuous market research regarding upcoming TDP requirements. Iinformation provided will not be utilized for any purpose other than for market research; and <br />2. Potentially invite offerors that respond by the due date as specified in this RFI, for one-on one sessions to assist in determining the proper acquisition strategy for the TDP.</p>
<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>DHA is contemplating the award of a contract utilizing a full and open competition for providing dental coverage to all eligible family members of Uniformed Service active duty personnel and to members of the Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) and their eligible family members. Active duty service members, former spouses, parents, in-laws, disabled veterans, foreign personnel, and retirees and their families are not eligible for the TDP. For purposes of this contract, the geographic area of coverage for the Continental United States (CONUS) includes the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) service area includes Canada, all other countries, island masses and territorial waters.</p>
<p>The following services are anticipated to be the major part of the contract's scope:<br />&bull; Provide dentist networks in the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands.<br />&bull; Claims processing and reimbursement<br />&bull; Customer service<br />&bull; Beneficiary and provider education</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: Please review and provide responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. How does your commercial business process phase-out of claims when a contract ends and you are not the successful offeror on the next contract? Do you turn over residual claims to the incoming contractor or do you process the claim to completion? If you do turn over residual claims to the incoming contractor at what point do you turn them over?</p>
<p>2. When you are awarded a contract for services previously provided by another contractor, does your commercial business process claims (adjudication, appeals, etc) when care was rendered on the previous contract? If not, was this a negotiated process during transition?</p>
<p>3. Eligibility for TDP enrollment is driven by the service member's military status as reported to DEERS. There are cases where the service member's military status is updated and can retroactively change plan type enrollment eligibility back a number of months or years. Depending on the status change, premiums may need to be refunded, claims payment recouped, or collection of additional premiums. What is your experience with retroactive enrollments and disenrollments within a program? Do your commercial plans have set retroactive enrollment policies?</p>
<p>4. What is your annual maximum on your commercial plans? Our market research indicates that commercial plans exceed TDP's $1,300 annual maximum. How do your commercial plans offer a higher annual maximum while maintaining lower premiums? Are your benefit plans more restrictive than TDP's? What are your key risk mitigations that help you control costs? What percentage of beneficiaries exceeds the annual maximum on your commercial plans? What are your thoughts on increasing the TDP annual maximum of $1,300 to be more in alignment with commercial plans?</p>
<p>5. Please provide a comparison (list similarities and differences) between the TDP benefit and your commercial plans. If you have a FedVIP plan and/or other Government plan, please provide a comparison of benefits with it too.</p>
<p>6. What has been your experience with contracts longer than 6 years (Transition-In period plus 5 option periods)? What are your thoughts on the TDP contract period being 10 years (Transition-In period plus 9 option periods)? How many option periods beyond the Transition-In period do you consider to be reasonable? What is the maximum period of time you can predict premiums beyond 5 years?</p>
<p>7. Currently the TDP contractor is responsible for providing the content of educational materials with the Government furnishing the printing of the materials. The TDP contractor is responsible for the distribution of the Government-furnished materials. What are your thoughts on the contractor being responsible for printing the materials? What would be the cost impact on the contract? If more materials are distributed electronically, how would this impact you? What are your thoughts on the Government handling all of the electronic distribution? How do your commercial plans handle the beneficiary notifications to opt in or opt out of receiving information electronically?</p>
<p>8. What are your current orthodontic benefits for adults? What are your thoughts on increasing TDP's orthodontic benefit age limit to 35 or 40 years of age? Do you think there should be a reduced amount of coverage for anyone over 23 years of age? How much risk do your actuaries see in this benefit?</p>
<p>9. What is your current orthodontic, prosthodontics, implant services and other restorative care benefit for beneficiaries residing overseas? What would be the impact of making these TDP benefits the same for CONUS and OCONUS beneficiaries? If this change were to be made for the next contract what would be the implications on grandfathering in those OCONUS beneficiaries that are already in treatment?</p>
<p>10. TDP currently offers only Single and Family plans. Commercial plans, FedVIP and TRDP offer Single, Self+1, and Family plans. Would there be any program and/or cost implications if TDP were to offer this too?</p>
<p>11. The Government is considering the removal of the following requirement.</p>
<p>C.7.6.2. The Contractor shall pay the claims generated when CONUS enrollees use non-network providers (minus the appropriate cost-share) at the lesser of: (1) billed charges; or (2) prevailing charges at the 50th percentile for that geographic area using data derived from the most current version available of the Prevailing Health Care Charges System&reg;, from FAIR Health (formerly Ingenix) at http://www.fairhealthus.org/ at the time the claim is adjudicated except when the requirements of C.7.5.3 and C.7.5.3.2, and/or C.7.6.2.1 are applicable. The Contractor will update their system with the Fair Health information annually.</p>
<p>What would be the impact on your business operations? What would be the cost implications?</p>
<p>12. The Government is considering adding OCONUS claims processing standards. If you have experience in processing OCONUS claims, what do you consider to be the average timeline for processing OCONUS claims? Do you foresee any unusual circumstances that would need to be considered for these standards?</p>
<p>RESPONSES REQUIRED:</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI should be no more than 25 pages total including the cover page. This page limit does not apply to the comparison of benefits stated in #5 above. Please submit responses to Judith.Blomquist@dha.mil and Janice.McLeod@dha.mil no later than March 4, 2014. Responses that are not submitted in a timely manner may prevent your company from being invited to participate in a one-on-one meeting. Include with your responses a point of contact (name, title, address, phone/fax, email) that DHA can contact regarding a one-on-one meeting at DHA-Aurora, Colorado. The one-on-one is tentatively scheduled for March 12 - 13, 2014. The Government anticipates the sessions to be no longer than two hours each and offers the option to conduct in-person or by telephone. Please indicate in your response your preferred day, your preference for morning or afternoon, and whether you want to conduct it in-person or by telephone. We will accommodate on a first-come, first-serve basis. Those taking this opportunity should be prepared to discuss any minor and/or major issues along with any significant cost drivers.</p>

<DESC>Provisions set forth by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) &sect; 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii) (A) authorizes the use of brand name only supplies in solicitations/contracts when supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a contract requiring the use of highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. As such, for the purposes described hereunder and in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, coupled with the Authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), the Army Corps of Engineers, Chicago District intends to issue a competitive solicitation that will include brand name only items. Specifically, the winning contractor will be required to purchase the following brand name Critical Systems in support of MCCOOK RESERVIOR DISTRIBUTION TUNNEL SYSTEM REPAIRS CONTRACT:
<p>&bull; Sump Pump Replacement - Replacing Flygt pumps (4 each), a unit of Xylem Water Solutions, to Gorman-Rupp pumps (2 each),<br />&bull; Elevator Repairs - Alimak Hek Group AB (Lump Sum)<br />&bull; Electrical Switchgear Repairs - Siemens Corporation (Lump Sum),<br />&bull; Heating and Ventilation System Repairs - Carrier, a unit of United Technologies Corp. (Lump Sum),<br />&bull; Critical Systems also include support equipment required to facilitate repairs to said Critical Systems, which includes the Overhead Bridge Crane repairs - Konecranes (Lump Sum).</p>
<p>Note: Critical Systems are defined as components that are in either intermittent or continuous operation and that would cause additional failures within the McCook Reservoir Distribution Tunnel System (DTS) should they no longer become operational.</p>
<p>The use of the original manufacturer of materials and components is required to prevent issues of system functionality and extensive additional costs. The use of any other manufacturer would cause a need to replace in essence complete parts and accessories thus creating complete new systems. Therefore, the future contract will need to use brand name descriptions peculiar to one manufacturer for a specific system with whom a turn-key solution can be provided meeting all government requirements.</p>
<p>The government has already developed plans and specifications to rehabilitate the Distribution Tunnel System (DTS) and intends to utilize competitive procedures for the future solicitation/contract of the construction project requiring the brand name only components. The future solicitation will be numbered as W912P6-14-R-0010 and competed as a small business set aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for the project is 237990 with a small business size in dollars of $33.5M.</p>
<p><br />Interested parties may identify their interest and submit clearly articulated product information. Product information lacking the particular features that do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, this agency's needs cannot be considered. Interested firms may submit their interest and information from the date of this notice until 5:30p.m. CDT on 28 February 2014 via email to Ms. Kim Beard at kim.m.beard@usace.army.mil with a copy furnished to Regina Blair at regina.g.blair@usace.army.mil.

It is the responsibility of your firm to determine the size of its electronic file.<br /><br />The posting of this Notice satisfies the provisions set forth at Subpart 5.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>

<DESC>Headquarters, United States Special Operations Command (HQ USSOCOM), Special Operation Research and Development Acquisition Center (SORDAC), Program Executive Office for Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (PEO-C4) intends to extend the Special Operations Forces (SOF) Information Technology Enterprise Contracts (SITEC) Distributed Computing Tower ordering period by 12 months by adding one additional 1-year option ordering period along with an increase in the overall contract ceiling. The SITEC Distributed Computing Tower is a single award contract competitively awarded under solicitation H92222-10-R-0034 in 2011. The Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract was awarded with a one-year base ordering period and three 1-year option ordering periods (four years total). The contractor is L-3 National Security Solutions Inc.
<p>The extension will provide time for PEO-C4 to plan the realignment of all the SITEC Towers to more efficiently provide information technology services across the expanding global SOF enterprise. This extension, to be executed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), will ensure the continued support of existing Distributed Computing tasks thru 2016. The planned extension will include all scope and provisions contained in the SITEC Distributed Computing Tower IDIQ contract and Performance Work Statement. By extending the ordering period, HQ USSOCOM will strategically align its IT service based contracts to minimize duplication of cost and unacceptable delays in providing IT services while reorganizing the multiple technical IT services areas (Towers) to provide enhanced flexibility to meet changing current and future IT program requirements.</p>

<p>(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) Are, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) Have, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) Are, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the acquisition official if there is a change in provider.<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer. In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.<br />The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.<br />Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>STATEMENT OF NEED: Propane for Fritz Peak Observatory</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Chemical Sciences Division (CSD) of NOAA/OAR/ESRL maintains for atmospheric observations a remote facility called the Fritz Peak Observatory, located near Rollinsville, CO. Scientific work is conducted on a sporadic basis, so the facility needs to be available on short notice. As such, constant maintenance, upkeep, and utilities are needed year-round. The facility is heated by, and produces hot water by, a propane-fired boiler system. Since the facility is located at an elevation of ~9000 feet above sea level a constant supply of propane is required to ensure against water pipes bursting.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE<br />The objective of CSD is to ensure an uninterrupted and adequate supply of propane to the facility.</p>
<p>SCOPE<br />The Contractor is responsible for supplying propane to the Fritz Peak Observatory, 19126 State Highway 119, Blackhawk, CO 80422 (located near Rollinsville, CO). The total amount of propane to be delivered for this requirement is between 100 and 500 gallons per month (varies seasonally; ~5,000 gallons annually). Regular deliveries will be supplemented by occasional emergency deliveries, as needed.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />The base period of performance for this requirement is 12 months, beginning March 1, 2014 and ending February 28, 2015, with the option to extend up to four additional years.</p>
<p>PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br />All deliveries are to be made to the Fritz Peak Observatory, 19126 State Highway 119, Blackhawk, CO 80422 (located near Rollinsville, CO). The point of delivery is the propane storage tank located to the rear of the main building.</p>
<p>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS<br />The propane delivered shall be of a quality commensurate with residential and commercial heating purposes, similar to specifications in the attachment. The Contractor shall check the fill status of the propane storage tank periodically (approximately twice per month) to ensure an adequate supply of propane is always on hand.</p>
<p>All propane will be delivered to the storage tank located to the rear of the main building. The tank will be filled in accordance with standard industry safety practices. The site is generally not manned, so deliveries can be made without a facility representative present. Delivery notices should be mailed to the administrative assistant point of contact shown below.</p>
<p>If this contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and the agency technical contact shown below shall coordinate the initial delivery to ensure the Contractor understands the location of the delivery point. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of the propane tank running dry, causing damage to the facility.</p>
<p>SAFETY AND SECURITY<br />All rules concerning safety, not smoking, and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>POINTS OF CONTACT<br />To be provided at time of award.</p>
<p>INVOICING<br />The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's propane deliveries and related surcharges and fees. The invoice must include the following items:<br />1. Name and address of the contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order;<br />2. Invoice date and invoice number;<br />3. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order;<br />4. Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of supplies delivered, and date of delivery;<br />5. Evidence of delivery by way of receipt;<br />6. Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice (a defective invoice is one that does not meet all the above requirements).</p>
<p>The invoices will be sent to the following address:<br />Administrative Officer<br />NOAA/ESRL/CSD1<br />325 Broadway<br />Boulder, CO 80305<br />&emsp;</p>

Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote. 
(b) QUOTE PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS The quotation shall consist of two parts: (1) technical submission and (2) price information. 
Technical Acceptability - The technical proposal shall consist of descriptive information (including equipment drawing and complete specifications) regarding the items identified in the solicitation. This information may include product literature or other narrative describing the products to be provided. The information provided should be presented in such a manner as to enable the Government to make a thorough and complete evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether or not the products proposed and described will satisfy the requirements of the Government as stated in the solicitation. <BR> <BR>Selection of a vendor for award will be based on two parts, as follows: 
(1) Technical Acceptability: The technical information submitted by each offeror will be evaluated against the specifications provided in the solicitation line item description, INSTRUCTIONS TO QUOTERS, and EVALUATION OF QUOTES and determined to either pass or fail. If the technical proposal is determined "fail", it renders the entire proposal technically unacceptable. If a technical rating of "fail" is assigned, the vendor may no longer be considered for award. The Contracting Officer will evaluate products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. 
(2) Price - The vendor's proposed prices will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness. 
The PCO will review all of the proposals. Upon completion of the above, a single award for all items will be made to the offeror whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is considered technically acceptable, i.e. received a "pass" evaluation for Technical Acceptability and whose offer is considered to be the lowest price. (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

To provide the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center (WCSC) with comprehensive monthly U.S. foreign transportation data similar to manifest data collected by U.S. Customs Border and Protection (Customs) or the Bills of Lading filed by the ship lines to Customs for all U.S. imports, exports and in-transit waterborne commerce to and from foreign countries.  <br>  <br> 2)	Background.  On September 28, 1998 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) as the  quote mark central collection agency quote mark  for the U.S. Foreign Waterborne Transportation Statistics Program (FWTSP) effective October 1, 1998.  The U.S. Bureau of the Census (Census) was previously responsible for this program. This decision followed a review of the U.S. Foreign Waterborne Transportation Statistics program at the direction of OMB.  The Corps collects and publishes the data pursuant to its authority under the 1922 River and Harbor Act (33 U.S.C. 555) by which it has historically collected and published waterborne commerce statistics.  <br>  <br> The FWTSP requires manifest data that provides the associated cargo and vessel movement transaction data upfront, unlike trade data.  In-transit records are included in the manifest dataset, which are movements of foreign cargo through the U.S. from one foreign country to another foreign country.  Inbound waterborne in-transits enter the U.S. via marine vessel and outbound waterborne in-transits exit the U.S. via marine vessel. <br>  <br> 3)	Tasks: The data provided to WCSC shall include information where available on the date and trade direction; carrier and shipment details; cargo, weight and container details; product descriptions and codes; geographic indicators; shippers, consignees and notify parties; and processing information. The minimum data elements to be included in the database are provided below. The coded data items shall be compatible with the data furnished by Customs. The reported commodity description shall be coded to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule commodity codes. The data shall be sent in electronic format. Updated information to previously delivered data shall be provided.  <br>  <br> 4)	Considerations.  Purchase of these data by the USACE constitutes purchase to a government agency.  As such, the data may be used internally by any USACE office without violating any copyright restrictions.   <br>  <br> 5)	Deliverables and Schedule.  The data are to be delivered via FTP monthly, not later than six weeks after the close of the month.  The data files shall be provided by month and direction with record structure(s) included.  Inbound/outbound in-transit records shall be included within the import/export files.  WCSC shall be provided field definitions and notified of any changes to the record layout or imputed data (data derived from other fields). Import and export fields should have the same field name, field type, field size, and field definitions except for those fields that are only applicable for either imports or exports. <br> Data Elements and Descriptions <br>  <br> Direction:  Denotes cargo direction for exports (waterborne cargoes exiting the U.S. including outbound in-transits) and imports (waterborne cargoes entering the U.S. including inbound in-transits).  <br>  <br> Date:  For U.S. exports, this would be the date the vessel left the U.S. port.

For imports, the ultimate origin would be the origin point, the original place where the steamship line accepts the cargo and could be 1) an inland point, 2) a deepwater port where the cargo is first loaded before being transshipped at the foreign port, or 3) the same as the foreign port.  The code is based on the Schedule K. <br>  <br> U.S. Customs Clearing Point:  For imports only.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 11 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Field Program Manager - Syria is a member of the DCHA/OTI Middle East Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, and can be based anywhere in the world, but must be immediately available for frequent and possibly long-term temporary duty assignments to the Syria region.  The incumbent may be required to live in temporary quarters or in a hotel in a neighboring country for indefinite periods until the situation in Syria is stabilized.  The incumbent must be prepared for uncertainty in regards to the length of time that will be required to remain in the Syria region.</p>
<p>The Field Program Manager's principal responsibility is to support the OTI country team in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>The OTI Syria program will support the larger objectives of the U.S. Government to promote stability and democracy in Syria by providing assistance to support the political transition. In close coordination with the State Department representatives and other USG actors and with consideration of USG priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Field Program Manager in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Field Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Field Program Manager requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The Field Program Manager is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. S/he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Field Program Manager is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Field Program Manager has a strong sense of responsibility, is service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Field Program Manager is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee (e.g. the OTI Deputy Country Representative), the Field Program Manager will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the OTI Country Team and implementing partner staff in the development and design of small grant activities, ensuring that they are in line with the overall program strategy.</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the OTI Country Team in the overall monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) of OTI-sponsored activities in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Draft weekly and quarterly programmatic and analytical political reports incorporating information from OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support the OTI Country Team on USAID and OTI administrative requirements (travel assistance, including notifications to the Embassy/Consulate and bookings, budget preparation and tracking, financial management,  procurement, and motor pool operations);</p>
<p>&bull;	Maintain detailed records/files of program information;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in supervising, training and/or mentoring Foreign National PSC (FNPSC) OTI staff; implementing staff, and locally hired teams;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in coordinating with implementing partner staff to help ensure team goals and objectives are being met and are understood by all, even during rapid periods of change;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in meeting and collaborating with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, implementing partners, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, international donors, and others key players who may be interested in OTI activities or who have important information related to the start up or ongoing development of OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in regularly communicating and sharing program information with other USAID project managers, bilateral donors, U.N. organizations, international organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate and present lessons learned to audiences such as US Government officials, local government officials, other donor officials, and others as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as Acting OTI Deputy Country Representative or Country Representative as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	If required, assist in developing an exit strategy that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs.</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by Embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick impact programming model. Support to Embassies and USAID Missions may also include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including but not limited to rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews and management reviews.</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The OTI Field Program Manager will report to OTI's Country Representative in the assigned country or to his/her designee (for example, the Deputy Country Representative).</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>While in the country of assignment, the work is generally performed in an office environment.

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>OFDA has been responding to humanitarian needs resulting from the conflict in Syria since February 2012.  The United States Government (USG) has allocated over $1.3 billion in humanitarian assistance to support humanitarian programs.  These programs are currently being managed by a DART, located in Turkey and Jordan, and an RMT in Washington, DC.  USAID anticipates significant additional humanitarian programming for FY2014 and beyond, managed either by the DART and RMT or by OFDA's Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia (EMCA) Team.</p>
<p>The OFDA Response Teams in Turkey, Jordan, and Washington are responsible for coordinating the USG's humanitarian response to Syria, establishing programs to meet clearly defined humanitarian needs, and for overseeing OFDA's current and future humanitarian assistance programming (which is expected to approach one-half billion dollars in FY14).  OFDA has Team Leaders in both Turkey and Jordan, each managing staff, programs, and operations in those respective countries. The Syria Response Team Leader for Jordan is responsible for managing all OFDA response activities for Syria that originate from Jordan.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>OFDA has been responding to humanitarian needs resulting from the conflict in Syria since February 2012.  The US Government (USG) has allocated over $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to support humanitarian programs.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>OFDA has been responding to humanitarian needs resulting from the conflict in Syria since February 2012.  The United States Government (USG) has allocated over $1.3 billion in humanitarian assistance to support humanitarian programs.  These programs are currently being managed by a DART, located in Turkey and Jordan, and an RMT in Washington, DC.  USAID anticipates significant additional humanitarian programming for FY2014 and beyond, managed either by the DART and RMT or by OFDA's Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia (EMCA) Team.</p>
<p>The OFDA Response Teams in Turkey, Jordan, and Washington are responsible for coordinating the USG's humanitarian response to Syria, establishing programs to meet clearly defined humanitarian needs, and for overseeing OFDA's current and future humanitarian assistance programming (which is expected to approach one-half billion dollars by the end of FY14).  OFDA has Team Leaders in both Turkey and Jordan, each managing staff, programs, and operations in those respective countries. This solicitation is for the Planning Coordinator in Turkey, who monitors OFDA-funded programs, liaises with the IO and NGO community, provides assessments when appropriate, and makes program recommendations.

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>OFDA has been responding to humanitarian needs resulting from the conflict in Syria since February 2012.  The US Government (USG) has allocated over $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to support humanitarian programs.  These programs are currently being managed by a DART, located in Turkey and Jordan, and an RMT in Washington, DC.  USAID anticipates significant additional humanitarian programming for FY2014 and beyond, managed either by the DART and RMT or by OFDA's Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia (EMCA) Team.</p>
<p>The OFDA Response Teams in Turkey, Jordan, and Washington are responsible for coordinating the USG's humanitarian response to Syria, establishing programs to meet clearly defined humanitarian needs, and for overseeing OFDA's current and future humanitarian assistance programming (which is expected to approach one-half billion dollars in FY14).  OFDA has Team Leaders in both Turkey and Jordan, each managing staff, programs, and operations in those respective countries.  This solicitation is for the Liaison Officer in Ankara, Turkey.

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] List end products. <BR> <BR>(2) Certification.

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that? (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies? (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <BR> <BR>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 11 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Field Program Manager - Syria is a member of the DCHA/OTI Middle East Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, and can be based anywhere in the world, but must be immediately available for frequent and possibly long-term temporary duty assignments to the Syria region.  The incumbent may be required to live in temporary quarters or in a hotel in a neighboring country for indefinite periods until the situation in Syria is stabilized.  The incumbent must be prepared for uncertainty in regards to the length of time that will be required to remain in the Syria region.</p>
<p>The Field Program Manager's principal responsibility is to support the OTI country team in the development, oversight and management of the OTI country program.</p>
<p>The OTI Syria program will support the larger objectives of the U.S. Government to promote stability and democracy in Syria by providing assistance to support the political transition. In close coordination with the State Department representatives and other USG actors and with consideration of USG priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate conflict, increase transparency and accountability, and foster positive political change.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Field Program Manager in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Field Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Field Program Manager requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The Field Program Manager is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. S/he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Field Program Manager is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.

<p>&bull;	Assist in regularly communicating and sharing program information with other USAID project managers, bilateral donors, U.N. organizations, international organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>OFDA has been responding to humanitarian needs resulting from the conflict in Syria since February 2012.  The United States Government (USG) has allocated over $1.3 billion in humanitarian assistance to support humanitarian programs.

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>OFDA has been responding to humanitarian needs resulting from the conflict in Syria since February 2012.  The US Government (USG) has allocated over $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to support humanitarian programs.  These programs are currently being managed by a DART, located in Turkey and Jordan, and an RMT in Washington, DC.  USAID anticipates significant additional humanitarian programming for FY2014 and beyond, managed either by the DART and RMT or by OFDA's Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia (EMCA) Team.</p>
<p>The OFDA Response Teams in Turkey, Jordan, and Washington are responsible for coordinating the USG's humanitarian response to Syria, establishing programs to meet clearly defined humanitarian needs, and for overseeing OFDA's current and future humanitarian assistance programming (which is expected to approach one-half billion dollars by the end of FY14).

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>

It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps (FBO) site for additional information pertaining to this Sources Sought.</p>
<p>Note that, if there is sufficient demonstrated interested and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a small business set-aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and what type of businesses will be used for subcontracting (other than small business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business Zone small business (HUBZone). Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Note that, if this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought is strictly voluntary. This Sources Sought does not constitute a Request For Proposal or an Invitation for Bid. Sources Sought issuance does not restrict the Government's ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought.</p>

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of the St. Jude Medical IPG Stimulator for Spinal Cord Stimulation at the WPAFB Medical Treatment Facility (MTF). The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c).<br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 334510. Size standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />The proposed source is St Jude Medical, Inc., One St. Jude Medical Drive , St. Paul, MN 55117-9983. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received within&nbsp;five (5) days of this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br /><br />In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires the St. Jude Medical IPG Stimulator for Spinal Cord Stimulation on 20 Feb 2014 to be performed at the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) at Wright Patterson AFB (WPAFB). The patient has had multiple spinal surgeries with no change in pain level. The patient has also failed all other methods of conservative treatment for pain moderation besides the IPG Stimulator. The IPG Stimulator will reduce pain in the patient whereas all other treatments could not. The Neuro surgeon has trained using the St. Jude IPG Stimulator and if these items are not used the surgery would need to be sent off base at a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.<br /><br />The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM at 866-606-8220. SAM website: www.SAM.gov<br />

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF MARKET SURVEY:  <br>    <br> THIS RFI WITH ADDITIONAL GRAPHICS CAN BE FOUND AT THE LINK BELOW:  <br> https://contracting.tacom.army.mil/ssn/sources.htm  <br>  <br> PURPOSE OF AMENDMENT 001: To include updated points of contact to address questions regarding the market survey.  All questions shall be submitted via email. <br>  <br> **Please address any questions regarding this market survey via email to: scott.m.rogan.civ@mail.mil and nathan.s.fountain.civ@mail.mil; include name, phone number and email address for a response.  Questions may be answered via email or phone. <br>    <br> This is a market survey Request for Information (RFI) in support of the development of a Modular Active Protection Systems (MAPS) Framework (MAF).  This RFI is issued pursuant to FAR 15.2. The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC) Warren, MI, on behalf of the U.S. Army, desires to obtain information on key features for a MAPS Framework (MAF) as a development platform for the Army Survivability community.  In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e.), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No contract will be awarded as a result of this RFI.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation documents exist at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.  Although  quote mark proposal quote mark  and  quote mark offeror quote mark  are used in this Request for Information, all responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.  This solicitation is for the purpose of socializing the MAF concept with Industry and receiving input to guide the step-wise development which will culminate in the incorporation of COTS/MOTS equipment which is MAF compliant.  <br>    <br> MAPS OVERVIEW:  <br>    <br> The intent of the MAPS Program is to design, develop, and test a MAPS Controller (MAC) and a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA)-based Open Architecture that integrates multiple APS material solutions / configurations in a manner that results in significant reductions in overall cost, schedule, and risk.  The MAPS program will specify, validate, demonstrate, and maintain the MOSA-based system architecture, known as the MAPS Framework (MAF), for the integration of Active Protection System (APS) components, i.e. sensors, countermeasures, and related items of equipment on US Army ground vehicle platforms.  The goals are to optimize requirements, improve on technology transitions, and provide evolutionary growth in capabilities.  MAF standards will be developed in cooperation with industry and will be open to support multi-vendor implementation.  It is the intent for these standards to be used in future acquisition of active protection system components.  Implementation of the Modular APS Framework (MAF) allows platform systems to share and customize APS suites and to accept future technologies without the need for significant re-design.    <br>    <br> TOPIC:  <br>    <br> The Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) Ground System Survivability (GSS) group is conducting a market survey soliciting information from industry concerning existing, proven technology solutions to develop a MAF baseline.  The baseline will consist of Computing and Interface hardware, the Modular APS Controller (MAC), in addition to MAF-conformant software architecture.  TARDEC will use the MAF design concept and open standards to develop a lab-based prototype MAPS, to support system and subsystem software development, testing, and demonstrations.  TARDEC plans to eventually acquire and host 3rd party developed MAF-conformant hardware and software components in the MAPS Lab to analyze acquisition strategies, system integration (i.e. software and hardware validation and test) and evaluate safety (AFSRB) certification implications.  Responses will help inform the determination of MAPS interoperability profiles used in future MAPS acquisition performance specifications and requirement documents.  <br>    <br> The MAF is envisioned to include:  <br>    <br>  -- An architecture, which defines common terminology, systems, components, and interfaces.   <br>    <br>  -- Set of reference designs.  <br>    <br>  -- A phased set of standard specifications covering the capabilities needed to integrate MAPS mission equipment /configuration items (CIs), platform applications and interfaces.  <br>    <br>  -- Open standard physical and logical interfaces among system and APS components  <br>    <br>  -- Set of shared communication services.  <br>    <br>  -- Common and approved hardware and software information assurance (IA) components to enable systems integrators to build security designs that protect and control access to information in compliance with the Army IA regulations.  <br>    <br>  -- Joint Service Weapon Safety Review Board reviewed safety approaches (although each Hardware, Software and Firmware configuration will be approved and certified)  <br>    <br>  A Government-Industry standards body will develop the MAF standard specifications.  This body follows an  quote mark adopt-adapt-author quote mark  methodology in the effort to move towards establishing a set of common open standards for use within the vehicle and mission system communities. These standards will be independent of specific hardware, software or firmware solutions.  <br>    <br>  Modular and open hardware configuration is intended to mean:  <br>    <br>  -- Deploy software i.e. addition of Software Configuration Items (SCI's) and applications (SLOC and throughput growth) w/o adding or replacing Hardware Configuration Items (HCIs).  <br>    <br>  -- Deploy hardware additions while enabling software reuse.  <br>    <br>  -- Modular hardware design counts for: Reconfigurable I/Os, power channels, signals, discretes, multiple interface protocols, busses bandwidth, CPU throughput, memory types and total budget used vs. reserve values to support growth.  <br>    <br>  -- Provide for low, medium, or high level of protection hardware solutions.  <br>    <br>  -- Integrated Electronics Environment that supports LRM designs with spare backplane slots.  <br>    <br>  -- Capable of self test (ST, BIT/BID), report and fault isolate to its line replaceable module and component's malfunctions.  <br>    <br>  -- Supports and interact with the host Vehicle's Health Management System (VHMS).  <br>    <br>  Conceptual Architectural Diagrams  <br>    <br>  Refer to Figure-1:  The MAF will include a Modular APS Controller (MAC) and will provide and define the primary interfaces and controls between the APS sensors, the counter measures, switching devices and the host vehicle.  Both Conceptual Architecture represented in Figure 2 and 3 are notional and they currently under evaluations by the USG.  The interested parties are encouraged to provide us with feedback comments, enhancements, Pros/Cons on both concepts, and their design concept.  <br>    <br> The MAC may perform all critical processing such as target / threat classification, tracking of all direct-fire threats from a ground based adversary, 360 degrees, and countermeasure activation, as in Figure 2.  Alternately, the MAC may perform minimal processing and act as a system arbitrator for the activation of countermeasures and provide an interface between the system and the host vehicle/system operator as in Figure 3.  <br>    <br> Communication Protocol Options  <br>    <br> A significant task in the development of the MAF will be the selection of communication protocols.  This selection will be influenced by factors such as latency/ bandwidth, security/information assurance, and scalability.  It is not expected that the architecture will have only a single protocol for everything APS.  Rather, responses to this RFI will shed light on the system requirements and data transfer needs which will drive the protocol selection.  Additionally, this selection will be impacted by existing APS communication protocols and the potential impact to existing industry technology.  Protocol selection will also be influenced by safety requirements of the Army Fuse Safety Review Board (AFSRB) which must certify these systems.  The Government is investigating the following candidates believed capable of gigabit per second performance:  <br>    <br>    1) IEEE 802.3 based AFDX / ARINC 664 Part 7  <br>    <br>    2) IEEE 1394b based SAE AS5643A (@ S800)  <br>    <br>    3) TTE based SAE AS6802   <br>    <br>    4) IEEE 802.3 and IETF COTS internet based  <br>    <br> Communication Considerations  <br>    <br>  -- The MAF will provide the interfaces among the countermeasures, controller, sensors and other APS components. Consider the overall time budget to defeat every threat. Provide the analysis behind each design approach in-regards to the selection of each protocol.  <br>    <br>  -- The MAF will provide the capabilities to exchange data with the host vehicle protocols and the MAF e.g. CAN, 1553, serial buses etc. in additions to the required interface and control with the crew station.  <br>    <br>  -- Total time required to detect, identify, classify, process and defeat threats.  A breakdown of time allocations consumed by each element of the MAPS is recommended. Interested parties shall justify their proposed time allocations, i.e. measured, tested, Modeling and Simulation, analysis, calculated, etc.  <br>    <br>  -- The MAF will support multiple enclaves for data processing, storage and exchange according to their classification and comply with the DoD regulations.  <br>    <br> RESPONSES:  <br>    <br> MAF RFI Responses must be post marked by February 28, 2014.  <br>    <br> Please address any questions regarding this market survey via email to: scott.m.rogan.civ@mail.mil and nathan.s.fountain.civ@mail.mil; include name, phone number and email address for a response.

The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as  quote mark confidential quote mark  under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term  quote mark confidential quote mark  in the context of Classified Information, quote mark  we will use the term  quote mark PROPRIETARY. quote mark  Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:  <br>    <br>  1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps)  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.  <br>    <br>  2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response).  The respondent's marking of data as  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore preclude disclosure to support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.  The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available. Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.    <br>    <br>  3. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT OBLIGATED TO PROTECT UNMARKED DATA.

<DESC>Sources sought for a commercial, performance-based services acquisition, which may result in a solicitation for a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract with two, one-year option periods. The expected period of performance is 1 September 2014 through 31 August 2015. The purpose of this synopsis is to gather interest, capabilities, and past performance (i.e., relevant and recent) of small business capable of supporting M3 requirements for the AMRG, an FOA of the ASA(M&RA), Alexandria, VA 22332.  <br>    <br>  Each contract period may include the following functional tasks:  current and forecasted core markets profile; current and forecasted US Army market penetration with core markets and influencers; current and forecasted gaps in media coverage; resource allocation review and analysis to maximize coverage; and sensitivity analysis of resource allocations to budget reductions (i.e., 10%, 20%, 30%, etc.).  <br>    <br>  BACKGROUND:  AMRG generates interest in Army service options through targeted marketing campaigns in order to motivate well-qualified candidates to join the Army. The AMRG's primary responsibility is to support the ASA(M&RA) through national marketing, marketing analysis, and accessions analysis.  It employs enterprise marketing strategies and processes via the Enterprise Army Brand (EAB) in support of the Active Army and US Army Reserve (USAR) recruiting activities for officers, enlisted, and Department of the Army Civilians (DACs).   <br>  Other AMRG responsibilities include:  informs the ASA(M&RA) on strategic issues and directions; provides policy, programming and supervision of the Army's marketing and advertising strategy and programs; establishes, maintains and monitors performance evaluation of the ASA(M&RA); management and performance evaluation of the Army's advertising contract; ensures policies, and programs within the Human Capital (HC) arena are consistent with statutes and the Secretary of the Army's objectives; and operational control of the US Army Accessions Support Brigade (USAASB) and its subordinate units.  <br>     <br>  The EAB connects America with the Army and promotes the positive value of Army service. It represents the reputation and ideals of the United States Army, and educates and promotes the positive value of Army service options to service-age citizens and their influencers. The EAB unifies key message elements of each of the Army service options: Enlisted, Officer, Special Missions, and Civilian sub-brands.   Key messaging goals of the Army Brand are to:  showcase the Army as a unique American institution that is representative of the country it serves during periods of peace and war; highlight the multiple paths of service available within the United States Army and distinguish from other services; promote the training, educational, financial, and career benefits offered by the Army in order to attract the most qualified candidates to Army service opportunities; educate influencers about the positive impacts and opportunities offered to America's youth by today's modern, technological Army; provide a focal point for marketing, advertising, and trade marking activities to reinforce positive associations with prestige, protection of the nation, technology and opportunity; influence qualified professionals to explore service opportunities offered by the Judge Advocate General's Corps, Army Medical Department, and Chaplain Corps by highlighting opportunities for valuable training and rewarding careers; and promote Reserve and DAC opportunities in order to retain highly qualified personnel who are transitioning from Active Duty service.  <br>    <br>  OBJECTIVES: The Army Brand and Marketing Program supports the Army Brand by delivering consistent messaging through national level advertising, marketing events, partnerships with external organizations, trademarking, and other internal and external communications. The objectives of the Army Brand and Marketing program are to:  increase the propensity for Army service; improve the Army's image so that it is the top service choice; strengthen partnerships between the Army and American educators; attract top prospects in support of accessions and hiring goals; and develop institutional processes that support targeted marketing campaigns.   <br>    <br>  CONTRACTOR MANPOWER REPORTING:  Required.  <br>  CITIZENSHIP:  US Citizenship required.  <br>  GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED EQUIPMENT/PROPERTY (GFE/GFP) PROVIDED:  YES  <br>  CONTRACTOR-FURNISHED EQUIPMENT/PROPERTY (CFE/CFP) TO BE PROVIDED:  YES  <br>  DOL'S THE SERVICE CONTRACT ACT:  APPLICABLE.  <br>    <br>  Supporting documentation must not exceed a total of 10 pages and be in the following formats: MS WORD, MS EXCEL, and/or .pdf documents.

<DESC><p>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to utilize other than full and open competition to contract with Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training (Lockheed Martin MST) in Moorestown, New Jersey, for the procurement and cabinet level testing of fiscal years 2014-2017 Aegis Weapon System (AWS) Modernization (AMOD) requirements for the Aegis Fleet, including Multi-Mission Signal Processors (MMSPs), Ballistic Missile Defense Baseline (BMD) 4.0.2 equipment suites, Baseline 5.0 Warhead Data Recording Cabinets (WDRCs), and TI 12/TI 16 Aegis AMOD Upgrade (AAU) equipment. Specifically, NAVSEA will procure production, test, and delivery of one (1) MMSP, one (1) WDRC, two (2) TI 12 AAU equipment sets in FY 14 to support DDG 79 and CG 62 and one (1) MMSP, one (1) WDRC, and one (1) TI 12 AAU equipment set in FY 15 to support DDG 80. Procurement of AMOD equipment for DDGs 81 and 83 are planned for FY 16 with additional procurements earmarked for DDGs 84 and 85 in FY 17. These latter procurements may target TI 16 equipment upgrades depending on design maturity. Please note that the specific DDG hulls specified above may vary as ship schedules and availabilities change. The contract for FY 14-15 requirements will be awarded in or around the fourth quarter of 2014. FY 16-17 requirements will be procured under a future, separate contract action. <br /><br />Due to the complexity of the AWS, a contractor must have intimate knowledge of all system requirements, weapon specifications, equipment design and interfaces, in order to produce, field and test production units. Lockheed Martin MST is the prime contractor for MMSP and BMD 4.0.2 development efforts, as well as the prime contractor for AWS production. Accordingly, the AMOD requirements described in this notice will be procured from Lockheed Martin MST on a sole source basis under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(1). Lockheed Martin MST is the only known source possessing the requisite knowledge and ability to meet the Navy's technical requirements within the schedule for implementing AMOD capability. This announcement is published for information purposes only. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Lockheed Martin directly.</p>
<p>Notice: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>This acquisition is a follow on effort to the SOF RAPTOR and SOF RAPTOR II contracts originally awarded by the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) in 2001 and 2009 respectively.  The original SOF RAPTOR contract provided a vehicle for conducting training requirements analysis, concept exploration, and prototyping to support United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and its component commands' simulator and simulation requirements.   <br>  <br> The efforts contracted under SOF RAPTOR II included similar types of tasks to those performed under the original SOF RAPTOR contract, but also supported numerous Live, Virtual, and Constructive efforts to meet the training and rehearsal objectives of USSOCOM and its component commands.   <br> The new SOF RAPTOR III contract will support not only the objectives of USSOCOM programs, but to support the objectives of the joint Special Operations Forces (SOF) community to conduct operations.  More specifically, this contract vehicle provides the means for conducting training requirements analysis, advanced concept exploration, rapid prototype development, curriculum development, SOF specific training and rehearsal exercises, as well as providing support for operation and maintenance functions in support of SOF training requirements.   <br>
