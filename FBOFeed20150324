This a Government Market Research effort in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part Ten (10) and Far Part Fifteen (15) "Contracting by Negotiation". This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to a formal release of an RFP (if any is issued). <br /><br />This action falls under NAICS code 511330 with a size standard of $38.5M. Under this NAICS code, please specify if you are a Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Small Business, Section 8a Small Business, Woman-owned Small Business and Service Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business or HubZone Small Business. Please indicate all that apply.
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to determine industry availability of Contractor facility to perform Modeling, Simulation and Integration (MS&amp;I) work at a multi-level classified environment. The facility must be capable of performing medium to high fidelity virtual real-time simulations, with both manned and digital simulations, across multiple scenario environments supporting Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) objectives. MS&amp;I activities will be directed by the Government sponsor. The simulation capabilities at the contractor facility must address components of the Department of Defense's (DoD) current and future kill-chain architectures for IAMD. <br /><br />The Contractor shall plan, implement, execute and maintain a multi-service security environment to support the classified MS&amp;I development and demonstration activity.A. Program Security: The Prime Contractor shall establish, implement and maintain program security in accordance with a contract DD254 and subsequent delivery order DD254(s). This shall include the management of personnel, documentation, Automated Information Systems (AIS), facility controls, and all subcontractors. The Contractor shall also provide security technical documentation to ensure contract compliance. The Contractor shall flow down these security requirements to the appropriate subcontractors through established relationships.<br /><br />B. Technical Support: The Contractor shall provide expertise and support to develop integrate maintain, demonstrate and analyze the performance of kill-chain weapon systems within the contractor facility, both for existing and future system capabilities. Individual weapon system models may be Government-provided through associate relationships with development contractors. Government-provided models will be Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) compliant. The Contactor shall provide the simulation environment and the network architecture to support real-time, virtual exercise events that accommodates DIS compliant models. The simulation environment shall include selected unmanned and manned system models (both hardware and software components) in addition to providing the operating environment for the manned systems. The simulation environment may support distributed, multi-level operations with other virtual facilities.<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide a simulation environment that supports multi-level secure operation to allow systems to function at its unique security levels while maintaining the integrity of system-specific information. The simulation environment should be capable of, and approved for, distributed operations with other virtual facilities which may be at their own unique security levels. <br />The contactor shall have primary responsibility for implementation of Government-provided scenarios (both blue and red force) based on event requirements. The Contractor shall also provide the capability to collect, store and distribute data for each demonstration, integration and test event, and provide that data to the Government sponsor. Data collected will be from the Government sponsored test event and used for stakeholder decisions.<br /><br />C. Integration and Test Events: The Contractor shall support technical integration meetings as well as simulation integration and test events as designated by the Government. The Contractor shall incorporate, update and manage the schedule for Government activities, and shall coordinate with the government concerning schedule conflicts or facility issues. For planning purposes, the Contractor should be prepared to support 4-6 simulation events annually. Each event is typically one week and is normally preceded by 2-3 dedicated integration test weeks spaced over a 1-2 month timeframe. The facility and environment should be prepared to support 50-60 manned entities, 500-1000 non-manned entities, and Government-provided threat data or models. The threat environment must support air-breathing, missile, and surface and ground-based air defenses.<br /><br />D.&nbsp; Facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;See MS_I2014 RFI Facilities description attachment.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br />SECTION&nbsp;II:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>QUESTIONS FOR POTENTIAL RESPONDERS</strong>:</span><br /><br />1.

<DESC>NSN: Not Applicable. P/N: Not Applicable.
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to provide continuing engineering and technical data services required to determine the stress and load characteristics and/or loading environment of specified areas of the AC-130W; provide engineering and data services to define the usage and operational environment of Special Operations Forces (SOF) C-130's; and provide support for the SOF Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall identify AC-130W unique integration components for the Loads Environmental Spectra Survey (L/ESS) system, including data acquisition unit programming, MIL-STD-1553 Bus Protocol Specification, data bus connections, and mounting of components and report the findings and updates. In addition, the contractor will provide updated source data based on lessons learned from a similar tasking performed previously on AC-130 aircraft. Incorporate any red lines from the previous installation along with the unique L/ESS configurations into new drawings created by this task for the AC-130W aircraft.</p>
<p><br />DELIVERY SCHEDULE: ESTIMATED twelve (12) month Period of Performance (PoP). Intended Source: The Corporation of Mercer University, d.b.a. Mercer Engineering Research Center (MERC), 135 Osigian Blvd, Warner Robins, GA 31088. CAGE CODE: 1WDH9.</p>
<p>MERC is the only source known that can satisfy the needs of the agency. Authority: <br />10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A), the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>However, all proposals received within thirty (30) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 5.206, Notice of Subcontracting Opportunities, the information regarding this effort is posted in this synopsis. Interested sources should contact Mercer Engineering Research Center for subcontracting possibilities. Any other questions should be directed to the buyer/PCO identified below. If your concerns are not satisfied by the Contracting Officer, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact the Ombudsman, Kim McDonald, at 478-222-1088.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency. Solicitation will be uploaded to Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) .

<p>Several documents related to this solicitation will be posted as "secured" in the FedBizOpps website. Please find below instructions to access secured documents in FedBizOpps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instructions for access to the FBO Secure Site:&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") system, offerors must:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Please note that SAM has replaced the previous system Central Contractor Registration (CCR). If an entity was previously registered in CRR the information should have transferred into SAM. You just need to set up a SAM account and migrate your CCR roles.</p>
<p>2. Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at www.fbo.gov <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/">https://www.fbo.gov/</a>and log in. Verify your registration within the FBO system. The FBO Vendor Guide is available at https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf &lt;https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf&gt; to provide assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Once your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, click on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD2345 - Military Critical Technical Data Agreement Form. You can also find the DD2345 at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf &lt;http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf&gt;- . Fill out the DD2345 form and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form. JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date within five days of receipt. Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect. Additionally, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Once you receive the approved DD2345 form from JCP and have verified your status on the JCP website, <a href="http://www.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/jcp/search.aspx">http://www.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/jcp/search.aspx</a>, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link. The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN. The MPIN number is a mandatory data element created by the CCR registrant and must have nine characters: at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number. No spaces or special characters are permitted. It allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also serves as a validation to access sensitive but unclassified documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors will submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button. Once vendors request explicit access, the FBO system will send notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, who will approve the request in the system. Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system, and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address:<br /></strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E144, Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES
<p><strong>Description:<br /></strong>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB), plans to procure on a sole source basis the services for chromosome breakage analyses testing from the Oregon Health &amp; Science University, OHSU Patient Business Services, P.O. Box 3595, Portland, OR 97201.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 621511 and the business size standard is $32.5M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance of the IDIQ contract is sixty (60) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) is a research program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Division is the world's most comprehensive cancer epidemiology research group. Its renowned epidemiologists, geneticists, and biostatisticians conduct population and multidisciplinary research to discover the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention. The Division's research impacts public health policy in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>The Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is engaged in an ongoing clinical genetics study of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. Fanconi anemia is the prototype disease, and families with this syndrome comprise the majority of patients seen on this particular study. CGB has a need to obtain the results of the Fanconi anemia chromosome breakage test in order to appropriately classify family members as affected or unaffected by this disease. The samples will be derived from individuals who are members of families in which there is a clinical basis to suspect the diagnosis of Fanconi anemia. There will also be samples from individuals with other types of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, in order to document that Fanconi anemia has been ruled out. This particular study is part of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, intramural research program within DCEG's Human Genetics Program which is focused upon elucidation of the entire spectrum of scientific and clinical issues related to familial and hereditary forms of cancer. This is an ongoing study, and this submission is a continuation of that work and not new work. This study is an integral part of the NCI protocol 02-C-0052.</p>
<p><strong>Contractor shall perform the following tasks:<br /></strong>&bull; The Contractor will receive samples of heparinized peripheral blood, or lymphoblastoid or fibroblast cell lines, or freshly obtained skin biopsies, with coded identification numbers, from CGB investigators for chromosome breakage analysis, or with identifiers from some patients. If the Contractor is blinded to identifying information pertaining to the individuals from whom these specimens were derived, the Contractor will be prohibited from seeking such information. Therefore, from the Contractor's perspective, those samples shall be anonymous. A maximum of eighty-five (85) samples anticipated annually.<br />&bull; The Contractor must be a CLIA-certified laboratory, so that the results can be conveyed to the patient for use in clinical management.<br />&bull; The specimens will consist of peripheral blood, or lymphoblastoid cell lines, or skin fibroblasts. For the latter, a fresh skin biopsy may be provided which the Contractor will need to culture followed by chromosome breakage analysis. Alternatively, CGB may submit previously cultured skin fibroblast cells for direct analysis.<br />&bull; The cells derived from these samples shall be exposed to diepoxybutane (DEB) and mitomycin-C (MMC) [Cervenka et al, Am J Med Genet 15:211-223, 1983] in the laboratory, using standard testing protocols, to determine whether the cells are more sensitive than normal cells to the chromosome-damaging effects of these DNA cross-linking agents.<br />&bull; The Contractor shall provide a written report which includes the number of cells with X number of chromosome breaks (X = 0 to X = &gt;8) as breaks per metaphase cell, and the number of cells with radial forms ranging from 0 to 8 radials per metaphase. The report should also indicate the % of cells with any break, and % of cells with any radial. This information shall be reported for each patient specimen, and for the control samples that are run.<br />&bull; Include a milestone or performance schedule. The written report for blood samples shall be returned to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) within twenty-one (21) business days from specimen receipt, except in the case of unusual problems requiring additional investigation. These exceptions must be negotiated directly via telephone discussion with the COR. If the specimen is a fresh skin biopsy, which requires culture prior to breakage analysis, then the time for results to be released needs to be discussed on a case-by-case basis.<br />&bull; Progress Meetings. In lieu of meetings, the Contractor will provide an updated cumulative excel file at 6 month intervals, containing the data discussed above under requirements, for all samples received prior to that date. The dates will be January and July, for the preceding six (6) months to be added to the file.</p>
<p>This laboratory testing service is provided by the Oregon Health and Science University, Knight Cancer Institute, Knight Diagnostic Laboratories. The proposed source is the only known laboratory that can perform all the studies required in the SOW. OHSU uses two different clastogenic chemicals, at various concentrations, and report the level of details that CGB requires for this project. There have been no errors in CGB's prior work over the past 14 years of the on-going study. They are uniquely experienced in both blood and fibroblast analyses, which is required. CGB has used their data for peer-reviewed publications, and to properly classify patients and distinguish those with Fanconi anemia from their healthy relatives and from patients with other disorders. The assay is both sensitive and specific, and is critical for proper classification of CGB's patients, and is imperative for the integrity and continuity of the on-going study.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 12:00PM EDT, on April 8, 2015. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed (240) 276-5401 or emailed to Catherine Muir, Contracting Officer via electronic mail at muirca@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, Contractors must be registered and have valid, current Entity Record, including current Representations and Certifications, in the System for Award Management (SAM) through SAM.gov.

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency seeking fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. The NHGRI Medical Genetic Branch (MGB) seeks to identify and understand inherited disorders of metabolism and of human development. MGB investigators focus on human genetics, vertebrate embryology, inborn errors of metabolism, and neurogenetic disorders. Projects performed at the biochemical, molecular, and cell biological levels involve the direct study of human subjects as well as the development and use of experimental model systems, such as zebrafish and mouse. The Branch fosters outstanding basic research and serves as a model for translational research, emphasizing the compassionate and scientifically rigorous application of basic science discoveries at the bedside. MGB uses both Microscopes throughout the institute and there is an important need to ensure this equipment is operational at all times. The Zeiss confocal microscope is used extensively in the cell biology studies. It allows researchers to image both living and fixed cells and make images and movies of cells stained with fluorescent stains or fluorescent antibodies. Also, cell biology is used for proof of principle on many of the genetic diseases being studied. Additionally the confocal microscope is being used to rule out certain disorders.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons<br />Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA<br />intends to award a firm fixed price (FFP) contract to procure 80 Flight Termination Receivers (FTR) to Kratos-Lancaster, 3061 Industry Dr., Lancaster, PA 17603, manufacturer part number 570006. The delivery schedule is 12 months after receipt of order. The FTR is a critical subcomponent of a Flight Termination System (FTS). The FTS used by Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) freeflight testing activities has been certified for use in accordance with Range Commander Council (RCC)-319, Flight Termination Systems Commonality Standard. As the use of RCC member range(s) is necessary for the execution of required JSOW flight test(s), the JSOW FTS must meet RCC-319. Due to the strict safety requirements of RCC-319, only the above mentioned part meets agency needs. The FTS subcomponents are unique to the manufacturer and were specifically designed for the JSOW Program's FTS, thus no drop-in-replacement second source exists. Any substitution of a new subcomponent automatically invalidates the Safety certification for both the replaced subcomponent and the FTS. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses and questions may be submitted to NAWCWD Contract Specialist Melinda Childs by email (preferred): melinda.childs@navy.mil, fax to (760) 939-3095, or mail to Commander Code 220000D, NAWCWD, 429 E.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division intends to award a sole source purchase order to the Raytheon Company, 1847 West Main Road, Portsmouth, RI 02871-1087 for a continuation of basic research for the development of unique mathematical and statistical algorithms. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) has requested that the Raytheon CAD/CAC algorithms be adapted to a variety of systems and to demonstrate this capability over the next several years. This specific effort will involve the extension of these algorithms to another sensor system for the Naval Facilities Command. Only Raytheon has the unique knowledge base, the facilities, and the experienced personnel necessary to successfully conduct the work. The key personnel have invested over nine years in gaining the unique knowledge, insight, and skills necessary. Additionally, the algorithms developed by Raytheon represent many work years under other Raytheon/DOD contracts and Raytheon's own independent research and development (IRAD). The algorithms are very sophisticated and require specialized knowledge to use properly thus another vendor cannot easily or cost-effectively duplicate them. Results will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.&nbsp; NAICS Code: 541511&nbsp; FSC Code R425&nbsp; SBA Size Standard: $27.5M&nbsp; Award will be based on a fair and reasonable price. Award will be made on or about April 8, 2015.&nbsp; Point of Contact: <a href="mailto:sharon.hess@navy.mil">sharon.hess@navy.mil</a></p>

Navy Information Dominance Forces (NAVIDFOR) is a readiness Type Commander (TYCOM) with the global responsibility of identifying, and submitting requirements for all Navy Information Dominance capabilities. The NAVIDFOR Shore Modernization and Integration Directorate (NAVIDFOR N46) was established to consolidate Man, Train  and  Equip-focused activities in support of Navy enterprise network integration; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Collaboration, and Intelligence (C5I) shore modernization; Fleet strategic communications; and cyber security/portfolio management responsibilities for the domain.
  NAVIDFOR N46 is the TYCOM lead for planning and executing information environment integration, consolidation, readiness reporting, and modernization efforts in support of Naval Networking Environment (NNE), Joint Information Environment (JIE), and Unified Capabilities (UC) initiatives. 

The NNE strategy was established to guide the Department of Navy (DON) towards a future net-centric enterprise environment that will provide a highly secure and reliable enterprise-wide voice, video, and data network environment.  The NNE will include the Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN), Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES), Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN), and OCONUS Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-NET).
 Transition to the NNE is critical to enabling the Navys cyber operations mission and providing warfighters with seamless connectivity and information sharing capabilities on a global, regional, and local scale.  Additionally, achieving the target state NNE will serve as a key enabler to realizing the JIE.  

JIE is a framework defining the capabilities required to provide a secure information environment across the Department of Defense (DOD).  JIE will be comprised of a shared information technology (IT) infrastructure, enterprise services, and a single security architecture in order to achieve full spectrum superiority, improve mission effectiveness, increase security and realize IT efficiencies.

<DESC>Pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the Contracting Officer may solicit from one source if the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source is reasonably available. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS), on behalf of PSC, intends to sole source to:
<p>The Conference Board<br />845 Third Avenue<br />New York, NY 10022</p>
<p>PSC seeks to obtain one 12-month base period and two 12-month option periods of membership with The Conference Board, as well as one seat on The Conference Board Council. The Conference Board is a global, independent business membership and research association to help PSC deal with its most critical issues as a shared services entity. Specifically, PSC seeks The Conference Board's expertise in four main subject areas: Corporate Leadership; Economies, Markets and Value Creation; High-Performing Organizations; and Human Capital. Membership with The Conference Board will give PSC a unique perspective to respond to its internal challenges, as well as the challenges faced by PSC's customers. Membership to The Conference Board provides a number of unique benefits, including unlimited access to research and analysis; unlimited access to live and on-demand webcasts; unlimited access to business information service (which allows members to ask direct questions); and a subscription to periodicals. Each of these benefits reflects The Conference Board's expertise in the four subject areas listed above.</p>
<p>The Conference Board is uniquely qualified to provide PSC with these desired services not only because of its expertise in PSC's desired subject areas, but also because The Conference Board offers a seat on The Conference Board Council. The Council is a confidential, cross-industry professional community that gives PSC leadership the opportunity to learn from other organizations' leadership experiences and insights, as well as the ability to collaboratively explore solutions to pressing business challenges.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive proposal. No solicitation document is available. All responsible sources that have determined that they can provide the same services may submit product information and a capabilities statement that speaks to the services PSC is seeking in this proposed acquisition. The email subject line must reference PSC150956. All responses are due by March 30, 2015, 12:00 PM Eastern Time and can be sent to Khristine Agnello at Khristine.Agnello@psc.hhs.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract base upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>Overview of the Requirement and the Purpose of the Notice
The purpose of this Notice is to identify the availability of capable small business concerns (e.g., 8(a), veteran owned, service-disabled veteran owned, Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone), small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and economically disadvantaged woman owned) and other than Small Business that can perform: (1) agricultural market analysis, (2) agricultural marketing strategy and planning, (3) design and content development to support scaling of new agricultural technologies, and (4) marketing campaign development and execution to reach indirect beneficiaries of agricultural technologies in Feed the Future countries. USAID seeks to obtain industry questions and/or comments for this planned new activity, Feed the Future (FTF) Marketing to Scale. USAID intends to award a single contract for this new activity.  Given the nature of this award, the leadership of this project must foster a productive working relationship with multiple stakeholders, USAID Missions and Washington offices, International Agriculture Research Centers, Innovation Labs, Implementing Partners, FtF-supported Micro-, Small- and Medium sized Enterprises (MSMEs), notably seed companies.  The attached Concept Note presents the current draft objectives and key elements of the activity. The level of funding allocated for this project is expected to range between $16 million and $24 million over a five-year implementation period.
This is not an invitation for bid, request for proposal or other solicitation; and in no way obligates the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to award a contract.

<a href="mailto:lam.v.pham@nasa.gov">Lam V. Pham</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/ARC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for NASGRO Phase 2 FAD Development.  <p> 1.	Background NASAs Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA) and Ames Research Centers Pressure Systems Manager require the ability to evaluate the fitness for service and remaining safe life of ground based pressure vessels and pressurized systems (including non-code layered vessels) that experience cyclic pressure and thermal loadings with induced fatigue damage and crack growth using the NASGRO fracture mechanics analysis software. NASGRO was initially developed in the 1980s by Lockheed Martin Services under contract to NASA to address space flight program fracture control requirements, but the features required for current assessment of ground based pressure systems were generally not included in that development.  In 2000, a Space Act Agreement (SAA) was signed with Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) for the collaborative development and commercialization NASGRO to ensure its ongoing support through the establishment of a consortium of industry users with SwRI serving as the managing partner and principal developer.  At the same time, the NASGRO copyright was assigned and transferred to SwRI, who retains it to the present.	 Under the terms of the SAA, NASA retains a perpetual royalty-free license for use of NASGRO for NASA programs and projects.	NASA is not a consortium member, however, and any NASA-specific development tasks must be funded by the Agency.  NASA JSC continues funding the development of space flight related fracture control tasks, and NASA OSMA began incremental funding of tasks related to fitness for service assessment of ground based pressure vessels in 2014 (Phase 1 of this effort). The items requested herein are Phase 2 development tasks, and it is anticipated that additional phases will be undertaken in the future as funds become available.  <p> NASAs policy as expressed in NPD 8710.5D and pressure system safety requirements of NASA STD-8719.17A require that each NASA Center demonstrate the safety, fitness for service, and remaining safe life of potentially hazardous ground based pressure vessels and systems.  NASA has many such systems that are both vital to NASAs mission as well as presenting significant potential hazard to the staff and facilities.  Most are subjected cyclic fatigue loadings, and many were fabricated from undocumented, non-Code materials and processes.	Standard ASME Code rule-based techniques are often inadequate for addressing the in-service conditions and features of these vessels without excessive conservatisms, and the specialized capabilities of fracture mechanics and cyclic crack growth is needed to provide meaningful remaining safe life assessments given significant defects due to original welding processes or induced through operational loadings.  In addition, the applicable industry Codes and Standards that are mandated by OSHA (e.g., ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code, API-579 Fitness for Service Standard) all now require the application of the failure assessment diagram (FAD) approach and its underlying analytical methodologies.  NASGRO has lagged behind in incorporation of this approach principally because the consortium members and JSC interests are aerospace rather than ground based.  Thus, NASGRO requires directed engineering directed development to fully incorporate FAD features and techniques and apply it to all needed stress intensity factor models in order to fully facilitate NASGROs application to institutional systems. A master list of FAD development tasks was agreed upon in NASA in 2013, and these phases of work incrementally address the major topics identified in that list.  Collectively they are identified as NASGRO FAD development tasks. <p> This document is the Phase 2 statement of work for NASGRO FAD development.  There are four specific subtasks tasks identified from the master list, each of which requires fracture mechanics engineering support, software coding, verification and validation testing, reporting, and project management.  <p> 2.	Objective As specified in Section 3 below, the vendor shall perform Phase 2 engineering and software development tasks as a follow-on to previously completed Phase 1 work to incorporate and enhance NASGROs FAD capabilities as related to assessment of NASAs institutional ground based pressure vessels and systems.  This work requires completing development tasks, documenting that completion through issuance of Demonstrated Functionality Reports (DFRs), and including the software updates in the next alpha release of NASGRO for user community assessment.  One task requires developing a software design document for future implementation of ASME FFS-1 / API 579 Level 3 FAD options on all relevant NASGRO crack models. <p> 3.	Scope & Specifications Perform Phase 2 NASGRO FAD development by completing the tasks listed below.  All software development work for these tasks shall comply with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, subpart B, sections 1194.21 (Software Applications and Operating Systems) for code included in formal releases of NASGRO. <p> a.Task 2(b)  Proper handling of secondary stresses (remaining NASFLA GUI tasks). Provide a Demonstrated Functionality Report (DFR) as the completion milestone and include the updated programming in the next NASGRO alpha release, v. 8.1. b.Task 2(c)  Proper handling of secondary stresses (FAD crack case transitions for post transition geometry).  Provide a Demonstrated Functionality Report (DFR) as the completion milestone and include the updated programming in the next NASGRO alpha release, v. 8.1. c.Task 3(a)  Develop the ASME FFS-1 / API-579 Level 3 FAD approach as a parallel option to the existing NASGRO FITNET FAD capability and issue the software design document as the completion milestone. Task 4(b)  Implement FAD capabilities for existing NASGRO pressure vessel stress intensify factor models that have limit load solutions already available (TC07, TC08, SC06 and TC06).  Provide a Demonstrated Functionality Report (DFR) as the completion milestone and include the updated programming in the next NASGRO alpha release, v. 8.1. <p> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center (ARC) is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for this procurement. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto. <p> No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. <p> Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. <p> Responses must include the following: name, address, and website address of firm, size of business; number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, or any category of small business listed above, number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers for similar systems during the past three years (include contract numbers, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - email and phone number). <p> Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product. A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. <p> This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. <p> Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. <p> All responses shall be submitted to Mr. Lam Pham (<a href="mailto:lam.v.pham@nasa.gov">lam.v.pham@nasa.gov </a> ) no later than Tuesday, 03/31/2015.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS: <br>  <br> The purpose of this Request For Information (RFI) is to conduct Market Research for the advanced development, procurement, fielding, and sustainment of medical treatment, prophylactic, and diagnostic capabilities against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) warfare agents.  <br>  <br> Respondents are invited to provide materials related to their capabilities to fulfill ALL or ANY of the requirements listed below. Respondents should provide whether their level of interest and current capability is to fulfill the entire scope of the effort, or a limited aspect of the effort, such as teaming as a subcontractor with another firm. If candidates are interested in teaming with other sources, please include in your response authorization to release your company's name, area of interest, and POC information to be made available on a public website. All proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary. Do not use Government Security classification markings.  <br>  <br> This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This is not a solicitation or request for competitive proposals. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. The Government will not reimburse respondents for preparation of the response. <br>  <br> BACKGROUND: <br>  <br> The Joint Project Management Office Medical Countermeasure Systems (JPM-MCS), under the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD), is the DOD organization responsible for the advanced development, procurement, fielding, and sustainment of medical treatment, prophylactic, and diagnostic capabilities against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) warfare agents. <br>  <br> Information gathered in response to this RFI will be used to support the Joint Product Director for Diagnostics (JPdM Dx) in strategic planning for development of the Next Generation Diagnostics System Increment 2 (NGDS Inc 2) acquisition strategy.  Specifically, information gathered will be reviewed as part of a market survey in support of the NGDS Inc 2 Request For Proposals (RFP) expected to be released by late summer/early Fall 2015. <br>   <br> OBJECTIVES: <br>  <br> JPM-MCS is interested in collecting information from companies who are currently in the U.S. domestic healthcare market or are considering a future entry into the market for FDA-cleared diagnostics for human diseases caused by exposure to biological, chemical, toxin, and radiological threat agents. JPM-MCS is interested in collecting information about diagnostics systems that are complementary to, and to be used in conjunction with, the NGDS Inc 1 sample-to-answer molecular (PCR) diagnostic platform (Biofire FilmArray) used in forward-deployed clinical laboratories (i.e. combat support hospitals and ships).  The NGDS Inc 2 program is seeking information on affinity-based diagnostics systems or other alternatives to PCR-based diagnostics systems.  A biomarker-based diagnostics approach is desirable where direct antigen detection is not feasible due to low concentrations of circulating threat agents in relevant clinical samples such as whole blood or sputum.  The NGDS Inc 2 program is interested in assay designs focusing on detection of host-response biomarkers, including serological assays, as indication of CBRN exposure.  However, novel application of PCR-based technologies for CBRN diagnostics will be considered if not redundant to the NGDS Inc 1 system.  Patients may be tested pre-symptomatically or within 12 to 120 hours of exhibiting symptoms, depending on the location of the clinic/laboratory.   <br>  <br> CBRN threats that are of specific interest to the NGDS Inc 2 program include: <br> * Intracellular bacterial pathogens: Brucella spp., Rickettsia spp., Coxiella burnetii <br> * Burkholderia spp. <br> * Biological toxins: Botulinum toxin, Ricin, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) <br> * Viruses: Alphavirus spp. <br> * Chemical Warfare agents: Nerve agents, blood agents, choking agents <br> * Radiological exposures <br>  <br> Applications for these technologies and systems include: <br> * Use at small clinical laboratories providing centralized support to fixed site and mobile hospitals less than 200 beds <br> * Point of Care diagnostics in a CLIA-waived setting <br> * HIPAA-Compliant communications and data processing tools supporting remote data analysis/interpretation of point of care sample analyses (if applicable) <br> * Non-invasive or very low invasive population screening tools to identify people who may benefit from follow-on diagnostic testing <br>  <br> Desired characteristics, as applicable to threat agent and/or application <br> [T] Threshold, [O] Objective <br>  <br> * Detection of disease specific host biomarkers (describe the technical maturity and regulatory framework for associated biomarkers) <br> * Detection of agent specific proteins and biomolecules  <br> * Supportive of syndrome based diagnostics with endemic diseases with the same patient inclusion criteria, if applicable [O] <br> * Sensitivity relevant to the disease state/application  <br> * Highly specific Portable, total system weight (0.5 lbs. [O], 15 lbs. [T]) <br> * Existing or emerging FDA regulatory framework to support development and 510k clearance/ PMA approval  <br> * FDA cleared for in-vitro diagnostics [O] or sufficiently mature to begin U.S. FDA Clinical Trials no later than January 2017 [T]Safe for use with BSL 4 agents (low risk of aerosolizing sample materials) [T] <br> * Single Sample Time to Result (5 minutes [O], 30 minutes [T]).  If greater than 30 minutes, please explain why this is the state of the art for the threat/application  <br> * Complexity (CLIA-waived [O], Moderate [T]), if highly complex please explain why this is the state of the art for the threat/application  <br> * Single use consumable or reusable, adaptable instrument/assay based system  <br> * Open Architecture (supporting 3rd party assay design and development, non-proprietary file formats) [O] <br> * Electronically enabled for data archiving and communications (or explain how the data may be captured permanently) <br>  <br> SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: <br>  <br> All written responses must be received within Fifteen (15) Calendar Days of issuance of this RFI.  Submissions should:  <br> (1) Use Microsoft Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF);  <br> (2) Be sent to the POCs identified below (email is preferred);  <br> (3) Be complete, sufficiently detailed, and organized in a manner that tracks to the information requested in this RFI;  <br> (4) Include a single company point of contact with name, title, address, telephone  numbers, and e-mail address (es); and  <br> (5) Not exceed 15 single-sided pages in total (not including cover page and cover letter). Other media types (i.e., CD, printed technical information) that meet the submission criteria above will be accepted. Material that is advertisement only in nature is not desired.  <br>  <br> Please address responses to this notice to: <br> Contracting Officer, Ms. Jessica Ely: Jessica.l.ely.civ@mail.mil   <br> Contract Specialist, Jennifer Bassett: jennifer.s.bassett.civ@mail.mil   <br>  <br> Please designate a company point of contact (telephone, address, and email).

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This is a Government Market Research effort in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part Ten (10)  quote mark Market Research quote mark  and FAR Part Fifteen (15)  quote mark Contracting by Negotiation quote mark . This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. All information submitted in response to this RFI is voluntary. The United States Government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice; will not pay for information requested; nor will it compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing, preparing, or submitting a response to this notice. Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to a formal release of a RFP, if any is issued. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI). It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this announcement.  <br>  <br> This RFI falls under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712 with a size standard of $40,000,000.00. Under this NAICS code, please specify if you are a Small Business; Small Disadvantaged Small Business; Section 8a Small Business; Woman-owned Small Business; Service Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business; or HubZone Small Business. Please indicate all that apply.  <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command-Redstone (ACC-RSA) is exploring options for contractor performance to provide engineering services relevant to the design, development, fabrication, factory acceptance testing, and delivery of a 120 kilowatt solid state laser source subsystem capable of integration with the US Army's High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator (HEL MD). Responses to this RFI will be incorporated with other market research. The Government will determine whether or not to proceed with an acquisition and, if it does decide to proceed, the best acquisition strategy that will meet the needs of the Government.  <br>  <br> As part of the RFI response, the Government would like to know the assessed Technology Readiness Level and laser performance results your company has demonstrated to date. Beam quality shall be presented in the power-in-the-bucket format assuming an angular bucket radius of 1.5*l/D where l is the laser emission wavelength and D is the laser source beam diameter at the exit aperture. Rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost and schedule estimates, and an initial list of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) are required. Address mechanical, electrical, optical, and thermal management design, fabrication, integration and testing capabilities required for solid state laser sources with an average output power level of 120 kW or greater. Explain your company's process for implementing the requirements of Army Regulation (AR) AR 380-49 (Industrial Security Program) as supplemented by the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), Department of Defense Manual (DoDM) 5220.22-M to support the classified laser development and demonstration activity.  <br>  <br> A. Initial Statement of Technical Objectives - The United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC)/Army Forces Strategic Command (ARSTRAT) Technical Center is considering a 120 kW high energy laser subsystem to be integrated into the High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator (HEL MD) in FY19. HEL MD is an Army Technology Demonstrator that can host various high power lasers for demonstration in a tactical environment. The goal of this effort is to have a laser completed by late Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 and ready for integration into HEL MD. The following are some of the major laser subsystem and interface requirements that must be met for integration with the HEL MD Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) A4 enclosure:  <br>  <br> - The Laser Subsystem (LSS) weight shall not exceed 1621 lbs.  <br> - The LSS volume shall be totally contained in a shrink wrapped volume of less than 48 ft3.  <br> - The LSS shall have an output laser power of not less than 120 kW.  <br> - The LSS shall have an electrical to optical efficiency of 34% or better.  <br> - The LSS shall require no more than 233 kW of heat removal during operation.  <br> - The LSS shall be able to support the system magazine of 200 seconds and 28% duty cycle. (For example, after a continuous 200 second lasing event, the LSS shall be fully recharged after 514 seconds.)  <br> - The LSS Power-in-the-Bucket (PIB) Figure of Merit: 77%. Of the total laser power shall be contained in a 1.5*l/D angular radius bucket.  <br> - The LSS wavelengths shall be within 1023-1075 nanometers (nm) with a beam diameter of no more than 27 +/- 3 millimeters (mm) at 1/e2 intensity.  <br> - The peak irradiance of the LSS output beam shall be less than 37.5 kilowatts per square centimeter (kW/cm2).  <br> - The LSS shall contain an Internal Alignment Laser (IAL) which has wavelength within 600-660 nm. The IAL shall align the LSS with the beam control optics before firing.  <br> - The LSS shall operate when the LSS is tilted up to 10% grade in any direction.  <br> - The LSS shall change states between firing at sub-second rates.  <br> - The LSS shall be provided power from the onboard generator, onboard batteries, or shore power.  <br> - The LSS shall interface with a refrigerant cooled (R134a) heat exchanger that is part of the HEL MD platform thermal management subsystem.  <br> - The LSS shall shut down within 20 milliseconds (ms) upon loss of any operationally critical or safety critical discrete control signal.  <br> - The optical beam jitter at the output aperture of the LSS shall have a root-mean-square 1 sigma value of less than or equal to 4 milliradians (mrad) at 10 Hertz (Hz) or below, transitioning to 4 microradians (urad) at 300 Hz and above.  <br> - All LSS safe, system safe, arm, and fire commands shall be via 24 volt direct current discrete control signals.  <br>  <br> B. Program Security: The Prime Contractor will be required to establish, implement and maintain program security in accordance with a contract DD254 and any subsequent delivery order DD254(s). This includes the management of personnel, documentation, Automated Information Systems (AIS), facility controls, and all subcontractors. The Prime Contractor shall also provide security technical documentation to ensure compliance with AR 380-49 and the NISPOM. The Prime Contractor shall flow down these security requirements to the appropriate subcontractors.  <br>  <br> C. Technical Support: The Prime Contractor shall provide expertise and materials to design, develop, fabricate, integrate, and test high power solid state laser source systems within the contractor facility. Individual component or subsystem software models may be Government-provided through associate relationships with development contractors. Government-provided models will be Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) compliant.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The ALS Registry Act (H.R. 2295) was passed on October 16, 2008. The ALS Registry Act amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of DHHS, acting through the Director of CDC/ATSDR, to (1) develop a system to collect data on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); and (2) establish a national registry for the collection and storage of ALS data.<br /><br />In October, 2010, ATSDR officially launched the National ALS Registry. The purpose of the ALS Registry is to better describe the incidence and prevalence of ALS in the United States; examine factors, such as environmental and occupational, that might be associated with the disease; better outline key demographic factors (such as age, race or ethnicity, gender, and family history of individuals who are diagnosed with the disease) associated with the disease; and facilitate examination of the connection between ALS and other motor neuron disorders that can be confused with ALS, misdiagnosed as ALS, and in some cases progress to ALS.</p>
<p>In July 2014, ATSDR released its first National ALS Registry report. During October 19, 2010-December 31, 2011, a total of 12,187 persons meeting the surveillance case definition of ALS were identified by the Registry, for a prevalence of 3.9 cases of ALS per 100,000 persons in the U.S. general population. In addition to tracking new ALS cases, ATSDR is now engaging in a series of activities to further enhance the National ALS Registry. Examples already underway include launching new survey modules to help identify potential risk factors for ALS and using comprehensive surveillance activities in select states and large metropolitan areas to help test the completeness of the Registry. <br /><br />Because little is known about the role genetics plays in ALS, ATSDR conducted a pilot study to determine the feasibility of establishing a biorepository of samples from persons with ALS. Samples from approximately 330 patients have been collected, including blood, urine, hair, and nails samples, as well as post-mortem specimens from up to 30 patients, such as whole brains, spinal cords, and cerebrospinal fluid. The findings of that pilot study indeed support the creation of a biorepository. <br /><br />Purpose and Objectives:<br /><br />The purpose of this contract is to establish an ongoing biorepository of specimens from persons with ALS enrolled in the National ALS Registry. <br /><br />ATSDR is particularly interested in samples such as blood, urine, saliva, hair, and nails, in addition to post-mortem specimens, such as bone, muscle, skin, whole brains, spinal cords, and cerebrospinal fluid. Collected samples (already collected via the pilot effort and future collections) may be used for the purposes such as genetic analysis, creating cell lines, or other analyses requested by CDC/ATSDR. While there are other biorepositories currently in existence that contain specimens from persons with ALS, these biorepositories are often limited and target select groups (e.g., military veterans with ALS). Additionally, these biorepositories do not necessarily collect epidemiological/risk factor data from the patients who contribute specimens (e.g., occupational, residential, and military history). Submission of specimens for this biorepository would be open to all persons with ALS enrolled in the congressionally mandated National ALS Registry. The ability to connect the biological material to information about risk factors and data about medical treatment will make the biorepository unique and especially valuable to ALS researchers. <br /><br />This contract will provide funding for the creation, operation, maintenance, cataloging, and ongoing analysis of sample supply and demand of a biorepository of specimens from persons with ALS enrolled in the National ALS Registry. <br /><br />Project Requirements.</p>
<p>The Contractor would be responsible for the following:<br /><br />1. The Contractor will establish an OMB/IRB approved biorepository linked to persons with ALS who are enrolled in the National ALS Registry, according to the specifications below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;General Requirements - <br /><br />Biorepository Biospecimen collection:<br /><br />a. Biospecimens will be collected from 300-500 ALS Registry enrollees per year. Previously collected samples from the pilot study will undergo RNA extraction (up to 1200 samples) and DNA extraction (up to 175 samples). This DNA and RNA analysis will also apply for future collections.<br /><br />b. For each biospecimen collected, the collection will include up to 70 ml blood and up to 40-50ml urine, nail clippings, hair clippings. Blood tubes will be considered for: 1 tube EDTA for DNA, 1 tube plasma, 1 tube serum, 1 tube for RNA, and 1 tube for the creation of cell lines. Saliva will be collected only if blood draw is unsuccessful and if PALS requests it in lieu of blood sample.<br /><br />c. Plasma and serum will be processed and stored in an appropriate facility in a way that will enable future analysis of DNA, RNA, chemicals, and metals.<br /><br />d. Biospecimens will be stored for a period of time determined by the COR.<br /><br />e. Biospecimens will be transferred to a facility designated by COR at the end of the contract period.<br /><br />2. The Contractor shall use the existing specimens already collected through the pilot program as the foundation for this Biorepository. This will entail working with the pilot Contractor to coordinate, gain access to, and transfer the existing retrospective samples to an appropriate facility.</p>
<p>Biorepository Post-Mortem Specimen collection:<br /><br />a. Post-mortem biospecimens will be collected from 12-30 ALS Registry enrollees per year. Previously collected samples from the pilot study will undergo RNA extraction and DNA extraction. This DNA and RNA analysis will also apply for future collections.<br /><br />b. Post-mortem biospecimens collected will include whole brain and spinal cords, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bone, muscle, and skin.<br /><br />c. Brain and spinal cord tissue will be processed and stored in an appropriate facility according to the sample protocol and procedures of the VA ALS Registry Brain Banking Program (http://www.research.va.gov/programs/tissue_banking/als/).<br /><br />d. Brain and spinal cord tissues will be subject to a standard post-mortem pathology analysis and CSF will be collected in a standardized way if specified by CDC.<br /><br />e. Post-mortem tissue samples will be stored for a period of time determined by the COR.<br /><br />f. Post-mortem tissue samples will be transferred to a facility designated by COR at the end of the contract period.</p>
<p>3. In addition to biospecimens that will be collected prospectively, the Contractor shall receive, store, and maintain the samples collected from the pilot study mentioned above as well as all new samples collected. In addition, the Contractor, with input from the government, shall determine adequate storage supply/demand of specimens. This may include obtaining new consent forms from existing participants and facilitating the necessary and appropriate IRB approvals.</p>
<p>4. The Contractor shall develop a system for matching biospecimen IDs to those of National ALS Registry participants so that specimens and epidemiological data are linked.</p>
<p>5. The Contractor shall guarantee the security of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) during the custody chain. The Contractor will transfer all PII to the Government prior to the end of the contract.</p>
<p>6. The Contractor shall work closely with the Veterans Administration (VA) to determine how Registry enrollees with military experience can become part of the VA's Brain Banking program. PALS with no military experience will be handled by the National ALS Registry's biorepository.</p>
<p>7. The Contractor shall identify an appropriate facility (ies) for storage of the repository specimens. The facility (ies) shall be Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) compliant and certified. COR acceptance of the facility (ies) is required. <br /><br />8. The Contractor shall provide the COR with quality assessment/quality control analysis procedures for all sample collections.</p>
<p>9. The Contractor shall determine specimen demand for sample requests as well as plan to market and promote the repository.</p>
<p>10. The contractor shall determine a cost-recovery mechanism for the storage and dissemination of samples.</p>
<p>11. Should scientific publications be developed based on this work, the contractor shall comply with ATSDR and CDC requirements for pre-submission review, possible co-authorship, and clearance of scientific documents.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance. One 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods.</p>
<p>Other important considerations. Deliverables in this requirement have mandated timeframes which, as a consequence are non-negotiable. It is imperative that high quality products are delivered within these strict timeframes.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate one cost reimbursement award.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:<br />The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) on behalf of PMS 320 (the Electric Ships Office) and the NAVSEA Energy Office (SEA 05T) seeking information on energy and - or heat recovery systems, heat exchangers, and advanced energy conversion technologies applicable to either diesel or gas turbine engine exhaust for use on Navy surface ships. NAVSEA seeks to determine the technology readiness level, industry capability, commercial basis, development steps, and estimated costs for such technologies. The present or near term status of these technologies may inspire investment by the Navy in characterization for Navy applications, small scale component or system development, or small business innovation research (SBIR) topics, as appropriate. Promising technologies may also be considered in military sealift operational logistics improvement applications.
<p>Description:<br />The primary objective of the engine exhaust energy recovery effort is to reduce the Navy's overall energy footprint, per Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) directive, by utilizing readily available heat that is being rejected to the atmosphere and converting it into useful work. The Navy's goal is to increase system efficiency by at least 5 percent (includes a combination both the prime mover and energy recovery system outputs) and to achieve a return on investment for any potential systems in less than 5 years. The Navy is targeting existing ship platforms that present the best opportunity for fuel savings and a favorable return on investment. The technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, readily adaptable heat exchanger(s) on the shipboard exhaust system; solid state thermo-electric energy recovery; application of novel thermodynamic cycles; and other techniques for reduction in energy losses. The focus of this request is to gain knowledge of the current and projected state of the art for improvements in heat exchanger reliability under extreme temperature transients. This section provides a set of performance characteristics that meet the needs of the notional system, which must:</p>
<p>a. Be dependent on prime mover exhaust for a heat source with seawater acting as the ultimate heat sink for the system.</p>
<p>b. Not cause the exhaust back pressure to exceed the maximum allowable for the chosen engine.</p>
<p>c. Not affect the current state of system maintainability and reliability, while also possessing very high reliability, maintainability, and availability characteristics itself, and not affect the prime mover if not in operation or if parts break. It is noted that heat exchangers, for instance, that are more reliable with less overall efficiency improvement may be more favorably viewed than more efficient technologies that are deemed less reliable.</p>
<p>d. Accept the complete range of engine exhaust temperatures, including frequent temperature transients due to engine power cycling (nominally 400 F to 1200 F) and possess rapid start-up capabilities.</p>
<p>e. Be modular and compact for minimal impact on ship architecture.</p>
<p>f. Be easy to install and replace and have easily replaceable or maintainable components.</p>
<p>g. Yield an increase in fuel efficiency of a combined system (prime mover and energy recovery system) on the order of five (5) percent. Higher yielding technologies may have a better business case for implementation, but lower yielding energy savings (that may be more appropriate in a back-fit on an existing plant) are also of interest.</p>
<p>h. Require minimal interface with the prime mover control system.</p>
<p>i. Be inherently safe to operate and maintain and shall not be made with hazardous materials or create additional hazardous environments for ship's force.</p>
<p>j. Are sufficiently robust to withstand shipboard shock, vibration, and other environmental conditions.</p>
<p>k. Require minimal system logistics support.</p>
<p>Fuels: The following fuels are available for use on Navy diesel engines and gas turbine engines: NATO F-76 fuel (MIL-F-16884 Naval Distillate) (sulfur cap of 1,000 ppmw) and NATO F-44/MIL-T-5624 Aviation Turbine Fuel, Grade JP-5 fuel (sulfur cap of 2,000 ppmw). Engines may also be capable of operating on Marine Gas Oil to ASTM D6985, when F-76 and F-44 are not available.</p>
<p>Notional Diesel Engine Operating Conditions: The Navy is considering the CAT 3608 diesel engine and the Colt-Pielstick PA6B diesel engine for evaluation. Exhaust gas temperatures for the CAT 3608 diesel engine range from approximately 750 F at 25 percent load, 870 F at 50 percent load to 840 F at full load. The exhaust back pressure ranges from 5.0 - 10.0 inches water. The exhaust gas mass flow rate for the CAT 3608 diesel engine range from 4 lbm/s to 10 lbm/s. Exhaust gas temperatures for the Colt-Pielstick PA6B diesel engine range from approximately 700 F at 25 percent load, 740 F at 50 percent load to 720 F at full load. The exhaust back pressure ranges from 5.0 - 13.0 inches water. The exhaust gas mass flow rate for the PA6B diesel engine range from 5 lbm/s to 17 lbm/s.</p>
<p>Notional Gas Turbine Engine Operating Conditions: There are two types of gas turbine engines in consideration: ship service gas turbine generators (SSGTGs) and main propulsion gas turbine engines (MPGTEs). Post-turbine temperatures for dry exhaust for SSGTGs range from approximately 600 F at 25 percent load to 1200 F at full load and the maximum specified exhaust back pressure is 6.0 inches water. The exhaust gas mass flow rate for SSGTGs range from 28 lbm/s to 34 lbm/s. The generators run at approximately 50 percent of rated power most of the time, with a corresponding exhaust temperature of approximately 750 F. Two common MPGTEs within the Navy are the MT30 and the LM2500 gas turbine engines. The exhaust conditions at rated power for the MT30 are approximately 250 lbm/s at 860 F, while the exhaust conditions for the LM2500 at rated power are approximately 150 lbm/s at 1050 F. It must be noted, however, that these engines rarely run at 100 percent rated power. Due to rapid startup capabilities, gas turbine engine exhaust can increase from ambient conditions to approximately 1200 F within one minute during startup. Any piece of equipment exposed to the exhaust must be able to withstand this thermal transient without failing.</p>
<p>Responses:<br />The Navy is seeking to identify promising engine exhaust energy recovery technologies, notionally TRL 5 and above, that as part of a system would yield increased fuel efficiency with the aforementioned engines and under the aforementioned conditions. The Navy is looking for any relevant information that the vendor is able to provide regarding a potential solution and the "balance of plant" impacts for shipboard use. Responses should be limited to 20 pages or less (not including any drawings or sketches). Examples of this information include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>a. Name (and model or designation if available) of technology.</p>
<p>b. The technology readiness level (the state of the art).</p>
<p>c. Industry capability.</p>
<p>d. Commercial basis (where has the technology been fielded at scale, units in the field and maximum hours accumulated per unit).</p>
<p>e. Development steps (where further effort is necessary to deliver a field-able in a US Navy surface ship, and time required for completing the development).</p>
<p>f. Estimated costs for such technologies (development and production), preferably on a per kW basis.</p>
<p>g. Estimated energy recovered and the net work output (preferably in kW). The utility of the useful work derived from the energy recovered may be applied to augmentation of HVAC, improving operating prime mover efficiency, added electric power output, or something else yet to be quantified.</p>
<p>h. A simplified flow schematic that displays major component.</p>
<p>i. Thermodynamic data at all major states, including, but not limited to, temperature, pressure, flow rate, efficiency/effectiveness, enthalpy, and entropy.</p>
<p>j. Estimated dimensions (in.), volume (in.3), and weight (lb.).</p>
<p>k. Materials list (all detrimental and hazardous materials used in the system must be specifically identified including any special disposal/handling instruction).</p>
<p>l. Operational limitations (e.g. fuel sulfur, etc.).</p>
<p>m. Applicable laboratory test data (e.g. performance, reliability, maintenance, and durability, etc.).</p>
<p>n. Applicable field test data (e.g. performance, reliability, maintenance, and durability, etc.).</p>
<p>o. Description of technology and operating principles (relevant SAE technical papers or other peer-reviewed published papers would be of assistance).</p>
<p>p. Maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>q. Reliability (durability) estimate.</p>
<p>r. Logistics footprint estimate.</p>
<p>s. If the technology or system could impact prime mover operation, the specific scenarios must be outlined with impacts and recovery methods.</p>
<p>t. Anticipated fouling and related changes in back pressure based on engine load profiles and time, and anticipated consequences of failure of heat exchanger parts.</p>
<p>Responses and comments are requested by 5:00 pm (EST), on June 1, 2015. However, submissions will be accepted after this date, but feedback may not be as timely or contribute to NAVSEA's strategic planning. Responses should indicate enough detail so that potential Navy interest can be assessed. Responses are requested to be provided electronically and acceptable formats include Adobe PDF, Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint files. All inquiries and comment submissions should be emailed to joseph.tannenbaum@navy.mil and matthew.legler@navy.mil. The information provided will assist NAVSEA in developing and further defining future procurement and acquisition strategies and it is desirable that it not contain proprietary information. However, if some of the information provided is considered proprietary to the respondent, that portion shall be segregated and labeled as such and will be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider.</p>
<p>This RFI in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies. Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate. This RFI is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government. NAVSEA may request further information regarding the capabilities of respondents to meet the requirements and may request a presentation and/or a site visit as deemed necessary. No written responses will be returned.</p>
<p>Further, the Navy is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/). It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>

The contractor must understand how advanced education plays into the career of an Air Force officer and the needs of the Air Force. Background in advanced education is vital to this contract. Extensive knowledge of and experience with the AFERB (Air Force Education Review Board) selection process, as well as the enterprise-wide Colleague student information system and the OnBase digital document management system are critical to the performance of these responsibilities. Eligibility for entrance into advanced degrees is critical to the process. Selectee must know how to determine eligibility for admittance to the programs. This individual must also understand program requirements, graduation requirements, how quota is determined by AFPC and the selection process for filling AFIT (Air Force Institute of Technology) quotas.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>

<p>The USDA National Animal Disease Center in Ames, IA, intends to award the procurement of the production of 9 recombinant turkey proteins for the immunization of laboratory animals to generate turkey-specific monoclonal antibodies to Genscript Corp. This production will include the use of BacPower Guaranteed Protein Service, producing a minimum of 75% pure recombinant 6X-histidine tagged turkey proteins. In addition, the contractor will provide the MonoExpress Basic Antibody Service producing up to 5 antigen-specific hybridomas per each recombinant turkey protein. Initial supernatants of the hybridomas must be delivered to the USDA researcher within 45 days of animal immunization for the researcher to evaluate. Contractor will be required to perform associated activities for this project (e.g., codon optimization of gene, gene synthesis, subcloning, protein expression and purification, animal immunization, hybridoma generation, hybridoma screening, determination of ELISA titer, western blot reactivity and immunoglobulin purification) in-house. Work on generating all 9 turkey recombinant proteins and hybridomas must be performed simultaneously to expedite results. All hybridomas for this product produced must remain intellectual property of the United States Department of Agriculture. Delivery of all completed project materials (e.g., recombinant protein expression, hybridomas and purified monoclonal antibodies) must be guaranteed to the USDA researcher by August 31, 2015.</p>
<p>This procurement will be conducted in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 13.106 and 6.303-2. The purchase determination is based on the requirement of the simultaneous produced product. No known contractors are able to provide the required antibodies in the necessary timeframe as required for ongoing research. The cost has been determined fair and reasonable based on current technical knowledge of fair market value. The anticipated purchase order value is $48,342.00.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotation. However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can produce the necessary recombinant proteins, hybridomas and purified monoclonal antibodies. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to lara.j.hicok@aphis.usda.gov. The deadline for the submittal of responses is 12:00 pm Central Standard Time, March 30, 2015.</p>

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) - Fort Jackson, South Carolina, intends to issue a firm fixed price, sole source award to Gregory Pest Control Inc, 1313 Miller Rd, Greenville, SC 29607-5711 for Integrated Pest Management services at Fort Jackson, SC.  <br>  <br> This procurement is being conducted under FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1). To solicit to another source would cause unacceptable disruption to pest control operations. Based on delays with award of a follow-on contract, it is not feasible to switch contractors for a maximum potential period of five months while the competitive follow-on action is completed.  Doing so would disrupt critical mission operations and cause the Government to incur significant costs. It is more advantageous to the Government to continue the contract services with the incumbent contractor for a maximum of five months while the follow-on acquisition is completed.   <br>  <br> The anticipated award date is March 31, 2015. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 561710 and the size standard is $11 million. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement was based on responses to the previous sources sought notice. A solicitation will not be issued.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Promega Corporation, 2800 Woods Hollow Road, Madison, WI 53711. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p><br />This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 334513, Instruments and Related Products Manufacturing for Measuring, Displaying, and Controlling Industrial Process Variables; the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to award a non-competitive, sole source contract to Promega Corporation, 2800 Woods Hollow Road, Madison, WI 53711for Promega PowerSeq kits and Promega PowerPlex kits.</p>
<p>The FBI is currently validating the Promega PowerPlex kits for use within the laboratory. PowerPlex Y23 is a Y STR specific amplification kit, and contains much more genetic information than the kit currently used by the FBI for casework. Historically Y STR typing has only been sufficient to identify males of the same genetic lineage; however, the PowerPlex kit contains rapidly mutating loci which may be sufficient to distinguish males from one generation to the next. Identification of male specific DNA is important in sexual assault samples where there may be a mixture of male and female DNA.</p>
<p>The FBI is also evaluating Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies to support the FBI Laboratory's DNA program activities by advancing the technologies applied to DNA casework and expanding the FBIs DNA typing capabilities. Promega PowerSeq kits offer NGS assays that target the 13 core CODIS STR markers. The FBI requires the Promega PowerSeq kit in order for to properly assess the maturity of all commercially available NGS STR products on the market.</p>
<p>Promega Corporation is the sole-manufacturer and sole-provider of the R&amp;D Product (PowerSeq Auto/Mito/Y - 100 reactions) and the PowerPlex &reg; Y23 System, 200rxn that is needed to meet the FBI's requirement.</p>
<p>Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement can only be provided by Promega Corporation as they are the sole-manufacturer and supplier of this product.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to this office by 08:00 am, EST, March 30, 2015, by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.</p>

The order is expected to be awarded under FAR 6.302-1. A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared. Delivery is anticipated 20 weeks after receipt of order.<br /><br />The purchase order will be for a FANUC America Corporation manufactured robotic system that supports NIST's Engineering Laboratory - Intelligent Systems Division's (ISD) ongoing activities to develop, advance and deploy measurement science and standards to advance U.S. Manufacturing. The robotic system is only available for distribution to the mid-Atlantic region from Diversified Educational Systems, Inc.<br /><br />The FANUC LR Mate 200iD is the only robotic arm that is compatible with the software and real testing environment that is being used in ISD's collaborative research with Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI). Specific interfaces and physical implementations of the agility architecture have been developed for this robot arm. These interfaces and implementations would not work on other robot arms. No other known product possesses the required features to run the software. If this robot is not purchased, we will not be able to validate the agility architecture that has been developed which would cause significant risk to industrial partners that are interested in implementing it due to its lack of validation.<br /><br />Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. <strong>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS</strong>. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

All comments received will be posted without change to http://www.regulations.gov, including any personal and/or business confidential information provided.<br />FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Cecelia L. Davis, Procurement Analyst, at (202) 219-0202 for clarification of content. For information pertaining to status or publication schedules, contact the Regulatory Secretariat at 202-501-4755. Please cite FAR Case 2015-001.<br />SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:<br />I. Background<br />A. The Buy American statute (41 U.S.C. chapter 83) generally requires that only domestically mined, produced, or<br />manufactured articles be procured for public use in the United States. The Buy American statute provides an exception for articles not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality. FAR 25.103(b)(1) provides a determination that articles listed at FAR 25.104(a) meet the conditions of this exception. This determination does not necessarily mean that there is no domestic source for the listed items, but that domestic sources can only meet 50 percent or less of total U.S. Government and nongovernment demand.<br />The established list of articles identified in FAR 25.104(a) is a comprehensive and wide-ranging mix of natural resources, compounds, materials, and other items of supply. Although some articles on the list have no known domestic production sources (e.g. vanilla beans), many of the articles are known to have some domestic production sources, but those sources have been determined in the past to be inadequate to meet U.S. demand. Examples of such articles range from goat and kidskins (negligible domestic production), to crude iodine (5 percent of U.S. Government and nongovernment demand), to bismuth (not in excess of 50 percent of U.S. Government and nongovernment demand). <br />The list is reviewed every five years, as required by FAR 25.104(b). DoD, GSA, and NASA last published in the Federal Register a request for public comment on the list on August 7, 2009 (74 FR 39597). <br />The Councils are seeking information to determine whether <br />some articles should be removed from the list because they are now mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality. Specific information with regard to domestic production capacity in relation to U.S. Government and nongovernment demand and the quality of domestically produced items would be most helpful in determining whether articles should remain on or be removed from the list. A sources-sought notice will be published in FedBizOpps in an effort to increase the awareness of this request and to receive greater <br />responses from interested parties on the nonavailable articles listing.<br />B. The current domestically nonavailable listing at FAR 25.104 is as follow:<br />Acetylene, black. <br />Agar, bulk. <br />Anise. <br />Antimony, as metal or oxide. <br />Asbestos, amosite, chrysotile, and crocidolite. <br />Bamboo shoots. <br />Bananas. <br />Bauxite. <br />Beef, corned, canned. <br />Beef extract. <br />Bephenium hydroxynapthoate. <br />Bismuth. <br />Books, trade, text, technical, or scientific; newspapers; pamphlets; magazines; periodicals; printed briefs and films; not printed in the United States and for which domestic editions are not available. <br />Brazil nuts, unroasted. <br />Cadmium, ores and flue dust. <br />Calcium cyanamide. <br />Capers. <br />Cashew nuts. <br />Castor beans and castor oil. <br />Chalk, English. <br />Chestnuts. <br />Chicle. <br />Chrome ore or chromite. <br />Cinchona bark. <br />Cobalt, in cathodes, rondelles, or other primary ore and metal forms. <br />Cocoa beans. <br />Coconut and coconut meat, unsweetened, in shredded, desiccated, or similarly prepared form. <br />Coffee, raw or green bean. <br />Colchicine alkaloid, raw. <br />Copra. <br />Cork, wood or bark and waste. <br />Cover glass, microscope slide. <br />Crane rail (85-pound per foot). <br />Cryolite, natural. <br />Dammar gum. <br />Diamonds, industrial, stones and abrasives. <br />Emetine, bulk. <br />Ergot, crude. <br />Erythrityl tetranitrate. <br />Fair linen, altar. <br />Fibers of the following types: abaca, abace, agave, coir, flax, jute, jute burlaps, palmyra, and sisal. <br />Goat and kidskins. <br />Goat hair canvas. <br />Grapefruit sections, canned. <br />Graphite, natural, crystalline, crucible grade. <br />Hand file sets (Swiss pattern). <br />Handsewing needles. <br />Hemp yarn. <br />Hog bristles for brushes. <br />Hyoscine, bulk. <br />Ipecac, root. <br />Iodine, crude. <br />Kaurigum. <br />Lac. <br />Leather, sheepskin, hair type. <br />Lavender oil. <br />Manganese. <br />Menthol, natural bulk. <br />Mica. <br />Microprocessor chips (brought onto a Government construction site as separate units for incorporation into building systems during construction or repair and alteration of real property). <br />Modacrylic fiber. <br />Nickel, primary, in ingots, pigs, shots, cathodes, or similar forms; nickel oxide and nickel salts. <br />Nitroguanidine (also known as picrite). <br />Nux vomica, crude. <br />Oiticica oil. <br />Olive oil. <br />Olives (green), pitted or unpitted, or stuffed, in bulk. <br />Opium, crude. <br />Oranges, mandarin, canned. <br />Petroleum, crude oil, unfinished oils, and finished products. <br />Pine needle oil. <br />Pineapple, canned. <br />Platinum and related group metals, refined, as sponge, powder, ingots, or cast bars. <br />Pyrethrum flowers. <br />Quartz crystals. <br />Quebracho. <br />Quinidine. <br />Quinine. <br />Rabbit fur felt. <br />Radium salts, source and special nuclear materials. <br />Rosettes. <br />Rubber, crude and latex. <br />Rutile. <br />Santonin, crude. <br />Secretin. <br />Shellac. <br />Silk, raw and unmanufactured. <br />Spare and replacement parts for equipment of foreign manufacture, and for which domestic parts are not available. <br />Spices and herbs, in bulk. <br />Sugars, raw. <br />Swords and scabbards. <br />Talc, block, steatite. <br />Tantalum. <br />Tapioca flour and cassava. <br />Tartar, crude; tartaric acid and cream of tartar in bulk. <br />Tea in bulk. <br />Thread, metallic (gold). <br />Thyme oil. <br />Tin in bars, blocks, and pigs. <br />Triprolidine hydrochloride. <br />Tungsten. <br />Vanilla beans. <br />Venom, cobra. <br />Water chestnuts. <br />Wax, carnauba. <br />Wire glass. <br />Woods; logs, veneer, and lumber of the following species: Alaskan yellow cedar, angelique, balsa, ekki, greenheart, lignum vitae, mahogany, and teak. <br />Yarn, 50 Denier rayon. <br />Yeast, active dry and instant active dry. <br />II. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563<br />Executive Orders (E.O.s) 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). E.O. 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This is not a significant regulatory action and, therefore, was not subject to review under Section 6(b) of E.O. 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993. This rule is not a major rule under 5 U.S.C. 804.<br />List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 25<br />Government procurement.

<CONTACT>Galvin, Daniel
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey Leetown Science Center (LSC) has a need to renovate and retrofit an existing wet laboratory to develop and install standard operating procedure items for a Biosafety Level 3 Aquaculture Equivalent Laboratory (BSL-3 Aquaculture Lab).  The lab is located in Kearneysville, West Virginia.

A partial list of requirements includes:  1) Develop and install three anterooms, the first providing access into the Primary Hygiene area and two additional anterooms, one leading into the high containment laboratory and the other leading into the waste water treatment room associated with the high containment laboratory.  These anterooms will aid in the creation of rooms with increasingly negative pressure moving from outside the BSL-3 Lab into the high containment laboratory; 2) Move the air supply from the 15 ton AHU to the 25 ton AHU to feed the three anterooms and the water treatment room3. Install some new duct work above the anterooms to be constructed as part of this SOW; 4) Develop and install a HEPA filter system to existing exhaust system (at least 9 exhausts); 5) Develop a bioseal for the set of double doors that lead directly into the high containment laboratory from an adjacent wet lab that can be broken and resealed after bringing in additional large tanks for fish and other aquatic species research. 6). Tie in two existing Aaon units into the existing building controls.
All interested firms may submit a response by March 18, 2015 demonstrating their capabilities and experience to perform the requested service to the primary contact below.  Interested firms should have prior experience in design and construction of high containment, Biosafety Level 3 and/or Biosafety Level 4 Laboratories. Design and construction of hospital laboratories is insufficient.

Firms responding should indicate their socioeconomic status (e.g. small business, service disabled veteran, woman/women owned, HUBZone, etc.).  The Governments evaluation of the capabilities of respondents will factor into whether the forthcoming solicitation will be conducted using full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses or small business designation.  This requirement is expected to result in the award of a firm-fixed price contract.

The estimated magnitude of construction is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.

The NAICS code is 236220.  The size standard is $36.5 million.

Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary.  This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in responses to this notice.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Award will be made to the offeror who provides the lowest total evaluated price, who is deemed responsible, and who is compliant with all the requirements of this solicitation, to include submission requirements listed under  quote mark Quote Submission Requirements quote mark  below.  Award will be made on a Firm Fixed Price basis.  Price evaluation is as follows: <br>  <br>  <br> 1. The offeror will enter unit prices for all shoe styles for the base year and each evaluated option year on the Price Evaluation Spreadsheet's first tab titled Summary of Unit Prices.  All unit prices shall be binding. <br>  <br> 2. The Government reserves the right to require submission of any data necessary to validate the reasonableness of an offer. <br>  <br> 3. The Government will evaluate offers based on unit prices proposed for the base and each evaluated option year and any other price related factors required by the solicitation.  If an offeror fails to propose for all of the unit prices or base and evaluated option years, the Government may reject that offer as unacceptable. <br>  <br> 4. For each proposal, the Government shall calculate a weighted evaluated price by multiplying the proposed unit prices by their respected weights, and summing their totals.  The weight associated with each unit price, represents the likelihood that an order, if placed, would be placed for that shoe style at the quoted unit price. <br>  <br> 5. A Total Evaluated Price shall be determined by summing the weighted evaluated prices for the base year and each evaluated option year and any other price related factors required by the solicitation. <br>  <br> 6. Price Analysis shall be used to determine price reasonableness.  Additional analysis techniques may be used as determined necessary by the Procuring Contracting Officer.  These methods of evaluation may include the use of information/input from sources such as (but not limited to) other Government agencies and personnel. <br>  <br> 7. As part of the evaluation, proposals may be reviewed to identify any significant unbalanced pricing found between the base year and evaluated option years.  In accordance with FAR 15.404-1(g), i.e., Unbalanced Pricing, a proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. <br>  <br> CLAUSES: <br>  <br> See Attachment 0002 - Contract Clauses for the clauses which are applicable to this solicitation. <br>  <br> QUOTE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: <br>  <br> Offerors shall submit quotes by completing Attachment 0003 - Price Evaluation Spreadsheet.   <br>  <br> In the event an offeror is not registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), the offeror shall fill-in and return FAR Clause 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items located in Attachment 0002 - Contract Clauses.

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Bogota, Colombia<br />9. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br /><br />The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State. INL's program in Colombia builds on efforts begun under Plan Colombia, with focus shifting from the extensive provision of equipment and logistical support towards supporting the Colombian government's institutional reforms and strengthening professional capacities within the police and criminal justice sector. The INL Section in the Embassy in Bogota manages an illicit drug interdiction and law enforcement assistance program funded through the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) account and destined for Colombia.<br />INCLE-funded assistance complements the Colombian government's counternarcotic activities designed to deter, detect, and disrupt transnational organized crime groups in Colombia and throughout the region. It also complements the Colombian government's even larger investment in promoting rule of law; providing for citizen security; and reforming state institutions to foster greater transparency, responsiveness, and respect for human rights. The goal of this program is to improve and institutionalize Colombian interdiction capabilities through targeted, sustainable projects.<br />The prospect of a potential peace agreement between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) provides a potentially important window of opportunity for further reform of the security services and the criminal justice system. As the Government of Colombia prepares to implement a peace agreement, it must marshal sufficient resources to extend effective security and justice services to former conflict areas. While the main emphasis of INL's interdiction program is and has been counternarcotic, it will be important for the program going forward to address broader transnational crime problems and enhanced institutional capabilities. <br /><br />PURPOSE:<br /><br />The Interdiction Police Advisor will support, assist, and advise INL and the U.S. Embassy in Colombia in their efforts to help Colombia interdict narcotics and criminal trafficking groups. Besides managing training, mentoring, technical assistance, and limited equipment procurements to support Colombian security forces and judicial authorities, the Interdiction Advisor will also liaise with, and coordinate, the activities of USG agency implementers in the justice sector reform area as it relates to the professionalization, training, and operations of law enforcement personnel. The Interdiction Police Advisor will play a key role in shaping future program design and engagement strategies with the Colombian government. <br />The Interdiction Police Advisor will provide expertise in a wide variety of settings, including internal U.S. embassy and multi-national meetings, to assist the Colombian government in reaching its stated counternarcotic goals and objectives. S/he will offer assistance in a variety of areas, to include counternarcotic policy development and coordination with the interagency and international community and counternarcotic program development, management, and oversight. <br />The Interdiction Police Advisor will oversee the implementation of INL's civilian law enforcement engagement with Colombia's Antinarcotics, Judicial, and Intelligence police, as well as assist the Interdiction Director in maintaining INL's relationships with senior Colombian police officials. This includes, but is not limited to, coordination with Colombian authorities, management of police training, curriculum development, logistical and security planning, vendor/contractor coordination, and commodity provision to host nation law enforcement entities. <br />The Interdiction Police Advisor frequently meets with members of other U.S. Government agencies, non- governmental organizations (NGOs), and relevant international organizations for the purpose of gathering and disseminating information pertinent to interdiction/police development and USG priorities and activities.<br />The Interdiction Police Advisor will be expected to know or master the full range of assistance project management skills, including planning, budgeting, procurement, contracting, monitoring, reporting, and evaluation.

POSITION TITLE: INL Senior Advisor: Presidential Proclamation 7750<br />6. MARKET VALUE: $107,325 - $139,523 (GS-14 Equivalent)<br />7. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year from date of award and four option years<br />8. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Washington, DC<br />9. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:<br />The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), Office of Anti-Crime Programs' (INL/C) Anticorruption Team plays a leadership role in INL, the Department, and the inter-agency in combating corruption and kleptocracy (high-level corruption) internationally. The team's principal roles are 1) policy development and 2) development and management of multilateral anticorruption processes and special (bilateral and thematic) initiatives. INL/C also manages a small program portfolio, tied to our diplomatic initiatives, and administers authorities to deny entry to the United States of corrupt officials and those who enable or benefit from their corruption. The team can also provide backstopping to INL regional offices on development and implementation of bilateral programs with an anticorruption or good governance component. The team is the USG lead, working closely with DOJ, Treasury, DHS, the Office of Government Ethics, and other partners, in several key international anticorruption efforts, with a focus on adoption of international standards and concrete follow-up action. The Anticorruption team also implements Presidential Proclamation 7750 (PP 7750), issued under the provisions of Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (7031), which allows the President, by Proclamation, to exclude from the US any group of aliens he considers to be detrimental to the US national interest. The President delegated responsibility for executing the provisions of PP 7750 to the Secretary, and the Secretary delegated decision authority to P and processing responsibility to INL. Cases are handled by means of an action memo to P, with extensive vetting and clearances throughout the Department required before the memo is finalized for transmission. Many other potential cases are adjudicated using other available legal authorities in the INA through close cooperation with CA/Visa Office in finding firm visa ineligibilities on other than PP 7750 grounds.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The INL/C Senior Advisor serves as the Department's lead on the implementation of PP 7750 and 7031, drafts the related Congressionally-mandated reports, and raises awareness about these authorities through routine engagement with other DOS offices and Embassies abroad. The Senior Advisor will also liaise extensively with the interagency to develop cases.</p>
<p>Relationship<br />The Senior Advisor reports to the INL/C Director in performing the requirements of the Statement of Work. The Office Director will act as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>

3.7 QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN

INTRODUCTION

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) has been developed to evaluate contractor actions while implementing this Performance Work Statement (PWS). It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring contractor performance for each listed objective on the Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) in the janitorial contract.

The QASP provides a systematic method to evaluate the services the contractor is required to furnish. 
This QASP is based on the premise the Government desires to maintain a quality standard in operating, maintaining, and repairing facilities and that a service contract to provide the service is the best means of achieving that objective. The contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the Government is quality assurance to ensure contract standards are achieved. In this contract the quality control program is the driver for product quality. The contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of inspections and monitoring actions. The first major step to ensuring a "self-correcting" contract is to ensure that the quality control program approved at the beginning of the contract provides the measures needed to lead the contractor to success. Once the quality control program is approved, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust quality assurance program.

3.8 SURVEILLANCE 
The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will receive complaints from Government personnel and pass them to the contractor's quality control inspector (QCI) for correction, as well as do daily random spot checks within the facility. The COR will have the responsibility for completing QA monitoring forms used to document the inspection and evaluation of the contractor's work performance.  

3.9 PERFORMANCE THRESHOLD 
The performance threshold for each of the requirement sections within the scope of work has their own threshold value based on the frequency and scope of the requirements in the section. An incident can merit multiple infractions based on the scope of the infraction (ex. the majority of the carpets are not cleaned properly, the majority of the hallway is not mopped, waxed or buffed properly, the majority of the windows are not properly cleaned).  The COR shall notify the Contracting Officer for appropriate action in accordance with FAR 52.212.4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (February 2007) or the appropriate Inspection of Services clause, if any of the above service areas exceed the  customer complaints.

3.10 METHODOLOGIES TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE
In an effort to minimize the contract administration burden, simplified methods of surveillance techniques shall be used by the Government to evaluate contractor performance. The primary methods of surveillance are random checks, observations, inspections, complaints and review of those records and files that are required to be maintained and delivered under this statement of work. The Government will use appointed representatives, as well as reports and input from Center employees and visitors as sources of comments on the contractor's performance.

The contractor is expected to establish and maintain professional communication between its employees and customers. The primary objective of professional communication between employees and customers is customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is the most significant external indicator of the success and effectiveness of all services provided and can be measured through customer complaints. Performance management drives the contractor to be customer focused through initially addressing customer complaints and investigating the issues and/or problems. 

The acceptable quality levels (AQL) located in the Table 1: Performance Requirements for contractor performance are structured to allow the contractor to manage how the work is performed while providing negative incentives for performance shortfalls.

3.11 FAILURE TO PERFORM
The contractor may receive deductions or even termination based on failure to perform.  The following criteria apply for determining appropriate action:
1.	Notifications.  Consistent with FAR Part 49, the CO shall notify the service provider of failure to meet standards through QA monitoring forms, cure notices, or show cause notices and shall inform the service provider manager or designated alternate of such notices.
2.	Deductions.  The Government has the right to deduct a specified dollar amount for failure to meet performance standards.  The amount is identified in Table 1.
3.	Termination.  If the CO determines that the contractor has failed to perform to the extent that a termination for default is justified, the CO shall issue a notice of termination, consistent with FAR Part 49. This consists of failing to meet the performance thresholds for three consecutive months. Failure to meet the performance thresholds for four cumulative months in an option period will be considered grounds for not awarding the following option period.

3.12 SITE VISIT WALKTHROUGH

There will be an optional contractor walkthrough of each facility on Wednesday April 1, 2015.  It is mandatory that each contractor RSVP to Les Lecceardone by email (Les.Lecceardone@va.gov) or telephone (585-393-8035) by 2:00 pm on March 31, 2015 if you plan to attend the walkthrough.

The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.<br />(End of Clause)<br /><br />52.211-16-VARIATION IN QUANTITY (APR 1984)</p>

<p>(b) The permissible variation shall be limited to:</p>
<p>10 Percent increase</p>
<p>10 Percent decrease</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Yankauer Suction Tips. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Yankauer Suction Tips products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Yankauer Suction Tips. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Maryann DiMeo at DLA Troop Support, maryann.dimeo@dla.mil, 215-737-3201.</p>
<p>The QSL for Yankauer Suction Tips will be established approximately June 2015 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately July 2015 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Yankauer Suction Tips. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Yankauer Suction Tips.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Yankauer Suction Tips. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $345,205. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Seven items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 99.3% ($343,055) of the total volume in sales ($345,205). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt; allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action</strong>.</p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>
<p>Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

<p>An anaerobic chamber with an airlock system is essential to study the mechanisms employed by C. difficile which cannot grow in the presence of any oxygen therefore survival is reliant under anaerobic conditions. An anaerobic chamber needs a hydrogen sulfide removal system (HSRC) because C. difficile produces hydrogen sulfide gas which is extremely reactive and corrosive which can damage any instruments in the chamber. A second smaller chamber on the opposite side of the airlock is required to house sensitive equipment that would be damaged by the presence of bacterial by products on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Minimum Technical Specifications:</p>
<p>&bull; The anaerobic chamber system shall consist of two anaerobic chambers linked by a central airlock system. One of these chambers shall be approximately 22 - 26 cubic feet in size with 4 side-by-side glove ports to allow for two people working simultaneously. The second chamber shall be approximately 12 - 16 cubic feet in size with 2 glove ports to allow for one person to work within the chamber. <br />&bull; The anaerobic chamber system shall be capable of maintaining an atmosphere below 5 ppm oxygen using combination of a hydrogen gas mix reacting with a palladium catalyst to remove oxygen.<br />&bull; The anaerobic chamber system shall include two oxygen/hydrogen analyzers (one per chamber) <br />&bull; The temperature of each chamber interior shall be adjustable up to 40o C (+/- 1oC).<br />&bull; Each chamber shall include solid state dehumidifier for moisture removal which drains to the exterior of the chambers.<br />&bull; The anaerobic chamber system shall include a proven method for the removal of hydrogen sulfide. This system shall also include an indicator to determine when replacement is necessary. <br />&bull; The chambers shall be constructed of clear PVC (polyvinyl chloride) vinyl. The chambers shall be designed for use as a gloved system (closed system). <br />&bull; The glove ports shall be constructed of highly flexible PVC vinyl and capable of changing gloves without affecting the internal atmosphere of the chamber.<br />&bull; The chamber system shall be equipped with a single, three door airlock system. This airlock system shall have the following requirements:<br />o at least 1.4 cubic feet of pass through space<br />o microcomputer controlled<br />o status lights and audible alarm for low gas<br />o independent manual controls which operate even when the automatic system is not functioning<br />o capable of adjusting number of cycles<br />o allow the user to adjust vacuum levels<br />o equipped with self-calibrating sensor and user controlled pressure adjustments for routine maintenance<br />&bull; The chamber shall not expel interior atmosphere to the room atmosphere whenever use of the arms displaces the gas mixture.<br />&bull; The combined interior space of both chambers shall provide at least 100 cubic feet of interior volume and 30 square feet of work space<br />&bull; Each chamber shall be equipped with at least one 1.5 inch port for electrical wiring/tubing for access to chamber interior. <br />&bull; Heated fan(s) for each chamber<br />&bull; Oxygen and humidity control elements which facilitate the necessary reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to eliminate oxygen and maintain the anaerobic environment and maintain low humidity. <br />&bull; The anaerobic chamber system shall also include:<br />o 3 - pair of neoprene replacement gloves<br />o 1 - vacuum pump<br />o 2 - six-receptacle electric outlet, with ON/OFF switch and circuit breaker (one per chamber)<br />o 2 - gas regulators<br />o Copper tubing<br />o Workbench with casters to hold system</p>

<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Volume 1 - Technical Approach</span></strong></p>
<p><br />The Offeror shall provide a complete and detailed description of its ability to deliver all the services described in the SOW.&nbsp; The Offeror must demonstrate a clear understanding of the scope of work and requirements including the quality, feasibility, practicability, innovativeness, and appropriateness in accomplishing tasks and deliverables of this contract from a technical perspective.

<p><br />NOTE: The submission of Past Performance Questionnaires is not required.&nbsp; Offerors shall ensure that the Past Performance information is submitted in an original and redacted format.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), Offerors without relevant past performance experience, or for whom information on past performance is not available, shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.<br /><br />Offerors must provide a minimum of three (3) Past Performance descriptions to include the following:&nbsp; name of reference; person's title; agency; telephone / cell phone number; e-mail address; contract / order number; contract type; description of work performed; whether or not the contract was performed as a Prime or Subcontractor; and total dollar value.<br /><br /><br /><strong>NOTE ON SUBCONTRACTOR PAST PERFORMANCE:</strong>&nbsp; If the Offeror submits Past Performance information for work performed as a Subcontractor, then the Past Performance point of contact shall be the Prime Contractor NOT the resulting Customer for whom the services were performed.<br /><br />Offerors shall submit a total of three (3) contract references which are recent and relevant.&nbsp; A recent contract is one which is currently being performed, or which was performed, for a minimum of twelve (12) months within the last three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation. Relevant contracts are defined as efforts that are the same as, or similar to, the scope of the efforts required by this solicitation. <br /><br />The contracts identified shall demonstrate the Offeror's performance, or responsibility for performance, of work of similar size and scope to the work outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW).<br /><br />The Government may also utilize the Contractor Performance Assessment Reports (CPAR) contained in the Government's Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) to evaluate past performance.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Volume 3 - Price Proposal</span></strong></p>
<p>Offerors shall provide labor categories and labor rates, as well as the labor hours for each, to perform the resultant contract. The Offeror's labor category titles shall be clearly mapped / associated to the corresponding solicitation labor category titles.<br /><br /><br /><strong>THE GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGES ALL OFFERORS TO OFFER DISCOUNTS OFF LABOR CATEGORY RATES.<br /><br /><br /></strong></p>
<p>The ceiling price for purposes of FAR 52.232-7, Payments Under Time and Materials or Labor Hour Contracts, is the sum total Not-to-Exceed (NTE) ceiling price amount for all Time and Materials (T&amp;M) contract line items combined (not including option line items that have not been exercised) for the current year of the contract.</p>
<p>In performing the contract, the Contractor is authorized to vary the quantity of labor hours performed between the labor categories set forth in this contract, subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), and provided the total amount of labor performed and invoiced in aggregate does not exceed the total funded amount for labor or the total not-to-exceed ceiling price amount for labor, whichever is lower.&nbsp; Should the Contractor exceed the ceiling, they shall do so at their own risk.</p>
<p>The individual quantities shown in the contract for each labor category CLIN are estimates only.&nbsp; For purposes of this clause, "total funded amount" and "total not-to-exceed ceiling price amount" refer to the amounts applicable to the current contract period being performed by the Contractor.&nbsp; For example, when performing Option Year One, the Contractor shall not exceed the total funded amount or total not-to-exceed ceiling price amount for labor.&nbsp; The total is calculated by summing the extended price and funded amounts for all labor line items combined for Option Year One.</p>
<p>Unexpended hours and ceiling price amounts from prior or future contract years will not carry over or be applied to the current year.&nbsp; <strong>Any variance to the hours performed by the Contractor within the parameters of this clause are authorized and do not require a modification to the contract.</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor is authorized to incur and bill up to the Not-to-Exceed (NTE) ceiling price amounts of Other Direct Costs (ODCs), or the funded amounts for ODCs, whichever is lower, stated on the contract for the applicable contract year.</p>
<p>Funding and ceiling shall not be intermingled between Labor and ODCs.</p>
<p>The Department of Labor (DOL) Office of the Chief Financial Officer is authorized to make payments against the Contractor's invoices based on actuals, including any variances in labor hours, as long as the variance does not result in the Contractor exceeding the total contract funded amounts and total not-to-exceed ceiling price amounts as described above.<br /><br /><strong>Prices and pricing information shall&nbsp;not be included in any part of the non-price proposal.</strong> <br /><br />All Offerors shall utilize an estimated start date of May 01, 2015.</p>
<p>Offerors shall indicate what markup percentage, if any, they will bill for ODCs. Profit will not be permitted on ODCs. The Government will evaluate the ODC CLINs by applying the Offeror's markup percentage, if any, to the ODC amounts in the solicitation.</p>
<p><br />(8.) The evaluation procedures to be used are as follows:<br /><br /><br /><strong>BASIS FOR AWARD</strong></p>
<p>(a) The Government will use a Best Value Tradeoff process to make the award decision. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose proposal represents the Best Value after evaluation in accordance with the following Factors:</p>
<p>Factor I - Technical Approach</p>
<p>Factor II - Past Performance</p>
<p>Factor III - Price</p>
<p>(b) <strong>Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price Offeror; or, if non-price Factors are evaluated as comparatively equal between two or more Offerors, price may become a determinative factor.</strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>FACTORS AND THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE<br /><br /><br /></strong></p>
<p>(a) <strong>RELATIVE ORDER OF IMPORTANCE TERMINOLOGY.</strong>&nbsp; An evaluation of all offers will be made in accordance with the criteria set forth below.&nbsp; The evaluation criteria consists of Factors. In order to provide the Offeror with an understanding of the significance assigned by the Government, the Factors are assigned a relative order of importance.&nbsp; The following terminology is used:</p>
<p>(1) <strong>Significantly More Important.</strong>&nbsp; The Factor or Sub-factor is substantially more important than another Factor or Sub-factor.&nbsp; The Factor or Sub-factor is given far more consideration than another factor or sub-factor.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>More Important.</strong>&nbsp; The factor or sub-factor is greater in value than another factor, but not as much as a significantly more important factor or sub-factor.&nbsp; The factor or sub-factor is given more consideration than another factor or sub-factor.</p>
<p>(3) <strong>Equal.</strong>&nbsp; The factor or sub-factor is the same in value as another factor or sub-factor.<br /><br /><br />(b) <strong>RELATIVE ORDER OF IMPORTANCE OF FACTORS.</strong></p>
<p><br />(1) <strong>Factor Order of Importance</strong></p>
<p>a) The Technical Capability Factor is significantly more important than the Past Performance Factor.</p>
<p>b) The Past Performance Factor is More Important than the Price Factor.</p>
<p>c) All non-Price evaluation factors, when combined, are Significantly More Important than the Price Factor.<br /><br /><br /><strong>EVALUATION APPROACH</strong></p>
<p>All proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel.</p>
<p><strong>EVALUATION CRITERIA</strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>FACTOR I - Technical Approach</strong></p>
<p><br />The Government will evaluate the Offeror's technical approach on its quality, feasibility, practicability, innovativeness, and appropriateness in accomplishing the tasks and deliverables of this contract from a technical perspective.&nbsp; The Government will also evaluate the Offerors on the clarity of their approach and their ability to convey to the Government their understanding of and ability to perform the requirements of this SOW.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the suitability of an Offeror's proposed labor mix (labor categories and proposed hours) for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) to ensure that the Offeror understands the requirement. The Government will also evaluate the Quality Control Plan and the extent to which potential risks are identified and mitigated for all elements described in the SOW.</p>
<p>The Offeror shall address all requirements for the Technical Approach Factor and demonstrate the ability to meet or exceed the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>In order to provide the Offeror with an understanding of the value assigned by the Government, the criteria are being included below.&nbsp; From those single ratings, an overall rating will be determined.</p>
<p><br /><strong>The following adjectival rating scale / descriptions will be used to evaluate Factor I - Technical Approach.</strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>Outstanding -</strong> Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements.&nbsp; Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses.&nbsp; Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low.</p>
<p><strong>Good -</strong> Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements.&nbsp; Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptable -</strong> Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements.&nbsp; Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate.</p>
<p><strong>Marginal -</strong> Proposal does not clearly meet all requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements.&nbsp; The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths.&nbsp; Risk of unsuccessful performance is high.</p>
<p><strong>Unacceptable -</strong> Proposal does not meet all requirements and contains one or more deficiencies.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Evaluation of Proposal's Risk:</strong>&nbsp; The Government will consider risk in the evaluation of proposals.&nbsp; The following risk definitions will be used as general guidance in assessing the level of risk presented by each proposal.</p>
<p><br /><strong>LOW RISK -</strong> The Offeror's proposed solution presents little or no risk and is anticipated to have a minimal adverse impact on scope, schedule, cost, and/or contract performance. Normal Contractor effort and Government monitoring will mitigate potential difficulties. Minimum doubt exists that the Offeror can satisfactorily perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATE RISK -</strong> The Offeror's proposed solution presents some risk and is anticipated to have a moderate adverse impact on scope, schedule, cost, and/or contract performance. Special Contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will mitigate potential difficulties. Some doubt exists that the Offeror can satisfactorily perform the proposed effort.</p>
<p><strong>HIGH RISK -</strong> The Offeror's proposed solution presents significant risk and is anticipated to have significant adverse impact on scope, schedule, cost, and/or contract performance. Special Contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will not mitigate potential difficulties. Significant doubt exists that the Offeror can satisfactorily perform the proposed effort.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>FACTOR II - Past Performance</strong></p>
<p>Past Performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305.</p>
<p>The offer will be evaluated on the currency, size, scope, and responsibilities of the Offeror in engagements relevant to the requirements of this contract.&nbsp; In accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), Offerors without relevant Past Performance experience, or for whom information on Past Performance is not available, shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on Past Performance.<br /><br />The Government will evaluate Past Performance information submitted by the Offeror.&nbsp; The Government may also use references and other sources such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) when evaluating Past Performance.</p>
<p>Offerors will be evaluated on the extent and quality of their own corporate Past Performance (including that of established affiliates, subsidiaries, units or divisions of the Offeror's own company or parent company that are being proposed to support this effort).</p>
<p>As such, the Offeror's own corporate Past Performance (as a Prime Contractor) will be weighed significantly more heavily than the Offeror's experience as a Subcontractor.</p>
<p>After reviewing all recent and relevant Past Performance references, assessing the Offeror's quality of performance under those references, and considering all other sources of Past Performance data, the Government will use the adjectival ratings below to provide an overall Past Performance confidence assessment rating:<br /><br /><br /><strong>Substantial Confidence -</strong> Based on the Offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p><strong>Satisfactory Confidence -</strong> Based on the Offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Confidence -</strong> Based on the Offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p><strong>No Confidence -</strong> Based on the Offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a no expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown Confidence (Neutral) -</strong> No recent/relevant performance record is available or the Offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>FACTOR III - Price</strong></p>
<p>The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by evaluating prices for the Base Year and Option Years.&nbsp; Offers that do not include prices for the Option Years may be rejected and may not be considered further for award.&nbsp; Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the options.</p>
<p>The Price/Cost proposed will be evaluated, but not scored.&nbsp; The Contracting Officer and the Price Evaluation Team will use all methods available to evaluate the proposed prices. Price evaluation will commence upon final consensus ratings of the technical evaluation. The Contracting Officer (CO) and the Price Evaluation Team will review and evaluate the price proposals. The prices proposed will not be scored.&nbsp; Each Offeror's price/cost proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the proposal observes reasonableness and realism. As part of its evaluation, the Government will consider the labor rates for the Base Year and Option Years in the Offeror's proposed price/cost proposal.</p>
<p><br />Total price will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b)(2).&nbsp; The price evaluation may consider some or all of the following:</p>
<p>1. Comparison to other Offeror's proposals</p>
<p>2. Comparison to the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE)</p>
<p>3. Comparison to historical data</p>
<p><strong>No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.<br /></strong><br /><br /><br />(9.) All Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer.</p>
<p><br />(10.) FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, shall apply to this acquisition by reference-no addenda shall be attached.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Ombudsman Notice

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Program Manager is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division, reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, DC. OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division: Afghanistan/Pakistan (AF/PAK), Yemen, Eurasia and Asia (YEA), Middle East (ME), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). OTI's regional teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>The Program Manager's principal responsibility is to assist one of OTI's regional teams in the administration and management of existing country programs and participates in new country program assessments as the need arises. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of the time on country program implementation, and approximately 20% of the time on strategic planning and program development. The Program Manager must have a strong interest in assisting countries in transition and be able to accomplish a wide range of administrative functions (budget and financial preparation and management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change. The successful candidate will demonstrate sound judgment, excellent communication, interpersonal and analytical skills, and possess a well-developed understanding of US policy interests.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Program Manager is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>

<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division, in support of the Joint Program Executive Office - Chemical and Biological Defense, Joint Program Manager - Guardian Product Manager - Joint Force Protection Systems (JPdM-FPS) has a continued requirement for Integrated Commercial Intrusion Detection System Increment 5 (ICIDS V). ICIDS is a highly secure, standardized Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using state-of the-art commercial technology. ICIDS provides Commanders the means to detect and assess the unauthorized intrusion or attempted intrusion of protected areas. ICIDS is used by security and law enforcement agencies at Department of Defense (DoD) worldwide Installations providing a standard intrusion detection capability to protect critical facilities.    <br>      <br>  The ICIDS-V contract will be awarded as a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set aside to support promotion of socio-economic goals. The Government anticipates a single, six-year, Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a two-year base ordering period and four one-year optional ordering periods, with a ceiling of $99M.    <br>      <br>   The ICIDS-V acquisition approach is based on the use and integration of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. A single DO will be awarded for each Installation that includes site survey, site design, hardware and software acquisition and integration, fielding, Cybersecurity and Contractor Logistics Support (CLS). This acquisition will ensure the ICIDS-V systems fielded across all Installations are based on one integrated, Government-approved system configuration.    <br>

If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1339.270(a), insert the following provision: Electronic and Information Technology (APR 2010) (a) To be considered eligible for award, offerors must propose electronic and information technology (EIT) that meet the applicable Access Board accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194 designated below: ___ 1194.21 Software applications and operating systems ___ 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications ___ 1194.23 Telecommunications products ___ 1194.24 Video and multimedia products ___ 1194.25 Self-contained, closed products ___ 1194.26 Desktop and portable computers ___ 1194.31 Functional performance criteria ___ 1194.41 Information, documentation and support (b) The standards do not require the installation of specific accessibility-related software or the attachment of an assistive technology device, but merely require that the EIT be compatible with such software and devices so that it can be made accessible if so required by the agency in the future. (c) Alternatively, offerors may propose products and services that provide equivalent facilitation. Such offers will be considered to have met the provisions of the Access Board standards for the feature or components providing equivalent facilitation. If none of the offers that meet all applicable provisions of the standards could be accepted without imposing an undue burden on the agency or component, or if none of the offerors propose products or services that fully meet all of the applicable Access Board's provisions, those offerors whose products or services meet some of the applicable provisions will be considered eligible for award. Awards will not be made to an offeror meeting all or some of the applicable Access Board provisions if award would impose an undue burden upon the agency. (d) Offerors must submit representation information concerning their products by completing the VPAT template at http://www.Section508.gov . <BR> <BR>Insert clause 1352.239?72, Security Requirements for Information Technology Resources, in all DOC solicitations and contracts for Information Technology services.

<DESC>***NOTICE OF SOLE SOURCE REQUIREMENT***<br />The required software is necessary to allow for consistency and commonality among NSWCCD Code 7500 engineering design. Code 7500 currently maintains extensive part libraries designed using Solidworks's proprietary formats, which support the Division's underwater electromagnetic model and instrumentation design. Additionally, technical models are received from program sponsors and industry partners generated by, or are processed using, Solidworks's proprietary systems. Due to the existing libraries and use of this software across the division, the effort necessary to utilize different software would be cost prohibitive and would impact the fleet support operations &amp; program schedules. As such, this requirement is issued as a sole source to software manufacturer, Dassault Systems Solidworks Corporation; however, it may be competed among distributors.

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    <br>    <br>  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services, reference number W91236-15-T-0013,  prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) using Simplified Acquisition Procedures as authorized by FAR 13.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and an additional written solicitation will not be issued. PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE MADE AVAILABLE.    <br>    <br>   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-80 and DFARS Change Notice 26 February 2015. It is the responsibility of the contractor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions. The clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/ and http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dfars/index.htm. The successful offeror shall accept the binding order by written acceptance of the SF1449 prior to undertaking performance.  This RFQ is issued as a 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code is 561720, and the small business size standard is 18 million dollars. The Wage Determination applicable to this solicitation is 05-2543.  <br>      <br>  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement for janitorial services for military recruiting facilities throughout South Hampton Roads Virginia.  The contract resulting from this solicitation will cover the following locations:  <br>    <br>  Charlottesville - 920 Gardens Blvd, Suites 102-104, 22901  <br>  Staunton - 823 Richmond Avenue, 24401  <br>  Harrisonburg - 1645 Reservoir Street, #125 & #130, 22801  <br>  Winchester - 2113-2119 S Loudon Street, 22601  <br>  Culpeper - 771 Nalles Mill Road, 22701  <br>  Stafford - 1515 Stafford Market Place, 107/109, 22556  <br>  Fredericksburg - 1329 Alum Spring Road, 202, 22401  <br>    <br>  See the attached Bid Schedule and Location Detail documents for additional information regarding performance locations. Interested Offerors will have an opportunity to visit the above locations in order to assist in quote preparation from 18 - 27 March 2015 during regular business hours. Please see the attached Location Detail document for point of contact information.  <br>    <br>  The proposed contract contains provisions for a One (1) year Base Period with two (2) - 1 year Option Periods, and the contract is anticipated to start 1 April 2015.  However, the base year may start later than 1 April 2015 and may therefore have a base period of less than 1 year. If the base period is less than 1 year (12 months), pricing will be pro-rated.  The pro-rated price will be computed by multiplying the quoted unit price by the number of months remaining in the base period.  If the first month of the base period is for less than 30 days, the price for the first month will be prorated by dividing the monthly unit price by 30, and multiplying that number by the total number of days remaining in that month. The extended price for the base year will be adjusted accordingly.  <br>    <br>    <br>  EVALUATION OF QUOTES:  <br>    <br>  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation offers the lowest price.  <br>    <br>  Quote Submission Requirements   <br>    <br>  When submitting pricing for consideration, please provide a monthly rate and extended total for the Base Period and all applicable Option Periods on the Bid Schedule provided.  Offerors who failure to provide a completed bid schedule for the base and all option years will not be considered for award  <br>    <br>  Proposals submitted will be evaluated by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<a href="mailto:john.w.hynes2.civ@mail.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army, Army Contracting Command-New Jersey (ACC-NJ) in support of Project Manager Individual Weapons, is conducting a market survey to identify sources/vendors with experience in small arms manufacturing and associated technologies (corporate knowledge, technical expertise, facilities, manufacturing equipment, and product acceptance test hardware) capable of the production of the criteria noted below.  The Government is seeking to procure M4A1-Plus (abbreviated as M4A1+) components as Non-Development Items (NDI), for improvements to the M4A1 Carbine.  It is anticipated that the M4A1+ components will be evaluated as a system.  The system must then install on/interface with stock M4A1 Carbines.  The M4A1+ complies with U.S. Army guidance and the capability improvement strategy to field evolutionary capabilities to maintain threat overmatch, battlespace dominance, and mitigate capability gaps.  <br>    <br>  The M4A1+ components will seamlessly integrate with the current M4A1 Carbine (to include but not limited to the barrel, gas tube, upper receiver, bolt and bolt carrier) without negatively impacting or affecting the performance or operation of the M4A1 weapon. The M4A1+ components shall be compatible with current M4A1 ancillary equipment without modification to the ancillary equipment and/or the equipment's mounting brackets. This ancillary equipment includes but is not limited to optics/sights, aiming/pointing devices, training devices, slings, and rail covers.   <br>    <br>  REQUIREMENTS  <br>    <br>  The M4A1+ components shall provide a synergistic effect to enhance Soldier and weapon system lethality, survivability, and operational effectiveness. Specific M4A1+ attributes/capabilities are as follows:  <br>  a. Accuracy/Dispersion (Precision):  The system accuracy for the M4A1+ shall be 5 inches mean radius at 300 meters throughout barrel life (required) and shall be 5 inches extreme spread at 300 meters throughout barrel life with .9 probability (desired) and shall be 10 inches extreme spread at 600 meters throughout barrel life with.9 probability (desired).  Note:  The precision measurements are ammunition and M4A1+ specific, without attached under-barrel weapons.  Extreme spread measurements will be both vertical and horizontal.  <br>    <br>  b. Improved extended forward rails:  The improved extended forward rails shall provide for a MIL-STD-1913 compatible rail that is fixed at the 12 o'clock position, with numbered attachment points. The rail must also provide for the attachment of  modular, MIL-STD-1913 enabler(s) attaching capability on the hand guard.  The improved extended forward rails shall provide for a hand guard allowing for a free-floated barrel, and for a design/redesign of the under-barrel weapon systems/module interface to use the MIL-STD-1913 compatible rail surface on the hand guard as the attachment point(s), instead of the barrel.   <br>    <br>  i.	Length:  The length of the improved extended forward rails shall be twelve (+/- .5) inches.  <br>    <br>  ii.	Mounting surfaces:  The improved extended forward rails shall have sufficient removable mounting surfaces of varying lengths (e.g. 3 inches , 5 inches , 7 inches) to allow selective, simultaneous mounting of standard U.S. military accessories (e.g., lasers, illuminators, slings, bipods, vertical grips/grip-pods, etc.).   <br>    <br>  iii.	Zero Retention:  The improved extended forward rails mounting surfaces will allow for zeroed accessories/enablers to retain zero with 90% confidence (excluding optic/enabler malfunctions) no more than 1 Minute of Angle (MOA).  <br>    <br>  iv.	Color:  The improved extended forward rails shall provide for reduced visual detection via a neutral (non-black) color and shall be of a rough, dull, non-reflective, coating/finish that retains paint. The color range will be Coyote 498 not lighter than Light Coyote 481, IAW FED-STD-595 #20150 not lighter than #20220; flat dull finish.     <br>    <br>  v.	Protective Materials (coatings):  The improved extended forward rails shall be corrosion, abrasion, impact, as well as nuclear, biological, chemical (NBC) contaminants and decontaminants resistant.  The improved extended forward rails shall be protected from corrosion in all environments and weather conditions, including marine, high humidity, rain, and desert conditions.  <br>    <br>  vi.	Low Profile Gas Block:  The extended forward rails shall include a low profile gas block.  The gas block will be compatible with current M4A1 heavy barrel and gas tube.  <br>    <br>  vii.	Forward Sling Mount:  The extended forward rail shall include a forward sling mount compatible with 1 1/4 inch sling.    <br>    <br>  c. Improved back-up sights:  The M4A1+ shall include a removable back-up sight(s) to be used in the event of damage to the primary sight.  These back-up sights (front and rear) shall stow down/away to reduce interference with the mounted primary sights and flip up to enable Soldiers to engage targets out to 300 meters.  The sight aperture(s) shall provide for both near threat (to 200 m) and for longer (to 300m) engagements and shall allow for windage and elevation adjustments; 600 meters w/o degrading threshold capabilities.   <br>    <br>  d. Improved flash suppressor:  The M4A1+ shall incorporate a barrel flash suppressor / muzzle brake designed to reduce the day and night firing signature and night vision device blooming effect of the weapon to be less than the current carbine without loss in system performance.  The improved flash suppressor will have a blank firing adapter (BFA) compatible with M200 blank ammunition.  The BFA shall minimize injury if a live round is accidentally fired with the BFA attached.  <br>    <br>  e. Improved charging handle:  The improved charging handle shall provide for an enhanced (enlarged) grasping surface area that also allows for gas, lubricant, and debris deflection.  The charging handle design shall include an extended latch capability for improved hand/finger grasping access and enhanced operating leverage/operation for both left- and right-handed shooters.  The improved charging handle must be compatible with current standard optics, electro-optics and the improved BU sights (required).  .  <br>    <br>  f. Weapon Weight:  The M4A1+ will weigh  less than  8.0 pounds un-loaded without accessories/enablers.   <br>    <br>  g. Reliability:  The reliability of the M4A1+ shall be equal to or greater than the current capability when both systems are fired under the same conditions.    <br>    <br>  h. Enhanced trigger module:  The enhanced trigger module shall provide for a single-stage trigger, free of creep, with consistent trigger pull weight within the range of 4.0 to 5.0 pounds.  The enhanced trigger shall allow for operator selected semi-automatic and full automatic fire.  The trigger shall be capable of installation/replacement by the field level maintainer.  (Note:  Creep shall be interpreted to mean any perceptible rough movement between the time the trigger slack is taken up and the hammer is released). NOTE:  The enhanced trigger module is intended to be procured separately from all other M4A1+ components.  <br>    <br>  Production capacity estimates.  <br>    <br>  i. Request information on minimum and maximum monthly production rates for potential M4A1+ components, and the lead times to achieve these production rates.  This capacity should be above and beyond any of the vendor's current production orders or current sales.  If additional equipment is required to achieve maximum monthly production rates, so state.  <br>    <br>  VENDOR QUESTIONNAIRE  <br>    <br>  The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information from industry to assist in market research.

<DESC>This notice is being published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5.101(a)(1) requiring the dissemination of information on proposed contract actions. This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract, and is not a request for competitive proposals. The statutory authority for this sole-source procurement is 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.    <br>    <br>  The Army Contracting Command (ACC) intends to award a sole source contract to Augustine Consulting, Inc. (ACI) for a five year, Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee (CPFF), contract for software development, system integration, and production technical assistance services to support the Nett Warrior (NW) Acquisition Category (ACAT) II program.  ACI, as a support contractor to the Government, is the current NW software developer, software integrator / system integrator and software configuration manager for U.S. Army Product Manager Ground Soldier System (PdM GSS) NW program.  The products and services to be provided under this contract for the NW program include; software engineering; software coding; software configuration management; software development; software integration; software testing; software and hardware accreditation for secret use; NW specific system engineering, integration, testing; and NW related end user device and mission planning production software builds and software loading in support of NW production and fielding.    <br>    <br>  The NW is an ACAT II program that is different from typical Department of Defense (DoD) secret high weapons systems in that there is no prime contractor and NW is significantly impacted by Moore's Law due to NW's heavy reliance on commercial electronics.  The NW provides the dismounted leader with improved battlefield visibility through increased lethality, command, control, communications and information sharing across various echelons.  The integrated NW facilitates dynamic transmission of battlefield information and actively supports integration into the digitized battlefield.  The NW program utilizes components available from other Government agencies and commercial sources.  With this approach, the program minimizes the use of unique hardware and software and uses an open system architecture, which provides greater flexibility to incorporate technology upgrades, while reducing developmental and support costs.  PdM GSS plans to implement a strategy of yearly technology insertions into the NW program to leverage evolving mature technology and the significant investment of the ever changing commercial marketplace.  One of the benefits of the NW having no prime contractor (Government is the prime) is the ability to react quickly to integrating new technologies and software functionality (including 3rd party application integration) by leveraging Government contractor support for the majority of the program's supporting personnel.    <br>    <br>  The NW software, system integration and production software provisioning of End User Devices (currently Samsung Galaxy Note II) and NW Mission Planner (NMPs) computers is accomplished by ACI at the ACI run NW System Integration Lab (NW SIL), located in Eatontown, NJ which will continue under this contract.  The NW software includes Android Operating System (OS) modifications, stand-alone applications software developer kit (SDK), mission planning software and user applications that provide the Graphical User Interface (GUI), system controls, Situational Awareness/ Command & Control (SA/C2) user menus and functions such as mapping engine, position location calculations and digital message processing.  The NW also maintains Army Common Operating Environment (COE) compliance to the Mobile Handheld Computing Environment standards.    <br>    <br>  The NW, under this contract, will use the agile software development model, leverage mobile application development languages and tools and meet short capability release windows.  On a semi-annual basis, for the purposes of prioritizing / managing fixed levels of funding and schedule timelines, PdM GSS will re-prioritize the support contractor software development, integration, and post deployment software support efforts to proactively re-align with changing Army needs at the dismounted Soldier tactical environment.    <br>    <br>  NW integrates networking with self-contained data processing to provide the following functions, whose development, integration, testing, production, sustainment and management, will be executed under this contract:   <br>    <br>      (1)  Application Software.     <br>         a. NW has a software application suite that integrates all digital electronics components.  This includes a secure, certified computer operating system, graphical user interface, database, mapping and navigation, user authentication, and digital voice/data transmissions.  Software development is expected to be evolutionary, building more complex functionality once the basic software package is developed and tested.  The remaining NW core development effort is mainly adding in additional Variable Message Format (VMF) messages, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreement ( STANAG) messaging implementation, information assurance functionality, reducing password complexities by leveraging Near Field Communication (NFC) transports, integrating dual tunnel Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) into the EUD, completing initial release of the NW Software Developer Kit (SDK), integrating Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) transapps, migrating to new mapping engine (this is a recurring task every two years), expand Cursor-On-Target (COT) messages (tied to special force requirement), executing against Technical Transition Agreements (TTA) and Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs), improvements based on field feedback, support 3rd party software integration efforts (yearly activity),  establish compliance with Common Operating Environment (COE) 2.0, 3.0 and future baselines and correcting remaining Problem Change Reports (PCRs) level 3, 4 and 5 on V2.0.7 and subsequent baselines.  Software development support with expert knowledge in C, C++, C#, JAVA, Linux, .NET and Android focused on the development of products for the dismounted Soldier is required.  The contractor shall also be responsible to maintain NW software baselines that are currently in the field (2 NW baselines and 2 NMP baselines).  <br>           <br>         b. The NW system is designed to be interoperable with Army and Joint mission command systems.  Interoperable messages follow MIL STD 6017 and 6017A VMF with MIL STD 2045-47001C Connectionless Data Transfer Application Layer Standard.  The support contractor is required to be resident experts with these standards as well as future standards/formats required by COE.  <br>    <br>         c. The approximate amount of files and source code currently required to be managed and maintained under this procurement for NW applications are 7,212 files and approximately 1.1 million lines source code.  These numbers do not included any additional code required to support 3rd party application integration with NW which is part of the support services required under this procurement.  <br>       <br>      (2)  NW Software Developer Kit.  The NW developed and maintained NW SDK allows content providers to extend existing core capabilities, develop new capabilities while minimizing integration costs (i.e., following the Android SDK model).  The initial release of the NW SDK will occur in May 2015 and will include Application Programming Interfaces (API) for mapping services, and net services with full documentation and example programs.  The NW SDK will be updated on a yearly basis to keep pace with changes in mapping engines, GUI and net services functionality through the life of the NW program.  The approximate amount of files and source code currently required to be managed and maintained under this procurement for NW SDK are 2,374 files and approximately 394,000 lines of source code.  <br>           <br>     (3)  NW Tactical Marketplace.  The NW program started fielding in FY13, it requires a way to provide a scaled down version of an Army tactical-level software marketplace type capability by FY17 in a tactical level environment in line with the release of the NW SDK and associated NW V2.0.6 software drop and beyond.   The NW program, through this contract, is planning on establishing a NW tactical marketplace capability to provide a secure means for 3rd party applications to be vetted from an information assurance perspective (NW operates at the secret level) and from a NW interoperability and performance impact.  This NW tactical marketplace requirement has software, hardware and configuration management infrastructure requirements that are required to be refined, documented and implemented under this contract.    <br>    <br>     (4)  NW Mission Planner.   NW Mission Planner software (currently Windows 7 based), whose development, integration, testing, fielding and sustainment support under this procurement,  functionality includes: NW mission planning, monitor local SA/C2 traffic as a node on the network, create, modify, convert and load various map formats onto the EUD, gather NW system and security data logs, generate, and edit orders and overlays, add validated non-NW applications from multiple Army organizations onto the EUD, allow platoons to complete after action report/simulations and load UTO changes onto the EUD.  The approximate amount of files and source code currently required to be managed and maintained under this procurement for NW mission planner software are 694 files and approximately 84,000 lines of code.  <br>    <br>     (5)  Programming Description.  The Nett Warrior system software is a compilation of multiple Java applications running on an Android Operating System.  Nett Warrior uses the Android SDK and NW SDK to develop its application software.  Other software modules are written using C / C++ programming language.  The NW Mission Planning Tool, which is a Windows based support tool, uses the Microsoft Visual Studio with Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) subscription as well as the Government Off The Shelf (GOTS) mapping software package called Falconview.  The software environment development support tools are all commercial-based and include Eclipse, Subversion, Bugzilla and Dynamic Object Oriented Requirements (DOORs) Management.  The support contractor is required to be very familiar with these tools, operating systems, SDKs and software languages.  <br>    <br>     (6)  Software Development Environment.  The support contractor maintained NW software development environment is required to be unclassified but must also comply with information assurance requirements as specified by AR 25-2 and DoD 8500.1.  The NW SIL facility is required to be certified to handle up to at a minimum secret for both hardware and software since items returned from the field are considered secret.  The NW source code is required to be maintained by the support contractor in a physically secured and network protected server with a secondary backup server located off-site from the NW SIL.  Access to source code is limited to authorized personnel only.  All NW software developers, engineers, testers, and management support personnel are required to maintain a minimum of SECRET clearance to support NW program.   A few key employees are also required to have a TOP SECRET clearance in support of the NW program.   <br>    <br>     The support contractor within the software development environment is required to:  <br>         a.   Establish, maintain, and update source code repositories for NW SDK, NW application software, NW Android Operating System and kernel and NW Mission Planner Computer (MPC) application software;  <br>    <br>         b.

<DESC>CHANGE 6 - The following information are incorporated herein: <br>  <br> 1) The Government is intending to conduct a Pre-Solicitation Conference (as opposed to the previously planned Pre-Proposal Conference) and Site Visit to Germersheim, Gruenstadt and Coleman Barracks.  This Pre-Solicitation event is scheduled for Monday, 20 April 2015, from 0800 to 1500 HRS.   <br>  <br> 2) Interested firms are requested to submit names to mary.j.harding8.civ@mail.mil of no more than 3 representatives per company.  Also, please provide the Fuhrerschein # and Personalausweis # of each German National attendee or the  equivalent of these 2 picture ID cards if the individual is from a different European Union country.  If the attendee is a U.S. citizen or U.S. Permanent Resident, please provide the individual's Passport # (or Green Card #, if applicable) and U.S. Driver's License # and Issuing State.   <br>  <br> 3) The 0800 meeting location will be at either Gruenstadt or Germersheim (exact location to be provided on a forthcoming synopsis amendment).

I didn't see them in yesterday's post.  <br>    <br>  Answer:  Internally, the Government still has a few actions that have to take place before we can move forward with the issuance of the RFP and other milestone events.  So, more than likely, the Pre-Proposal Conference/Site Visit milestone will move to the right.    <br>    <br>  2) The weblink to the Annual OPSEC Awareness Training  <br>  required of contractor employees is:  http://cdsetrain.dtic.mil/opsec/.

Technical Capability - MOST important of the 3 technical evaluation factors  <br>  b. Management Capability - equal to Past Performance in importance  <br>  c. Past Performance - equal to Management Capability in importance  <br>    <br>  All 3 technical evaluation factors, when combined, are approximately equal in importance to cost or price proposed.  <br>     <br>  --- END OF CHANGE 5 ---  <br>    <br>    <br>  CHANGE 4 - Draft PWS attached herein.   <br>      <br>   --- END OF CHANGE 4 ---   <br>      <br>   CHANGE 3 - Revision to SSS of 23 FEB 2015 are as follows:    <br>        <br>    1) This will be a best value, negotiated procurement using Trade-off source selection procedures pursuant to FAR 15.     <br>        <br>    2) CLINs for the RFP will be as follows:    <br>        <br>    0001 O&M, Scheduled Inspections & Preventative Maintenance Services at Germersheim & Gruenstadt    <br>        <br>    0002 Service Orders for Scheduled Work (Hours between 0700 - 1600, Monday - Friday)    <br>        <br>    0003 Service Orders for Emergency Requirements (Hours between 1601 - 0659, Mon - Sun)    <br>        <br>    0004 Grounds Maintenance Services at Germersheim and Gruenstadt    <br>        <br>    0005 Snow and Ice Removal Services at Germersheim and Gruenstadt    <br>        <br>    0006 Individual Job Orders (IJOs) - Separately Approved/Awarded Orders for Within-Scope Work Valued at from 3001 to 50,000 Euros Per Order    <br>        <br>    0007 Purchase of Material to Support Contracted Services and Construction    <br>        <br>    0008 Facilities Operations & Maintenance Services, Minor Construction, Grounds Maintenance & Snow and Ice Removal Services at Coleman Barracks    <br>        <br>    0009 Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (CMRA) - Not Separately Priced (NSP)    <br>        <br>    3) Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) to be posted on FedBizOpps on 16 March 2015.    <br>        <br>    --- End of CHANGE 3 ---    <br>        <br>    CHANGE 2 - Additions to Sources Sought Synopsis of 03 FEB 2015 and CHANGE 1 posted on 04 FEB 2015, are as follows:     <br>          <br>    1) The proposed IDIQ will be for a base year; 2 option years thereafter; plus, a 6-month extension option invoked only upon the exercise of FAR clause 52.217-8.     <br>          <br>    2) Based on the capability statements received, this will be a best value, negotiated procurement using Lowest Price, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures pursuant to FAR 15.     <br>          <br>    3) Question from an Interested Firm:  I was hoping you might be able to confirm with me if the solicitation for the effort above remains anticipated to be released in February 2015?

Questions and answers:
03/19/2014
1.Can confirm per MIL-STD-129R and IAW ASTM D 4169 that each battery will need to be shipped in a box and each box will need a MIL-STD-129R sticker? This Local clause has been deleted and replaced with PACKAGING, HANDLING, STORAGE, AND TRANSPORTATION (PHS&T)
Packaging and marking will be in compliance with Hazardous Materials Regulations CFR 49 packing instructions 173.159.
and a copy of the revision for packaging is attached. (please see attached revised SIR), this instruction applies to all batteries.  

1.Freight:  Per your previously posted responses, vendor shall quote with shipping included in the unit price and the batteries will be shipped to various locations in the United States.
a.Question:  Not knowing the ship to locations, or the quantity of batteries being shipped, it is not practical to estimate shipping for these batteries without undue financial risk to a small business contractor or potentially overcharging the Government if estimates are too high.  Would the FAA consider changing solicitation to include a freight line item?  This would allow freight charges specific to the ship to location and the priority of the shipment (Priority 1 / Priority 2 / Priority 3).
b.Additionally, freight cost per battery is often much higher than a group shipment or pallet rate.  Often if multiple batteries are shipped it would be less than a freight cost bundled into the price of the battery.  Having an additional line item for freight would most likely save the Government considerable funding on freight? This has been changed to FOB Origin, freight is now PAID AT COST. THE COST OF SHIPPING WILL NOT BE EVALUATED AND SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE UNIT PRICE.    
2.If we are to ship include freight in the base battery pricing, can a listing of ship to locations be provided so we can have a basis for estimate? This has been changed to FOB Origin, freight is now PAID AT COST. THE COST OF SHIPPING WILL NOT BE EVALUATED AND SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE UNIT PRICE.    
3.What is the ILS system DC operating voltage (need to know how many batteries are used in each ILS system)? 2 batteries per system.  Typically runs at 27 volts, battery cut-off at 22.5 volts roughly.
4.How many batteries would typically be purchased on a single order (full string replacement or individual replacement batteries)?  Typically a full string replacement and is equipment dependent.  Some equip racks may only need 2 where others need 4.  Some sites may do all their systems at one time and could use 10, 20, etc.
5.What Manufacture and Model batteries are currently being used to support the ILS equipment across the United States?   Various units are used.  Some are from FAALC purchases, some on their own local procurements.  Many site techs will have a preference.
6.Can any taller batteries (higher than 10.1) be considered?  There are very few batteries that meet this height restriction but several that are still below 11 high.  No
7.Can detailed pictures of each type of installation be provided showing batteries, connections, enclosure/racking for existing systems?  General pictures could be provided, not readily available.  Most are two to a small rack or 4 to two racks.  Some sites still use fiberglass battery box with one or two sets contained within.
8.Are any connection cables/buss bars required or will existing connections be reused?  Existing will be reused with the exception of the bolt to be provided.
9.SOW 4.0 Warranty -  What is minimal acceptable warranty for this battery?  Typical manufacture warranty is 2-3 years full warranty with remainder prorated depending on application.  standard warranty that was in the Statement of Work (4.0).
10.Please describe the installation locations and conditions in which these batteries will reside and be maintained within.  Will they be in a conditioned environment (inside shelter with air conditioning / heating) or will they be in a below ground vault, or above ground cabinet, please provide detail?  I cannot speak for all installations.  The standard method is in a small shelter with the equipment.  Shelters are typically heated and cooled.  With the exception of when power goes out/ battery required.  Then, site & current weather dependent.
11.Part 1  Section F  Deliveries or Performance, F.2 Delivery Schedule.  Who specifies the number of units in this section, will this be specified on the delivery order?The different sites and and specifies on the delivery order. 
12.Part IV  Section L Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors  Are we allowed to submit pricing for more than one manufacture so the FAA can determine which best suits their requirements? Only one quote. 
13. Does the Buy American Act apply? YES

Request for offer DTFAAC-15-R-00758 is hereby attached along with the Statement of Work, Salient Characteristics, and FAA Specification FAA-E-2826. 

TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE

<p>_________________________________<br /><br />DRAFT&nbsp;Statement of Work: <br />Consumer Health Information on Herbs and Supplements <br />National Library of Medicine</p>
<p>1. Background<br />To assist consumers in obtaining the information they need to make informed decisions about health care, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) has developed MedlinePlus (medlineplus.gov), an easily understandable Web resource for the public. MedlinePlus contains and links to information from authoritative health Web sites and content providers, especially those from the National Institutes of Health. NLM makes MedlinePlus available to the public through a variety of MedlinePlus-branded Web sites, Web services, Web applications, APIs, email and social media communications, XML files and search results.</p>
<p>This Statement of Work (SOW) addresses NLM's need to license herbal and dietary supplement information in English and Spanish for MedlinePlus.</p>
<p>2. Objective <br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM) requires unique authoritative herbal and dietary supplement information for inclusion in the MedlinePlus full and mobile web sites (http://medlineplus.gov and http://m.medlineplus.gov), both of which include information in both English and Spanish. The herbal and dietary supplement information will be an important resource for consumers, and will augment the information already provided on MedlinePlus. NLM will host the content on its own servers. Content will be displayed in MedlinePlus templates with attribution to the content provider. Links to the content may also be included in email updates and Twitter posts sent from the National Library of Medicine to interested users.</p>
<p>The Vendor shall provide us with the data (at no cost) or a sample set of the data and a complete list of available units (at no cost) within a week after the award is made for our internal planning purposes. If the vendor is willing to provide the data while we are negotiating the license agreement that would be a benefit to the government and we would welcome that. The vendor will be available for questions regarding the data and implementation on MedlinePlus, MedlinePlus en espa&ntilde;ol, and MedlinePlus Mobile during the time period before the base year starts. This will facilitate our programming and testing time before we make the content available on the site. Once the base year officially starts, which is when the data will be publically available on the site, we will pay for the base year as planned.</p>
<p>3. Mandatory Requirements<br />a. Authoritative content: The content must be accurate and authoritative. The authorship of the content must be identified. The medical advisory board of the health content must be provided via the web. Content should be based on peer-reviewed evidence and contain references to the evidence. <br />b. Audience: The content must be written for the general layperson. The content must be consumer-friendly and written at a consumer reading level.<br />c. Equivalent content in English and Spanish: The content of the monographs must be completely equivalent in English and Spanish. The content must be structured in such a way that NLM can map from information in one language to the other. <br />d. Regular updating of content: Content must be current, and reviewed and updated at least yearly. Content updates must be accompanied by detailed documentation of the changes that have been made to the content. Documentation must include a list of information that has been added, edited, or deleted.<br />e. Emergency updating of content: There must be a provision for updating and/or replacing inaccurate or outdated content outside the regular update schedule if requested by NLM or deemed necessary by changes in the health environment.<br />f. No commercial content: Information must be free of commercial endorsements or advertisements. <br />g. Unobtrusive co-branding: Branding by the content provider must be minimal and unobtrusive.<br />h. No registration: Users must be able to access all content licensed by NLM without having to register with the content provider.<br />i. Format of content: Content must be delivered to NLM in a desired format, such as well-formed XML with accompanying DTD or schema. NLM seeks text-based, descriptive information about supplements. <br />j. Accessibility of content: Content must be accessible in accordance with Section 508 (29 U.S.C. 794d). It is the responsibility of the content provider to familiarize themselves with Section 508 requirements and ensure that their content meets these requirements. <br />k. NLM prefers content should provide graded scales of effectiveness for remedies. <br />l. NLM prefers having high-quality drawings or photographs that accompany the information.</p>
<p>5. Specific Technical Requirements<br />a. Files must be customizable to be integrated into the MedlinePlus environment. The content must be delivered in well-formed XML. NLM will use the XML to:<br />i. index content for its search engine. <br />ii. provide users with a printer-friendly version of the individual content pages. The content provider does not need to provide this formatting. NLM can create this formatting.<br />iii. provide users with the ability to email the individual content pages to other users. The content provider does not need to provide the service. NLM may implement this with a custom solution. <br />b. NLM will implement links to social networking sites and other online sharing forums from the individual content pages to allow MedlinePlus users to easily share content of interest within their social networks. The links will be implemented through a custom solution or through a third party such as AddThis.com.</p>
<p>4.1 Accessibility Requirements<br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that Federal agencies' information and communication technology is accessible to people with disabilities. The herbal and supplement content offered must be Section 508 compliant. Specifically, the end product must be conformant with all applicable provisions, including:</p>
<p>1194.22 Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications.<br />1194.31 Functional Performance Criteria<br />1194.41 Information, documentation, and support.</p>
<p>Applicable clauses depend on the nature of the content. These provisions can be found at the U.S. Access Board Guidelines and Standards.</p>
<p>Updates to Section 508 guidelines are currently under revision. The Offeror will be expected to comply with revised section 508 standards within a reasonable timeframe once these new accessibility guidelines are issued.</p>
<p>In addition, the Offeror should provide Level AA conformance to the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative (W3C-WAI) WCAG 2.0 standards when possible since they will likely soon be required by law under the update. Conformance includes ensuring that all content, including text, all non-text content such as multimedia and images, and any associated players or viewers, are fully accessible per Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards. The idea is to provide as close an equivalent experience as possible for all users. This includes but is not limited to ensuring every page is fully keyboard-navigable; that any and all prompts for user interaction are keyboard accessible; that controls for the media player are fully accessible and properly labeled; that all text elements are captioned and synchronized with the content and that all non-text elements are fully described, including any images, still or moving, that provide context as to the meaning of the content; and that multimedia does not auto-start on page load.</p>
<p>4.2 Accessibility Program Need<br />Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) are determined to be relevant for the following program need: "Information on Herbs and Supplements for MedlinePlus."<br />4.3 Accessibility Product Requirements <br />1194.22, 1194.31 and 1194.41 from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart D have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how Information and Communication Technology deliverables meet at least these requirements identified as applicable in the attached Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).</p>
<p>4.4 Accessibility Evaluation Factors <br />Responses to this solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the proposal adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508. Only proposals which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the accessibility requirements (e.g. a completed GPAT) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration.</p>
<p>If the deliverable proposed in response to this solicitation includes features and functions in addition to those identified as requirements, these features and functions also need to conform to relevant Section 508 technical provisions, functional performance criteria, and information, documentation and support. The accessibility of these additional features and functions should be described in the completed GPAT.</p>
<p>4.5 Accessibility Acceptance Criteria <br />The herbal and dietary supplement information licensed as a result of this solicitation will be accepted based in part on satisfaction of identified requirements for accessibility. The Offeror must include a completed GPAT, a sample of which is included as a part of this solicitation. The Offeror should complete the two right-hand columns, including an explanation of how the product complies with the clause.</p>
<p>If the deliverable includes features and functions in addition to those identified as requirements, these features and functions also need to conform to relevant accessibility technical provisions, functional performance criteria, and information, documentation and support.</p>
<p><br />6. Contract Type <br />Anticipated Contract Type: Firm Fixed Price</p>
<p>7. Place of Performance<br />Files will be delivered or retrieved electronically.</p>
<p><br />8. Period of Performance<br />There will be a base year, plus four option years.</p>

Deliverables/Delivery Schedule<br />SOW TASK # Deliverable Title #Calendar Days After Award<br />Regular Content Update At a mutually agreeable schedule <br />Initial Content File Delivery 14 days after award<br />Response to User Feedback provided by NLM At a mutually agreeable schedule, preferably monthly<br />Response to requests for emergency updating of content Within a mutually agreeable turn-around time</p>
<p><br />10. Inspection and Acceptance Criteria <br />NLM will inspect and do a quality review of the delivered content as part of the regular update process.</p>
<p>14. Transition Plan <br />The awardee will be required to provide NLM with technical support and advanced delivery of the content files within 1 week of being selected by NLM so that NLM can plan for the implementation of the content pages and links to these pages on MedlinePlus-branded sites, services and files.</p>
<p>In the event that NLM ceases licensing this product, the Offeror will be notified within 30 calendar days of the change, but will help assist with the transition by providing technical support and addressing questions that facilitate transitioning to a new provider of content. The contractor shall create any requested non-proprietary documentation that NLM requests to aid with the transition. Any documentation developed for this purpose shall be the property of the government.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey Leetown Science Center (LSC) has a need to renovate and retrofit an existing wet laboratory to develop and install standard operating procedure items for a Biosafety Level 3 Aquaculture Equivalent Laboratory (BSL-3 Aquaculture Lab).  The lab is located in Kearneysville, West Virginia.

A partial list of requirements includes:  1) Develop and install three anterooms, the first providing access into the Primary Hygiene area and two additional anterooms, one leading into the high containment laboratory and the other leading into the waste water treatment room associated with the high containment laboratory.  These anterooms will aid in the creation of rooms with increasingly negative pressure moving from outside the BSL-3 Lab into the high containment laboratory; 2) Move the air supply from the 15 ton AHU to the 25 ton AHU to feed the three anterooms and the water treatment room3. Install some new duct work above the anterooms to be constructed as part of this SOW; 4) Develop and install a HEPA filter system to existing exhaust system (at least 9 exhausts); 5) Develop a bioseal for the set of double doors that lead directly into the high containment laboratory from an adjacent wet lab that can be broken and resealed after bringing in additional large tanks for fish and other aquatic species research. 6). Tie in two existing Aaon units into the existing building controls.
All interested firms may submit a response by March 18, 2015 demonstrating their capabilities and experience to perform the requested service to the primary contact below.  Interested firms should have prior experience in design and construction of high containment, Biosafety Level 3 and/or Biosafety Level 4 Laboratories. Design and construction of hospital laboratories is insufficient.

Firms responding should indicate their socioeconomic status (e.g. small business, service disabled veteran, woman/women owned, HUBZone, etc.).  The Governments evaluation of the capabilities of respondents will factor into whether the forthcoming solicitation will be conducted using full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses or small business designation.  This requirement is expected to result in the award of a firm-fixed price contract.

The estimated magnitude of construction is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.

The NAICS code is 236220.  The size standard is $36.5 million.

Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary.  This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in responses to this notice.  Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments.

<DESC> <br>  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS; NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS SPECIAL NOTICE.  <br>    <br>  The purpose of this notification is to obtain industry feedback with regards to binding pricing for the SAD Multiple Award Task Order Contract for Operational and Maintenance Dredging.  <br>    <br>  Rationale for this notice:  <br>    <br>  The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), and specifically 10 USC   2305(a)(3)(A)(ii), requires that  quote mark cost or price to the Federal Government as an evaluation factor ... must be considered in the evaluation of proposals. quote mark  See also, FAR 15.304(b)(1).  In general, GAO has interpreted this provision in the context of IDIQ contracts to require that cost or price receive meaningful consideration and that the evaluation scheme must provide some reasonable basis for evaluating or comparing the relative costs of offerors' proposals.  Pricing that is only receiving nominal consideration, such as in a subsequent task order competition, would be inconsistent with CICA and cannot serve as a reasonable basis for award. The MIL Corporation, B-294836, Dec. 30, 2004, 2005 CPD  29.  Meaningful consideration of cost or price in an IDIQ also requires binding prices.  See generally, CW Carlson Wagonlit Government Travel Inc.-Reconsideration, B-295530.2, July 25, 2005, 2005 CPD   139.  However, binding prices alone are not sufficient.  Those prices must also accurately reflect an Agency's past or projected needs and take into account the amount that each binding price or rate is likely to be used. See, e.g., SJ Thomas Co., Inc., B-283192, Oct. 20, 1999, 99-2 CPD   73.  <br>    <br>  As a threshold matter, even when price is the least important factor for award, the agency must meaningfully consider it.  In The MIL Corporation case, when the Agency performed its source selection, it minimized the potential impact of price and effectively made price meaningless as a comparative evaluation factor.  Specifically, the source selection for the basic contract awards was limited to reviewing prices proposed as reasonable and realistic, even while explicitly stating that price considerations were very important in the award of individual task orders.  In failing to consider the differences among the offerors' proposed pricing-notwithstanding the Agency's evaluation of those technical differences - the Agency abandoned the solicitation's evaluation scheme and violated the legal requirement that price be given meaningful consideration as an evaluation factor for award.    <br>    <br>  Thus, an assertion that competition among contractors at the task order level will be considered sufficient pricing is not acceptable to the GAO.   quote mark The statutory requirement that cost to the government be considered in the evaluation and selection of proposals for award is not satisfied by the promise that cost or price will be considered later, during the award of individual task orders. quote mark  CW Government Travel Inc.-Reconsideration, B-295530.2, July 25, 2005, 2005 CPD   139.   quote mark [T]here is no exception to the requirement set forth in CICA that cost or price to the government be considered in selecting proposals for award because the selected awardees will be provided the opportunity to compete for task orders under the awarded contracts. quote mark  The MIL Corporation, B- 294836, Dec. 30, 2004, 2005 CPD  29.  See also Serco, Inc. v. United States, 81 Fed. Cl. 463, 493, (2008), (rejecting the Government's task order competition argument and finding that the agency  quote mark gave price neither the weight it was entitled to under the solicitation nor that which it must be afforded under CICA and the FAR quote mark ).  The Agency may not substitute competition at the task order level for compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.   <br>    <br>  Included with this notice:  <br>    <br>  Two spreadsheets are included with this synopsis.   <br>    <br>  The first spreadsheet is the concept in which the Jacksonville District anticipates acquiring binding pricing for the Dredging MATOC. The unit prices will be binding within the base contract, and binding prices must be utilized in preparing task order proposals.   <br>    <br>  The second spreadsheet is an example of how the spreadsheets would be utilized for a task order proposal. Within this spreadsheet, there is a tab labeled assumptions. This tab helps to explain how the equipment was selected for the example.   <br>    <br>  How the Government intends to utilize binding pricing:  <br>    <br>  The Government intends for offerors to submit binding prices with the base contract proposal for each line item listed within the worksheets included. If an offeror does not possess the equipment listed, or the labor item listed for a particular dredge, that line item will be left blank. Prices must be evaluated for all years of the contract, so offerors would be required to submit binding prices for each worksheet for the base year and each of the four option years.  <br>    <br>  Along with the base contract proposal will be sample task orders that will be representative of the work to be performed under each MATOC pool. The prices submitted for the sample task orders as well as the unit prices for all items listed within the MATOC worksheets will be evaluated for reasonableness.   <br>    <br>  After award of the base contracts within each MATOC Pool, the Government will compete task orders amongst the parties in each pool. Offerors proposals will include the worksheets for each task order to support the prices proposed for each line item within the bid schedule that contain binding pricing within the base contract. An offeror must utilize the worksheets to support their prices for items within the bid schedule. An offeror is allowed to propose lower unit prices than those listed within their base contract, but are forbidden from offering unit prices higher than those listed within the offerors base contract. Offerors proposals will be evaluated to ensure that they utilized the prices, or lower prices, than those listed within the base contract for each item that contains binding pricing in the base contract. Once offerors proposals have been verified to have used the pricing schedules from the base contract, an award will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror for each task order.  <br>    <br>  At the time of task order award, the worksheet information will drop off from the award document. A task order award will look exactly like the bid schedule. This will ensure that offerors binding prices contained within their base contract are protected from release.  <br>    <br>  Response Instructions:  <br>    <br>  If you are interested in participating in this procurement please respond to this Special Notice.  Your response should include:   <br>    <br>  1.	Suggestions to improve the method of obtaining binding pricing at the base contract level for a MATOC for maintenance dredging.  <br>  2.	Concerns about binding pricing and the impacts they would have in the marketplace and or against competition for the base contract.  <br>  3.	Concerns about binding pricing and the impacts they would have in the marketplace and or against competition for each task order.  <br>  4.	Any questions you have regarding binding pricing as it relates to the proposed acquisition.  <br>    <br>  Responses to this Special Notice must be received not later than 6 April 2015 and shall be sent to the attention of Mr. John Vohlken via e-mail to john.d.vohlken@usace.army.mil.  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPRIETARY AND/OR BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL DATA.    <br>    <br>  A teleconference will be held on Monday, March 23, 2015 at 2:00 P.M.

<AWDNBR>AG-32SB-C-15-0002
<AWDDATE>032515
<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS, Office of Chief Information Officer (OCIO), intends to award a sole-source contract to Iconsoft, Inc. for expertise to support and maintain the new ARS Intranet Axon which includes maintenance of a very customized set of web parts and functionality, continued configurations for fine tuning of current server farm including adding additional servers, upgrades to SharePoint software and services, consolidating Microsoft Office and other document editing capabilities throughout the platform, implementation of alerts, subscriptions, content management, future migration to cloud services as well as many other very customized enhancements. The contractor shall also provide development leveraging third party tools to incorporate additional workflows and development of enhancements and functionality per requirements in support of Axon. <br /><br />The contractor will also provide SharePoint and web application administration services for the following existing systems which could include migration to new technologies: Your Two Cents, Cultural Transformation, REE Directory, and Customized ARS Scientific collaboration sites. The knowledge and experience with these applications will enable a timely, smooth transition to new technologies.<br /><br />These services are unique because the Agricultural Research Service's new Intranet, Axon system is a uniquely customized SharePoint system that has been in production less than a year and is currently in the stages of Phase 2. For a transition that does not cause the Government harm, both financially and to the already developed system, and for the need of a very specific technical skill set that is required to complete the Phase 2 we rationalize the justification for this contractor. <br /><br />This contractor has been with the agency since the design phase as well as through the development and implementation of the Axon system. Because of the lack of ARS resources this contractor is the sole developer of Axon and there is no resources to train another contractor. It would take months if not longer to bring another contractor up to speed reviewing the system and its customization and would jeopardize the progress on multiple projects costing thousands of dollars in a current tight budgetary time. This contractor also has the knowledge and expertise of other ARS customized web applications that will require migration to other technologies that will enable a smooth and timely transition. Another contractor would also have to learn about these other applications causing valuable time and resources that are needed elsewhere. <br /><br />The Axon system is now the primary communication tool for the Agency. Management requests for increased functionality as well as content management customization needs are numerous. One example: Without the content management customization needed the agency's Axon editor who is the sole content manager cannot effectively update and manage the 37 current sites. Sites include policies and procedures, ARS All announcements, and information that is now distributed entirely through Axon. Another example is the completion of application migration to new technologies that must be completed by the expiration of the older technology or functionality incorporated into software for e-Authentication needed by deadlines of waivers.
<p><br />The Statue Authority for this is in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(B) (B) Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the services are unique and highly specialized. Also FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) (ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --<br /><br />(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or<br /><br />(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 3304 (b)(2)) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)</p>
<p><br /><strong>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.</strong> This notice is for informational purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Vendors that believe they can provide the services listed above are invited to submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact.</p>
