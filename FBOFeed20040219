This project involves the remodeling of 5 rooms on the 6th floor which will add two rooms to those available to conduct sleep studies.  In the plan for FY 04, we seek to divide Room 6E07 into two rooms that would be redesigned as sleep laboratory rooms.  Room 6E08 would be remodeled into a patient room and 6E02, a larger room, would be converted into a control room.  In addtional to its size, which accomaodates its use as a control room, Room 6E02 already has an adjacent bathroom that would be available to the technologists without their having to leave the proximity of their patients.  Room 6E02 also is adjacent to the proposed sleep patient rooms and thus allows for closer observation and monitoring.  On the 9th floor, the work includes remodeling rooms of the west wing to provide offices for psychiatic consultation.  Estimated construction cost range is between $500,00 to $1,000,000.  The area of consideration within a (150) mile radius of this facility.

<DESC>The Maritime Administration is announcing the National Defense Tank Vessel Construction Program established in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (H.R.1588). The program provides for financial assistance for construction in the United States of a fleet of up to 5 privately owned product tank vessels to be operated in commercial service in foreign commerce and to be available for national defense purposes in time of war or national emergency pursuant to an Emergency Preparedness Plan approved by the Secretary of Defense.  Although MARAD may employ procedures borrowed from the Federal Acquisition Regulation System to administer the National Defense Tank Vessel Construction Program (NDTVC), it is intended instead that MARAD would enter into a cooperative agreement with the shipyard and ship operator.  MARAD has determined that an acquisitions contract is not the appropriate funding vehicle because the United States government is not procuring either property or services.  Instead, we intend to use a cooperative agreement, because the award of tank vessel construction assistance serves the public purpose of fostering a modern and necessary U.S. merchant marine supported by efficient facilities for shipbuilding and ship repair.  The RFP and all future information regarding this program may be found at the MARAD website at http://www.marad.dot.gov/.  For further information contact Greg Sparkman at 202-366-2400.

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Southwestern Region, Apache—Sitgreaves National Forests, Springerville, Arizona, is announcing a Request For Proposals (RFP) for Performance Based Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Service Contract that provides the Government with an end-result project that significantly reduces the fuels in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) areas surrounding National Forests.  The Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests comprise a significant portion of the largest contiguous Ponderosa Pine forests in North America.  Fire suppression efforts over the last hundred years has generated a breeding ground for very dense forests that were once characterized by 20-60 trees per acres, which now range from 300 to 3000 trees per acre.  This dramatic increase in fuel load per acre has resulted in forest conditions that are unstable and make the forests vulnerable to intense wildfires.  Biomass Management treatments are sought over a ten-year period to effect a landscape treatment that promotes a “healthier forest” by dramatically reducing the intensity of wildfire within the WUI.  To maximize efficiency of operation, this RFP is being offered under the Stewardship Authority granted in Public Law 108-7.  Stewardship authority allows for the treatment of small diameter residue (non-merchantable trees and slash) to be offset by the value of forest products authorized to be removed.  The Performance Based Service Contract (PBSC) approach allows offerors to propose a variety of methods and applications to efficiently produce the quality end results.  The Government anticipates awarding a Performance Based Service Contract (PBSC) with a Firm Fixed-Price for small diameter tree and slash removal; and a rate re-determination on the value of sawtimber over the life of the contract.  Award will be based on the successful offeror’s proposal that provides the best value to the Government with consideration given to past performance, submittal documentation to satisfy evaluation factors, and methods proposed to accomplish the work.  Market research has determined that the scope of this project is beyond the capability of small businesses.  However, the Government has included a requirement in RFP for offerors to comply with the small business sub-contracting plan.  The Small Business size standard is $5.0 Million under NAICS code 115310.  Pre-Proposal / Site Visits will be scheduled and announced in the RFP.  The Government anticipates conducting three separate site visits that will be representative of the level of effort required for Biomass Management on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests.  Attendance for the Pre-Proposal Meetings / Site visits is strongly encouraged, but not required.  Costs associated with the preparation of proposals and/or site visits are the sole responsibility of the offerors/parties to the procurement process.  The proposal package, maps, and specifications will be made available on or after March 3, 2004, and will be posted at (except maps and drawings – these must be requested in writing) http://www.fedbizopps.gov.   In order to be eligible for award of a Federal contract, Offerors must now be registered in the Central Contractor Registration System (CCR).  The template containing information necessary for registration can be found at  http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.  The Contracting Officer is Richard Salazar, Southwestern Region 3, Acquisition Management Director, Albuquerque, New Mexico.  No Telephone requests for proposal packages will be accepted.  You may request a printed copy of the proposal package by submitting the request by Fax to: (928) 333-6357 (or 6362).    The last day to request proposal packages shall be May 3, 2004.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number RFQ-04-033 is issued as a request for quotation. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-18. The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541990 and the size standard is $6.0 Million. The Inter-American Foundation, through the Bureau of Public Debt, has a requirement for a Local Development Financing Fund.  There has been a tremendous increase in amounts and types of funding available to large micro-credit organizations—outfits providing small, short-term loans generally neither accompanied by technical assistance nor part of larger development or community-based plans.  There are other non-governmental organizations, however, that provide loans to social and micro-enterprises as a component of comprehensive development strategies.  Such organizations, while often more effective participants in the development process, cannot gain access to higher levels of loan funding on advantageous terms.  While the IAF has statutory authority to make loans, it has never done so and lacks the administrative infrastructure to do so now.  Accordingly, the IAF plans to partner with an organization (the Operating Partner) that has a history of successful community-level development loan funding in Latin America and the Caribbean.  The IAF will work with the Operating Partner to create a facility (the Facility) to provide loans to selected organizations (Eligible Institutions, or EIs).  The Facility would primarily fund EIs in Central America, but could also be active in other parts of the region.  Further, the IAF plans to arrange the partnership in such a way as to attract and facilitate the participation of other donors, including possibly offering attractive options for more risk-averse funders.  This arrangement would, in addition to creating enormous leverage and supporting programs worthwhile in their own right, significantly lower IAF costs, develop multiple tiers of participation on the part of donors and investors, and bring the local poor into banking systems.  The IAF envisions entering a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the selected Operating Partner.  The MOU will cover the broad objectives of collaboration and the geographic areas where the pilot effort would occur.  The IAF and the Operating Partner would then enter a cooperative agreement providing $100,000 to $500,000 to initiate operations in a particular country or countries.  The IAF seeks a contractor (the Contractor) to find and evaluate a potential Operating Partner and potential donors, and negotiate the terms of the partnership agreement for this pilot project.  The objectives of the project are to:  1) Define the scope of operation of the Facility, 2) Identify the Operating Partner, 3) Define the type of financing and structure of the Facility, 4) Identify other funders, and 5) Negotiate and document the Facility.   Methodology:  The project will proceed in five phases.  Phase 1: The Contractor will define the types of EIs eligible for receiving loans from the Facility. These parameters should exclude any organizations that have adequate sources of capital and those that are too small and are not ready for loans from the Facility.  The IAF plans to focus the work of the Facility in Central America, with a view toward expanding to other parts of Latin America if the pilot project is successful.   Phase 2:  The IAF has identified a potentially attractive Operating Partner to manage the Facility.  The Contractor will conduct research on this potential Operating Partner in order to determine whether it is appropriate.  This research will include at least the following: Reputation of the organization and its founders, their ethical standards and the source of their capital; Capacity to manage the Facility; Criteria for choosing EIs to receive loans and their willingness to adapt their standards to IAF requirements; Criteria for selecting credit recipients, including development and business criteria; Credit approval process; and Policy for dealing with bad loans and capacity to take action in the event of default.  

If this potential Operating Partner proves not to be a suitable choice, the Contractor will work with the IAF to identify and evaluate another candidate.  Phase 3:  The Contractor will define the structure and type of financing the Facility will use. The Contractor will also work with the IAF and other funders to define their role in the Facility.  Phase 4:  
The Contractor will design a number of different ways in which potential funders can participate in the Facility.  The design could include some risk protection from the IAF to entice more risk-averse entities or individuals to participate.  The Contractor will prepare a presentation for potential funders, and will seek funders whose objectives match with the goals of this IAF-sponsored Facility.  The Contractor will work with the IAF to contact these potential funders to determine their interest in the Facility.  The Contractor will negotiate and prepare agreements with any interested funders.   Phase 5:  The Contractor will work with the IAF to negotiate a final agreement with the Operating Partner and other funders.  The Contractor will also work with the IAF to prepare the documents needed to finalize the agreements with the Operating Partner and other funders, and help the IAF to finalize the Facility through a cooperative agreement.  
Deliverables-Phase 1. The Contractor will provide a written report that defines the types of EIs which should be eligible for receiving loans and key criteria for selecting those EIs, including development and financial criteria.  Phase 2. The Contractor will report on results of research into the suitability of the potential Operating Partner.  If the potential Operating Partner is not suitable for the purposes of this project then the Contractor will conduct a search for another potential Operating Partner to manage the Facility.  The Contractor will then report findings and recommendations to the IAF.   Phase 3.  The Contractor will produce a report analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the possible structures of the Facility.  The Contractor will work with the IAF to decide on the best option.  The Contractor will negotiate an MOU with the Operating Partner reflecting the appropriate structure.  Phase 4. The Contractor will prepare a report on different ways in which potential funders can participate in the Facility.  The Contractor will prepare a presentation for potential funders in cooperation with the IAF.  The Contractor will develop a list of potential funders, work with the IAF to develop relationships with those funders, and negotiate agreements with those that are interested in contributing to the Facility.  Phase 5. The Contractor will prepare the documents needed to finalize the necessary agreements with the Operating Partner and other funders, and help the IAF to finalize the Facility through the MOU and a cooperative agreement.

<DESC>The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), intends to award a sole source purchase order to Kastle Systems, LLC 150 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia, to continue providing security coverage to the interior control access points at the  810th 7th Street, NW and the 800 K Street, NW building sites located  in Washington, D.C. Kastle currently provides security throughout both facilities seven days a week with twenty-four hour coverages related to monitoring, services calls, repairs, and customer service.  OJP has the ability, with Kastle Systems’s satellite computer, to control Kastle access cards and to make and delete entries necessary for OJP to cover its security needs.  It is recommended that OJP retain its current contractor and security systems because it would not be cost effective to completely remove Kastle’s security system and replace it with another system.  Only One Responsible Source with Unique Capabilities.  This is not a request for quotations.  Any interested firms may submit their technical capabilities.

<DESC>The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), National Institute of Justice (NIJ) attends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to the University of North Carolina (UNC), 101 Conner Drive, Suite 302, Chapel Hill, NC,  to do an analysis of data on the subject “ The Recidivism Rate of Mentally Ill Offenders”.   UNC will do an analysis of existing data sets from Pinellas County, FL and King County, WA to investigate the patterns of re-arrest and re-incarceration to jail of persons with a serious and  persistent mental illness (SMI) who have Medicaid benefits upon release from an earlier jail stay.  The analysis will cover the period 1998-2000 in Pinellas County and 1997-1998 in King County. A case-control research design will be employed with cases defined as persons with SMI who leave jail on Medicaid during the defined study period in each county and controls as persons with SMI who leave jail without Medicaid during the defined study period.  Dr. Morrissery and his associates at UNC  have collected this information during an ongoing research project funded by NIMH.  This is the only data NIJ has been able to locate to address the specific question of recidivism among mentally ill offenders who do or do not receive Federal benefit.  This is not a request for quotation.  Interested parties should submit their proposals.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Reference sources sought synopsis dated February 13, 2004.  This solicitation is for the Coupling Half, Quick Disconnect (CHQD), NSN: 4730-01-391-8461, P/N: 5-1-1086.  The government intends to issue a Best Value solicitation for an estimated quantit y of 1-1.4M each.  However, because the items are urgently needed the government intends to solicit with a very compressed delivery schedule.  The evaluation will be a Trade Off Analysis in which price will not be the most important factor.  The government  requires deliveries at a rate of 175,000 to 350,000 per month.  In order to meet the required monthly rate, the government may make more than one contract award.  A First Article Test (FAT) is required 60 days after contract award.  The government may con sider waiving FAT for those contractors that have previously produced this item.  If FAT is required, deliveries will commence 60 days after FAT have been approved.  The CHQD is an assembly that is a part of the drink system for the M40 Series Protective G as Mask.  The quick disconnect end of the CHQD interfaces with the M1 Canteen Cap allowing the user to drink water from a canteen when the plunger within the CHQD housing is actuated.  The other end of the CHQD attaches to an external rubber drink tube lea ding to the mask.  Within the aluminum housing of the CHQD is a spring, plunger, gasket and end fitting.  As part of this assembly, a curved (90 degree nominal) aluminum tube elbow connects to the end fitting within the housing.  The overall length of the CHQD assembly is approximately 2 1/8 inches consisting of the housing (approximately 1 Ã‚Â½ inches long, .438 inch nominal diameter) and the bent aluminum tube.  The tube (3/16 approximate outside diameter) before bending measures approximately 1 Ã‚Â¼ inch es in length.  Since the CHQD is part of the mask system, this assembly must not leak when not in use for drinking.  To assure proper performance, leakage and airflow resistance testing of the assembly is required.  FOB is Destination.  Estimated issue dat e is March 4, 2004.  This solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.501, 5.102(2)(7) and 14.205-1(c) therefore hardcopies will not be provided.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New Jersey officials, requires a firm fixed-price, requirements contract for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Jersey City and Hoboken areas of the State of New Jersey.  This spring, APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 955 trees with an estimated total diameter at breast height (dbh) of 6,224 via soil injection and an estimated 102 trees with an estimated total potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, Rose of Sharon (dbh equal or greater than 4 inches), European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza, London Plane, and Sycamore.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  A requirements contract will be awarded in the event additional control applications are needed or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUB Zone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAIC Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average receipts.  This agency does not issue hard copies of the solicitation; you must download a copy from this website. The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about the first week in February 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer three weeks thereafter.

<DESC>This is a re-posting of the February 13, 2004, presolicitation notice as email notifications were not sent to registered parties by the FedBizOpps system.  

The General Services Administration, National Office of Realty Services, is responsible for the acquisition of leasehold interests and related real estate services for the Federal government.  It is seeking highly qualified commercial real estate firms to assist with the performance of national commercial brokerage services.  GSA anticipates awarding approximately four Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order type contracts each with a base year and four (4) one-year option periods.  Evaluation of options for award does not obligate the Government to exercise the options.  The contracts will require the capability to provide services for the entire United States and for the U.S. Territories listed below under place of contract performance.  

GSA intends to conduct the acquisition following FAR Part 15, negotiated, best value source selection procedures and not FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. One award will be set aside for a qualified small business firm, team or joint venture.  The Government is not responsible for payment for services performed by contractors under these contracts. Contractors have the opportunity to collect the real estate commissions typically available in the commercial market place for services provided to the Government.  It is anticipated the Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued on or about March 5, 2004, with proposals due in approximately 45 days.  GSA is issuing the solicitation only electronically.  Interested parties will be able to access the solicitation at http://www.FedBizOpps.gov.  The site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation file and for using the Federal Business Opportunity website.  You may register at this site by solicitation number to receive email notification when the solicitation is posted.  However email notification is not guaranteed and interested parties are responsible for monitoring the website for postings.

<DESC>THIS PRE-SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF UP TO FOUR SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY, IDIQ DESIGN-BUILD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8A OR HUBZONE CONTRACTOR AND THE OTHER THREE ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED.  The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-04-R-0077.  The SIC Code for this Solicitation is 236220- Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects, new construction and renovations, including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for such facilities for activities in the southern area of the State of Texas managed by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command.  The work will be at the following primary locations:  Naval Air Station Corpus Christi and outlying airfields, Naval Air Station Kingsville and outlying airfields, and Naval Station Ingleside.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal, RFP, procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The anticipated workload is $75-$100 million over the life of all contracts and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $200 million.  Projects will vary in size from around $3 million to $15 million with the average project in the $3 - $6 million range.  This procurement will include potential award for one 8a eligible or one HUBZone eligible contractor.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II.  The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven proposers, design-build teams, based on design-build factors that include-Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications- including proposed subcontractors, and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects, new construction and renovation, including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8a or HUBZone contractor, only 1,  that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8a or HUBZONE contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8a or HUBZone contractor with the highest rating will receive a basic contract award in Phase II.  This successful 8a or HUBZone contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders. Otherwise eligible 8a and HUBZone contractors are invited to participate on an unrestricted basis as appropriate.   If the successful 8a or HUBZone contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.  In Phase II, a maximum of seven Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope-design options with the Governments published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects.  All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders.  Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.  Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable.  If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.  Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal.  Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation.  The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 30 January 2004.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  Prospective offerors must register themselves on the web site.  The official planholders list will be maintained and can be printed from the web.  Amendment will be posted on the web site for downloading.  This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments- therefore, IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.

SCOPE OF WORK

Position Title:  Democracy and Governance (D/G) Program Leader

I.  Background:

USAID/Morocco¡¦s D/G program, Improved Government Responsiveness to Citizens, is based on the urgent need for the Government of Morocco (GOM) to do a better job of responding to the real needs of its citizens. To be credible, the machinery of governance must be transparent, accountable, and equitable. This provides a viable basis for the growth of democracy.  Within the Arab world the Kingdom of Morocco is the country where the process of political liberalization has been sustained for the longest period of time.  Morocco has received praise over the past year from those who follow closely the evolution of democracy in the Middle East. 

The D/G program strives to support systems that inform central debates and leadership for improvements over the long term while building a partnership between citizens and government to immediately deliver tangible results at the local level.  The strategic objective is directly related to the Department of State¡¦s Middle East Partnership Initiative goals of a) promoting the rule of law and accountable, effective government institutions and b) strengthening the role of media in society.  In addition, good governance is a prerequisite for an enabling environment for investment and job creation. Therefore, the D/G program, Improved Government Responsiveness to Citizens, will be comprised of three intermediate results; 1) Local Governance Performance Improved, 2) Transparency in Governance Encouraged, and 3) National Enabling Environment Supported which includes a parliamentary strengthening activity.  This program is proposed under USAID¡¦s newly approved five-year strategy beginning in FY2004 and ending in FY2008.

The success of the D/G Strategic Objective will be measured by the following illustrative indicators, which will be finalized following design of the program:

ƒæ	Parliament's development and promulgation of  policies that would strengthen transparency, accountability, equity and local governance; 
ƒæ	Citizen¡¦s perception of corruption in government both at the local and the national level;
ƒæ	Number of audits in target Ministries and Local Development Units;

Incumbent has no authority to make commitments on behalf of the USG; however, recommendations are given substantial weight by USAID officials who exercise that authority.  Incumbent is authorized to initiate correspondence and discussions with senior government officials and private sector organizations and to articulate USAID strategy and implementation issues specific to the sector.

ƒæ	Manage the annual report and activity review process for all democracy activities in the Mission and coordinate such with relevant personnel in AID/Washington.

ƒæ	Ensure that all administrative and accountability requirements related to USAID/Morocco¡¦s democracy portfolio are handled in accordance with established policies and procedures.

ƒæ	Liaise with other donors and develop procedures to assure complementary of democracy-related activities.  Provide USAID/Morocco, the U.S. Embassy and USAID/Washington with information on similar projects or activities implemented by other donors in Morocco.

ƒæ	Maintain day-to-day contact with the democracy grantees, resident contractors and short-term advisors regarding their activities.

ƒæ	Supervise, evaluate and provide guidance to the USAID staff of the Democracy and Governance Strategic Objective team in their daily activities.  Immediate team will be composed of 2 to 3 senior and clerical Foreign Service National staff.

<DESC>The 1st Contracting Squadron, Langley AFB, VA is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for a potential requirement to provide military family housing maintenance services for both Main Base (244 units) and Bethel Manor Housing (1268 units).  Current contract services expire 30 September 2004.  It is anticipated that Bethel Manor will be privatized within the next 1 to 4 years with Main Base as an option in 5 years from the date of Bethel Manor’s privatization.  The estimated schedule for privatization implementation for Bethel Manor is March 2005 and March 2010 for Main Base.  Possible delays or circumstances may alter this schedule.  In order to ensure continuity of services, it is anticipated that an interim contract will be awarded for coverage until privatization is implemented.  The resulting contract will include an “opt-out” clause for each location allowing the government to terminate the remainder of the contract when privatization is implemented.  The government will provide the contractor a 90-day notice prior to implementation for each location.  It is anticipated that the period of performance for Bethel Manor will be from 01 October 2004 to 30 September 2005.  Three additional option years may be exercised extending the period of performance until 30 September 2008.  It is anticipated that the period of performance for Main Base will be from 01 October 2004 to 30 September 2005.  Seven additional option years may be exercised extending the period of performance until 30 September 2012.  NAICS Code 238990 is applicable to this effort, which has a small business threshold of $12M.  The government is seeking information and comments from industry on various topics that will be used to refine the requirement and acquisition strategy to include the following:  (a) the government is contemplating a firm fixed price type of contract to fulfill this requirement based upon previous acquisition history.  (b) Initial research indicates this service is commercial in nature and we are soliciting beneficial commercial practices and terms and conditions for consideration.  (c) This potential requirement may be set-aside for certified 8(a) small business participation pending the interest received in response to this sources sought notice.  Interested 8(a) small businesses that believe they have the capability to perform should complete the attached Small Business Capability Assessment/Questionnaire and submit it to the POCs listed below.  The Small Business Capability Assessment/Questionnaire is designed to provide general information regarding a firm’s capability and eligibility.  It is also designed to allow industry to comment on the concept of the “opt-out” clause and the Draft Statements of Work.  All industry comments are encouraged and welcomed to assist us with this unique requirement.  All documents associated with this projected requirement will be posted on the FedBizOpps website, www.eps.gov.  Please submit your responses by noon EST on 27 February 2004.  The primary POC for this procurement is 2d Lt Patricia Skutnik, 1 CONS/LGCS, 757-764-4915, e-mail: patricia.skutnik@langley.af.mil.  However, responses should be submitted to  Mr. Robert Miller, 1 CONS/LGCS, 757-764-2926, e-mail: robert.miller2@langley.af.mil or Ms. Christin Lockhart, 1 CONS/LGCS, 757-764-2241, e-mail: christin.lockhart@langley.af.mil, the Contracting Officer for this acquisition.

<CONTACT>Barbara A. Rolph Contracting Officer 3608565700362 Barbara_Rolph@nps.gov;
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.    THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  The North Cascades National Park Complex is researching the availability of sources for the:  (1)  rehabilitation of two suspension trail bridges,  and (2) the replacement of a third suspension trail bridge.   It is anticipated that two separate solicitations will be issued for which award will be made.   All three trail bridges are located within Ross Lake National Recreation Area of North Cascades National Park Complex in northern Washington State.  The rehabilitation work of the first two bridges consists of replacement of the existing timber towers with engineered steel towers and involves the erection of temporary towers, mainlines, and suspenders; replacement of existing timber suspender needle beams with steel beams engineered to carry the design loads; and replacement of the existing sway system with steel angle iron sway braces bolted to the new steel suspender needle beams.    Access is by boat, hiking, or horseback riding.   Boat access from the south end of Ross Lake at  Ross Dam requires coordination with Seattle City Light for barging services as there is no direct road access to the sites.   Access by boat can also be gained from the north end of Ross Lake by traveling through British Columbia, Canada and back to the US border at Hozomeen.    Access via hiking or horseback riding is at a distance of up to 16 miles.  The third suspension trail bridge requires replacement of a bridge that was washed away during a flood event in the fall of 2003.    Access is by hiking or horseback riding.   The trailhead is located at MP 130, State Route 20, at the Colonial Creek Campground South Unit.   The distance to the site is about 1-mile from the trailhead.   All trails for both solicitations are considered to be in remote backcountry areas.   Small gas powered hand tools and portable electrical power generators for hand tools are allowed.    It is expected that some materials will need to be flown in by helicopter.  Proposed contractors shall have at least 5-years experience in repair or construction of suspension bridge structures located in remote locations.   Contractors will be asked to provide information on a minimum of three bridge structures of a similar construction type which have been in service for at least 3-years.  The estimated value of the rehabilitation projects is under $250,000.    The estimated value of the replacement project is between $250,000 and $500,000.   Interested Contractors are asked to submit a brief statement detailing experience and qualifications to perform the work.   Interested Contractors are also asked to state whether they are qualifying 8a firms, HubZone firms, small or large business firms.    Submit information to Contracting Officer, Barbara A. Rolph, North Cascades National Park Complex, 810 State Route 20, Sedro Woolley, WA 98284, or to email address Barbara_Rolph@nps.gov no lated than March 5, 2004.

<DESC>Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico has a requirement for developing a program with Microsoft Sql Database that is able to quickly and accurately retrieve specific individual data such as Social Security Number (SSN) off the AF Common Access Card (CAC). The data must be linked to the new Sql database that will be hosted on the current Kirtland AFB server. Retrieved information will be displayed on three interactive touch screens at one primary and two secondary locations. The processing official will work the primary screen and issuing officials will work the secondary screens. If the CAC cannot be read the processing official should be able to manually input data to provide a link to the same data.
 
Standards A and B
The following standards are required. The individual must meet standards A and B (located within the Microsoft access database) to be allowed to continue through the process. Both standards have a subjective and quantitative portion to them located within the database – both of these must be met in order to meet each standard. These standards should be displayed separately to prevent the individual from processing any further. Once a new AF Common Access Card (CAC) card is scanned/read and a new individual is identified the process should start over. 

Standards C and D
The processing official will query the individual that is being processed as to whether they currently meet standards C and D. The processing official will need to make a single input into the system at this point. Both C and D standards must be met in order to continue processing. If the individual does not meet both standards the program should not allow any additional processing of that individual to take place.  If the individual does meet the established standards their qualifications will be displayed. 
Qualification
The database must be populated with multiple qualifications for each individual such as A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Some qualifications my be redundant – in that case qualification A should take precedence over qualification B and qualification E should take precedence over qualification F. One qualification C is based on the individual also meeting qualification B. Qualifications B and F will no longer be required at some point. At this point qualification C will also be based on the individual meeting qualification A. 
Processing Official Qualification Selection
The interactive touch screen should display (highlight) the individual’s ability to fill as many positions as possible based on their qualifications. The screen should also display the current individual’s name and rank. The processing official will decide which position they want that individual to fill and select the corresponding highlighted position using the touch screen. When a new individual is processed the screen should display the individual’s ability to fill as many positions as possible based on their qualifications that are not already filled. The processing officials screen should show the current status of all positions in real time. 
Equipment Issue
The equipment requirements of the position the individual is assigned need to be displayed on both of the secondary screens. (Secondary screens should be mounted overhead and space consideration may be a factor in determining monitor size). The issuing official that provides the necessary equipment to the individual will annotate on the touch screen when the issue has been completed. This update needs to be reflected on the processing officials screen as well as being removed from both issuing official’s screens. Only individuals pending issue should be displayed on the issuing officials screens. 
Records
The program should provide a record of all individuals who processed, the time they were entered into the system, the position they were assigned, or reason they were not assigned a position. This record needs to be storable and printable.
Emergency Override
An emergency feature that required a secondary confirmation by the processing official will allow the processing official to assign the current individual being processed to any position that is not already filled regardless of whether they meet any of the standards or qualifications. If a person fills a position based on emergency override that information needs to be captured on the stored version and printout regarding what standard or qualification was overridden.
Maintenance
 Program must enable database be secured and maintained by a limited number of security forces personnel only using their current existing computers and LAN connections.

1 April 2004.

<SUBJECT>D -- Federal Asset Sales (FAS), Real Property, efficient Marketplaces, end-to-end Value Added Services (VAS) Solution, Request for Information.
<DESC>Background:  Conceived in November of 2001 by the Quicksilver E-Government Task Force, the Federal Asset Sales (FAS) program is designed to improve and optimize the way that the federal government reuses and disposes of all types of federally owned assets, including real property and personal property.  Each year the Federal Government disposes of and sells billions of dollars of surplus under- and un-utilized property and forfeited assets. Todays government real estate sales activities can be improved, via e-commerce and other process enhancements, to maximize the governments net sales proceeds while increasing sales velocity, and by facilitating the active participation and bidding by citizens. FAS seeks the services of a Service Aggregator (SA) that can assist Federal agencies with selling and disposing of real property assets, including the strategic planning and analysis necessary to maximize net sales proceeds and accelerate disposal velocity. Although the SA will have the responsibility of determining the most appropriate method(s) for selling agencies’ excess real property, its level of autonomy may depend on the SA-proposed business model chosen to dispose of the specific property. The SA will work closely with agencies to develop the necessary marketing and disposal plans in order to most effectively and efficiently dispose of their property.  Sales disposition alternatives can include public outcry, sealed bid, and online marketplaces.  In some situations, agencies may empower the SA with the autonomy to invest in a property and otherwise make strategic asset and portfolio decisions designed to maximize sales proceeds and accelerate disposal.  Potentially, the SAs compensation will be derived from taking a pre-determined percentage of net sales proceeds. This percentage has not yet been determined. Objective:  FAS is conducting Market Research to assess industry capabilities for disposing and selling of Federal Real Property Assets.  This market research is focusing on three component services: Sales Solution Development (One-Time Creation of the efficient Marketplace solution); Marketplace Operations (Continuous sales transactions through multiple online, offline, and simulcast auction Marketplaces); and Value-Added Services (VAS) Operations (Provide interested agencies with optional services to strategically analyzed disposition options, channel and parcel assets to the most effective online/offline sales venues, and support pre- and post-sales activities).   These optional VAS may include but are not limited to: Refinement of Asset Descriptions and Standardization of Asset Conditions, Strategic Analysis of Property Disposition Alternatives, Buyer Qualification, Property Due Diligence, Bid Deposits, Property Marketing, Conveyance Document Preparation, Site Inspection Support, Zoning, Parceling, Asset Valuation and Appraisals, Maintenance and Upgrades, and Settlement and Closing Support. The VAS component, as proposed, will be offered to agencies in a multi-level staged approach. Each level of VAS will be optional for the agency and will be proposed based upon that agencies’ specific needs regarding property disposal. The SA will present their recommendation of VAS in its property disposal plan to the agencies. In certain instances, the SA may choose to provide the cash flows necessary to fund the VAS that will maximize net sales proceeds. This optional multi-level staged approach will allow agencies and the SA to work together to determine the most appropriate actions needed to improve the efficiency of the federal real property disposal process and offer the opportunity to maximize net sales proceeds while accelerating sales velocity.  While the typical sales transaction will have the objective of selling the property immediately, in certain instances the SA may provide strategic recommendations, either from a portfolio sales perspective or based on asset-specific situations, that are designed to maximize sales proceeds.  
Capability Statement: NAIC is 531390 Real estate asset management services (except property management).  Industry should demonstrate a broad range of capabilities for fulfilling the needs and outcomes of the FAS initiative.  Capabilities include, but are not limited to: Marketing analysis and advertising; effectively channel and parcel (where appropriate) property to the most beneficial sales venue; charge competitive and reasonable rates for real property sales channels and services; provide strategic VAS as listed above, use established channels (i.e. e-Marketplaces and a network of VAS providers) to leverage existing commercial best practices, and create new channels as appropriate; market to Federal Agencies, buyers, and new or emerging marketplaces; provide buyer and agency customer service and sales management; and  supporting the disposition of additional properties.  Section 8(a), HUBZone, and other SBA certified small or disadvantaged businesses, including 8(a) Business Development Mentor/Protégé participations are encouraged to respond. Additionally, Teaming/Joint Ventures to develop the desired capabilities are encouraged.   FAS Desired Outcomes:  Increase agencies net proceeds from real property sales when appropriate, while increasing sales velocity; help federal agencies determine the most effective channel available for real property sales; decrease agencies’ expenses related to real property sales; and make it easier for citizens, businesses, and government agencies to find and buy government real property assets.  The ideal capability statement will demonstrate and exhibit the respondents comprehensive real estate experience, including at least the following: multi-channel real estate sales, commercial real estate consulting, established network of appraisers and other VAS providers, government contracting, partnership/joint ventures, real estate marketing, wide geographic reach, both commercial and residential property portfolio and asset management, real estate closings, creativity and professional innovation, and demonstrated capabilities to plan and manage an initiative of this magnitude.  The objective of this RFI is to obtain capabilities statements, based upon the requirements outlined above, from all (large and small) businesses interested in this opportunity. Further, respondents are encouraged to provide feedback on the following concepts:  1. The viability of the SA and VAS provider approach, particularly in terms of funding cost beneficial property services and being compensated based on net sales proceeds.   2. The conflicts between the FAS program objectives of accelerating asset disposal time versus maximizing net sale proceeds. The respondents should comment on the ability to accomplish both objectives simultaneously and demonstrate any experience they have in doing so.   3. The use of tax subsidies, zoning changes, and any other applicable real property economic factors that can be leveraged to increase the net sales proceeds for real property. In order to display their level of expertise, the respondent should provide examples of instances in which they have leveraged these factors to increase the net proceeds on the sale of real property as well as provide a listing of additional methods used.  4. The application of an appropriate business model(s) to facilitate the FAS Real Property Sales Program objectives and the issues outlined above. The respondent should provide their feedback on possible business organizational structures (i.e. joint-venture, public-private partnership, trusts, etc.) that would provide a level of autonomy and flexibility necessary to meet the outcomes and objectives outlined in this RFI.  5. Necessary portfolio data and other asset specific information required in order to make strategic analysis decisions on the disposal of a property and accomplish the outlined objectives of the Service Aggregator concept.   
Respondents should identify any information they consider to be sensitive or proprietary.  Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside, restrict competition in some way, or solicit offers from all responsible sources.  Identify your interest in either being a Prime or Subcontractor for this requirement. Should the procurement be set-aside for small business, FAR clause 52.219-14 “Limitations on Subcontracting” (DEC 1996) will apply.  All interested businesses are hereby invited to submit a capabilities statement of no more than 15 pages (not including past performance information) to demonstrate their ability to provide the services outlined above. The capabilities statement should be tailored to this request and identify the respondents capabilities to complete the requirements listed above, including information on key staff experience, a description of experience with similar projects, and present and past performance information. For each reference listed include the name of a contact person, telephone number, e-mail address, type of contract awarded and date. In addition to addressing the requirements listed above respondents must provide information concerning their organizations gross revenue for the previous fiscal year, number of employees in company, number of years in existence and primary focus of business.  In order for FAS to determine a potential acquisition strategy, interested parties shall also include a cover letter that includes company name, points of contact, telephone numbers, fax numbers, e-mail addresses, prime or sub-contractor interest, and identifies the company as one or more of the following: 1) small business; 2) 8(a) business; 3) HUBZone small business; 4) small disadvantaged business; 5) woman-owned small business; (6) veteran-owned small business; (7) service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or (8) large business. Please note: This Sources Sought/RFI is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought/RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested. Response to the request will not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  All responses to this Sources Sought/RFI must be received by 4:00 P.M. EST on March 5, 2004 and emailed to the Point of Contact: Kathy Corley kathy.corley@gsa.gov .

<SUBJECT>99 -- Request for Expressions of Interest - Participation in the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center's Education and Training Partnership with the State of Oklahoma's Colleges, Universities and Trade Schools
<DESC>1)  This is a request for companies interested in working with the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) and State of Oklahoma educational institutions to graduate/produce workers prepared to fill a variety of blue collar and white collar positions at OC-ALC in the future.  OC-ALC and Oklahoma educational institutions established an Education and Training Partnership a few years ago to do just that.  This joint endeavor has been very successful to date.  This partnership is very important in light of an aging existing OC-ALC workforce and a smaller pool of workers in younger generations.  At the same time, OC-ALC is embarking upon several transformation initiatives to improve efficiency and effectiveness and ultimately improve support to our operational forces.     2)  OC-ALC's success in the future will depend upon its ability to recruit and hire a highly capable organic workforce while at the same time expanding its partnerships with industry.  As we expand these partnerships with industry, our industry partners will also have a need for new workers.  To avoid competing for the limited number of current graduates, OC-ALC is interested in working with industry and state educational institutions to increase its current capacity for producing skilled workers.  OC-ALC envisions interested companies collaborating with their industry colleagues to jointly determine their future workforce needs in support of Tinker Air Force Base by entering into an agreement for that increased capacity with state educational institutions.  OC-ALC also envisions establishing an Associate Contractor-like Agreement with its industry partners to outline the rules of engagement.  OC-ALC will not be a party to or responsible for any industry commitment or agreement for hiring workers produced by state educational institutions.     3)  However, OC-ALC does expect to cooperate with its industry partners in this endeavor.  Those companies interested in discussing the potential for working with OC-ALC and Oklahoma educational institutions for future education and training needs are requested to submit written or electronic expressions of interest to the Contracting Officer listed below not later than 19 March 2004.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation DTCG85-04-Q-625413 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is small business set-aside procurement.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposal being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  The NAICS is 721110.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a separate solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) for “Deionized Water Service and Equipment/Materials” This procurement shall be conducted utilizing Best Value Selection (BVS), which seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the offerors and the Government.  BVS takes advantage of the lower complexity of Mid-Range procurements and predefines the value characteristics, which will serve as the discriminators among offers. BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts) or the lowest most probable cost (cost type contracts).  However, the Government will consider awarding to an offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.  Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so. STATEMENT OF WORK:  The following statement of work serves as the Government's requirements.	NASA/JSC plans to award a contract for “Deionized Water Service and Equipment/Materials”.  The Contractor will provide water testing to domestic water or pre-treated water supplied at various locations throughout Johnson Space Center, and NASA owned property at Ellington Field, Houston, Texas for a period of five years, consisting of a base year with four one year options. The contractor will be required to develop a detailed contamination profile which will be used to prescribe the type and number of deionizer tanks, and/or filters needed to meet the government’s water requirements. Tanks and equipment/materials shall be provided by the contractor and designed to produce trouble-free, maintenance-free high purity water.  The minimum tank exchange rate shall be every four months. The Contracting Officer shall issue a delivery order in advance each quarter for estimated tank rental and regeneration charges.  The contract shall provide services not to exceed the total value of the authorized delivery order.  The not to exceed amount is $88K per year for five years, all options included.   Exchange (or regeneration of any polishing tank will be based on the resistivity evidence that the tank is expended to the extent that the water quality requirements specified can no longer be satisfied.  Any additional supplies required will be paid separately upon submission of a signed work order by the Contracting Officer or broken out on the monthly invoice.	No monthly charge will be paid for the first month immediately following installation of any tank.  Exchange (or regeneration) of any polishing tank will be based on the resistivity evidence that the tank is expended to the extent that the water quality requirements specified can no longer be satisfied.  Any additional supplies required will be paid separately upon submission of a signed work order by the Contracting Officer or broken out on the monthly invoice. The water supplied at each location shall be guaranteed to produce the quality of water required for any specific application, up to the maximum of 18 megohm-cm resistivity at 25 degrees Celsius. The contractor shall provide in-line quality monitors under this contract that will alert the government immediately when resin tanks need to be changed. The government will then contact the contractor to exchange the tanks. All tanks shall be replaced within 24 hours after notification.
