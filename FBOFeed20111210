<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division (NCD), New England Soldier Support and Individual Equipment (NESSIE) branch has a requirement for the manufacture and delivery of Modular Airborne Weapons Case (MAWC), size small and large. The MAWC, small and large, is needed because of an existing capability gap in the ability to deliver a paratrooper's weapons system and select special items of equipment to the ground during an airborne assault. The integration of advanced weaponry, optics, thermal sights, and lasers into the formation exceeds the current capability. This new capability increases the protection of advanced weapons systems and enhances the paratrooper's ability to safely land and rapidly deploy weapons during both combat and training missions. Both the small and large versions of the Modular Airborne Weapons Case shall provide the paratrooper with a durable, lightweight, and adjustable weapons case allowing for maximum stowage of essential weaponry, optics, and equipment; able to withstand a drop of 27 feet per second to safely deliver the Airborne Soldier's equipment to the ground. The Modular Airborne Weapons Case shall be modular in design allowing for adjustability in both length and width and constructed of low maintenance fabric that is durable and lightweight yet provides critical padding where required for safety. The MAWC must be compatible with current static line personnel parachute systems. The MAWC will be a non-developmental item proposed by the successful Offeror. The NAICS code for this requirement is 314999. This acquisition will be conducted on a full and open basis and will be awarded based upon best value under FAR Part 15. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted ON OR ABOUT 30 DECEMBER 2011 to the Natick Contracting Division web site at https://www3.natick.army.mil, under Business Opportunities, Current Acquisitions, W911QY-12-R-0026. Proposals will be due 30 days after release of the RFP. Firms will not be reimbursed for any costs associated with proposal preparation. Only virgin material is to be used in the manufacture of these units. The Berry Amendment will apply. Questions may be addressed ONLY by email to mark.marchioli@us.army.mil or faxed to (508) 233-9673. Questions may not be submitted by phone.

<DESC>QUESTIONS/ANSWERS
<p>Please submit all questions no later than 4pm PST Dec 3, 2011. All questions will be answered and posted on FBO NLT Dec 10, 2011.</p>
<p>All questions should be submitted via email to <a href="mailto:crystal.rossman@ang.af.mil">crystal.rossman@ang.af.mil</a>.<br /><br />1. Is the 720 annual hours a guarantee (as one part of the RFP says) or an estimate without guarantee (as another part says)?<br />ANSWER: 720 annual hours is a guarantee</p>
<p>2. Is the meaning of the change in scope of work made on the 29th to eliminate any intent to use the aircraft for other than pilot training, currency and proficiency?</p>
<p>ANSWER: No. We do not anticipate using the aircraft outside of training/proficiency.</p>
<p>3. Each of CLINs 0001 through 0003, and the corresponding delivery clause, provides for deliveries to commence January 1 of each year. In the event that unavailability of specified aircraft delays first delivery, will the annual periods (a) be changed to 12-month periods commencing on the first delivery of services; (b) reduce the first year to a "stub year" ending on December 31, 2012, with successive years being calendar years; or (c) other?</p>
<p>ANSWER: The contract year will begin on the first delievery day and go out a year from there (ie. 15 Jan 2012 to 15 Jan 2013)</p>
<p>4. CLIN 0002, for the year 2013 (second year of the contract), is captioned "Option Year 1.". This is not consistent with the statement that the contract will be for a fixed initial term of 24 months, with three one-year options. Please clarify.</p>
<p>ANSWER: The 1449 solicitation will be amend to reflect 24 months for the first period and 1 year for each option year.</p>
<p>5. CLIN 0003 (also captioned "Option Year 1") is for the first option year of 3. There is no CLIN for either of the second or three option years. Is it intended that these years, if the option is exercised, will be under the same terms and conditions?</p>
<p>ANSWER: All follow on option years wil be under the same terms and conditions as the base year.</p>
<p>6. L-2 Price on page 66 specifies that the price includes " flight time to/from March after/prior required services". If the aircraft are based at an airport other than March ARB, is this understood to refer to that airport, rather than March?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Yes, the price includes transit to and from the airport where the aircraft is based. The aircrew may elect to do its ground training from where it's based, or from March, ARB.</p>
<p>7. Item L-1 d on page 66 requires submission of "Statement of Qualifications defined below.". Where is the definition?</p>
<p>ANSWER: The Statement of Qualificaiton is a description of how you will be able to meet the requirements of the SOW.</p>
<p>8. Item L-1 c on page 66 refers to "Offeror Representations and Certifications (para (b) on Page 18 . . . .)". This page reference does not appear to be correct. What is the correct reference?</p>
<p>ANSWER: This paragraph will be corrected to reflect which Reps and Certs are required. All contractors must be CCR and ORCA Registered.</p>
<p>9. I have contacted Freeman Holdings at March Air Reserve and they said there is no hanger space available on the airport, in the SOW it said the aircraft doesn't have to be located on March AFB but within 25NM. I have been in contact with Riverside airport but it doesn't seem they have appropriate hangers available for what were needing. My question was do you know of any space available on the field? Or where is the most desired location for this requirement?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Although it would be ideal to have the airplane based at March (on the civilian side), there are no hangars there currently. Our preference is to have the plane based at an airport within a short drive of March ARB. However, anywhere within a 25NM radius of March ARB is acceptable.</p>
<p>10. Will it be more favorable to propose more than one aircraft or is a single aircraft the only need of the ANG?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Ideally, the vendor would have 2 aircraft. However, 1 is perfectly acceptable as long as scheduled maintenance doesn't interfere with our flying schedule. In this event, we would expect to have the vendor make arrangements for a spare aircraft available (perhaps subleased/rented).</p>
<p>11. As it is written it is not clear from the SOW if ARCAP Operations are to be conducted as Public Aircraft Operations or as FAR Part 91?</p>
<p>Neither Public Use nor FAR Part 91 is fully supported by the SOW as it is currently written. Each has its advantages and disadvantages but it is essential that one be specified to complete the proposal.</p>
<p>Based on the 24 Mar 2011 FAA Notice of Policy Regarding Civil Aircraft Operators Providing Contract Support to Government Entities (Public Aircraft Operations), unless Public Aircraft Operations are specified, Civil Aircraft Operations are assumed, and all applicable rules under CFR 14 will be enforced.</p>
<p>Most significant issues are:</p>
<p>Public Aircraft Operations:</p>
<p>-Govt assumes liability.</p>
<p>- Govt IPs can train and qualify pilots</p>
<p>- If Public Aircraft Operations are desired, specific verbiage in the contract, in accordance with the FAA policy, will need to be included. See attached FAA policy letter.</p>
<p>Civil Aircraft Operations:</p>
<p>- All CFR 14 regulations must be followed. Training and qualifications must be provided by either contractor or military FAA qualified Certified Flight Instructors (CFIs)</p>
<p>ANSWER: We would like the vendors to provide costs per hour for both options: the Public Aircraft operations, and Civil Aircraft Operations. Although we'll most likely proceed with the public variety, we'd like to see the cost difference for both. You do not need to include cost for a CFI. Our unit has a few military CFIs if we elected to use the civil option.</p>
<p>We are currently researching these two options with the FAA and Military Legal before we decide which route we'll take.</p>
<p>12. Will the contract be for two years and 3 option years or 1 year with two option years?</p>
<p>Section 1.2.1 states, "This contract will be for a minimum of 24 months, with the option of continuing up to an additional 36 months, renewable on a yearly basis."</p>
<p>These statements are inconsistent with the SUPPLIES/SERVICES QUANTITY UNIT PRICE AMOUNT section which indicates a 1 year contract with two option years.</p>
<p>ANSWER: We're looking for 2 years, and being able to renew on a yearly basis for the next 3 years.</p>
<p>13. Does Para L-8 apply to this SOW?</p>
<p>Para L-8 Refers to response time to restricted areas. This does not appear to belong in the SOW for this contract. Suggest that the Para L requirements be reviewed for applicability.</p>
<p>ANSWER: Para L-8 will be deleted off the 1449.</p>
<p>14. Is there a specific format or specific information required for the submission of Past Performance data?</p>
<p>ANSWER: I will post a sample format for the Past Performance data NLT 13 Dec.</p>
<p>15. Does the requirement for security of the aircraft preclude hangaring the aircraft in a secure hangar that serves activity other than this contract?</p>
<p>ANSWER: No. Our intent is to have the aircraft in a secure location while not in use.</p>
<p>16. What is the format requirement for delivery of the proposal? i.e. hard copy(# of Copies), CD (# of CDs), email.</p>
<p>ANSWER Proposals can be sent either electronically to crystal.rossman@ang.af.mil or mailed to the address provided. If you send it electronically make sure you receive confirmation it was received.</p>
<p>17. There are scenarios where damage to the aircraft, not the fault of the contractor could take the aircraft out of service for several weeks at a time. In such a case there would be no revenue during that period, however the contractor's fixed costs would remain. Would it be possible for the Government to break the guaranteed 720 hours per year into a monthly guarantee? We feel that 75% of the prorated 60 hours per month would cover fixed costs.</p>
<p>ANSWER: Prorating would not be beneficial during the early stages. We're expecting to fly the bulk of our hours towards the last portion of the year as more of our pilots get checked out. Our desire is to have the vendor provide a spare aircraft in this event.</p>
<p>18. Q1 is based on the assumption that the most cost effective solution is to propose a single aircraft. Adding a second aircraft will add to the cost but will assure availability. Additional cost could be mitigated if the second aircraft was not exclusive use to the Government. Would it be acceptable to propose two aircraft, equipped as specified in the SOW, with a guaranteed availability of one aircraft each day and allowing the second aircraft to be used for non-contract purposes?</p>
<p>ANSWER: This would be a good option for us, as we want to avoid scheduling our flights around any maintenance down time.</p>
<p>19. If the Government specifies Public Use Aircraft Operations there may be additional administrative requirements placed on the contractor. If this is the case, will these additional requirements be specified in the SOW to ensure all bidders are bidding to the same requirements?</p>
<p>ANSWER: We want hourly cost estimates for both Public use and civil use options. We are currently researching these two options with the FAA and Military Legal before we decide which route we'll take.</p>
