<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Implementation Options for National Aerospace Initiative – Hypersonics Support. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase Implementation Options for National Aerospace Initiative – Hypersonics support from GPS Solutions, Inc., pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Competition is impractical because: (a) GPS Solutions recently completed a study for the Advanced Space Transportation Program (ASTP) Office for the precursor activity to support “Implementation Options for National Aerospace Initiative – Hypersonics.”  The current proposed effort in the attached SOW requires building on that body of knowledge:  therefore, GPS Solutions is uniquely qualified to provide new deliverables similar to and directly related to deliverables provided in support of the precursor activity.  As an example, GPS Solutions demonstrated unique techniques in analyzing low-technology-readiness-level research and technology development, which is a major thrust of both the proposed SOW and the precursor activity.  (b) Based on the previous effort, GPS Solutions is very knowledgeable as to the intricacies of associated program planning as related to goals and requirements of this program.	(c) GPS Solutions has demonstrated that it already has the in-depth knowledge and current points of contact to accurately address questions related to working relationships between NASA and the DoD, another key aspect of follow-on tasks from the precursor activity.  (d) In addition, GPS Solutions has demonstrated thorough familiarity with the related aspects of numerous technology-demonstrator or prototype programs, such as those for the DC-X, X-33, X-34, and X-37.  This knowledge is vital to research  at the level of detail required to accomplish the NAI – Hypersonics initiative described in the SOW.  (e) Since this work must be accomplished within a few  months, there is not adequate time available nor is it cost effective to have another offeror become as well informed on the key issues, the relevant recent history, and the programmatic details that impinge directly on prioritizing and focusing the requisite work required to facilitate rapid synthesis of recommendations for options for the NAI - Hypersonics. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on March 5, 2003.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Air Force Space and Missiles System Center, Global Positioning System (GPS) Joint Program Office (SMC/CZK) solicits research and development proposals for Modernized GPS User Equipment.  This is a research and development effort being acquired under the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 35.016, Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as modified for the Air Force's Program Research & Development Announcement (PRDA) Process.  Any MUE PRDA contract(s) awarded as a result of this announcement are intended to reduce risk and advance technology required for the future development of modernized military GPS User Equipment. The desired outcome at the conclusion of the PRDA contracts is a more complete understanding by the Government and industry of the technical and implementation requirements and associated risk regarding: 1) Implementation, certification, integration, and operation of the MUE Security Architecture, 2) Ability to design, develop, and produce MUE that can effectively detect, acquire, track, and process M-Code and M-Code Navigation Data (MNAV) under nominal and stressed conditions, and 3) The feasibility and advisability of implementing Y-Code signal in MUE.  The Statements of Objectives (SOOs) for each of these three efforts are posted on the GPS JPO Bidder's Library at http://gps.losangeles.af.mil/. All interested Offerors are highly encouraged to address all three SOOs in a single integrated proposal. Proposals will be accepted that do not address all three SOOs, based on the Government acceptance of justification for omissions and Government evaluation of exceptional merit in furthering a particular MUE program objective. The Government feels that there are significant synergies and interdependences among the SOOs and will closely evaluate proposed technical solution strategies that address these interdependencies and/or synergies.  Proposals should be structured to explicitly capitalize on synergies between the three study subjects and how these interdependencies and synergies are to be exploited.  Interested offerors are highly encouraged to view and/or download the full MUE PRDA solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) homepage at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Direct questions to the Contracting Point of Contact identified in the announcement.  A Pre-proposal Conference will be held on Tuesday 4 March 2003 from 8:00 am to 10:00 with one-on-one meetings to follow at the Aerospace Corporation, Building A-1, Room 1062, 2350 E. El Segundo Blvd., El Segundo, CA  90245. Attendance is limited to a maximum of ten (10) people from each company/division.  Follow-on one-on-one sessions and facility access information should be coordinated with Lt Richard Kniseley, (310) 363-5390, richard.kniseley@losangeles.af.mil by 3 Mar 2003. Time allotted per contractor will depend on the number of one-on-one requests received.  Small businesses are highly encouraged to participate.  The Government reserves the right to award contract(s) to small business(es) that satisfactorily demonstrate required capability. The NAICS code is 541710 and the size standard is 1000 employees.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to modify contract N00024-01-C-2900 with Electric Boat Corporation (EB), 75 Eastern Point Road, Groton, CT  06340, for the purpose of procuring services required to staff and operate a Nuclear Regional Maintenance Department (NRMD) at SUBASE, New London.  The modification will procure NRMD services through government fiscal year 2003 and establish two one-year options for the continuation of NRMD services through government fiscal years 2004 and 2005.  The level-of-effort contract will require project management, engineering and planning, training, inspection and nuclear services to accomplish intermediate-level nuclear submarine maintenance, modernization and repairs in support of operational nuclear submarines including maintaining and modernizing facilities and equipment and providing off-hull support of submarine maintenance.  Work will be performed at the submarine base in New London, CT with occasional efforts at the company’s shipyard in Groton, CT.  The dynamics of submarine force operation requires an NRMD capable of meeting workload surges and shifting skill requirements on a daily basis.  This requires an NRMD contractor to be a nuclear qualified shipyard and to maintain a staff in close proximity to SUBASE, New London capable of rapidly providing the necessary mix of personnel.  Electric Boat Corporation is the only source with a nuclear qualified shipyard staff within the necessary proximity of SUBASE, New London capable of meeting the NRMD requirements.  Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact EB directly.  (See Note 22).*****

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate with Timothy Korter, Gaithersburg, MD, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) Only One Source Reasonably Available, for additional research relating to the project entitled "THz Spectroscopy of Chemical and Biological Systems".  Preliminary investigations performed as part of the project showed that far-IR technologies can be used to identify biological spores, hazardous chemicals, pharmaceuticals, explosives, hoaxes and other liquid and solid materials sealed inside plastic and paper.  The research shall be expanded now to include other types of containers (e.g., glass vessels, bottles, and packaging materials) and to develop a means for scanning these packages for weapons threats.  This is a sole source requirement as the contractor has already proven the benefit of THz spectroscopy imaging methods when screening for possible chemicals/biologicals contained in plastic and paper.  Furthermore, he has established experimental and theoretical expertise in using ultrafast laser techniques for the spectroscopic study of molecular dynamics, far-IR absorption imaging, and modeling of vibrational processes in various material phases including liquids, liquid-surface, and solid phases.  The additional study must be performed by a source that demonstrates a complete up-to-date understanding of femtosecond lasers and vibrational spectroscopy, far-IR (THz) generation and detection using non-linear optics, software/hardware development and its implementation for far-IR spectroscopic data acquisition and imaging; and, the ability to theoretically model experimentally obtained ultrafast THz spectra and images.  The contractor is the only known source at this time with the advanced training and background capable of providing the required expertise to NIST.  A fixed price modification will be issued to the existing Purchase Order to cover the additional research on or about 03/10/03 with a performance period of six months.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541990 and the size standard is $6.0 mil.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing.  This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, the Government will consider all responses received by the closing date.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) is not available.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Responses to questions received:

Questions and Answers:

The following is a list of commonly asked questions and their answers --- 

1.	Q: The solicitation stated “100% Small Business Set Aside;” does that mean the vendor has to be small business?
A:  Yes. We’ll only accept proposals from small businesses for this particular solocitation.

2.	Q: The class size reads 1 person per class. Will the class size/participations vary based on the Windows subject being taught?
A: There are a total of 16 people for the various training. 1 person for Crystal Report 8.5, 4 people for MS Windows 2000 Network Infrastructure, 2 people for MS Windows 2000 Network and OSE, 3 people for implementing MS Windows 2000 Pro and Server, 2 people for implementing and administering MS Windows 2000 DS, 2 people for administering MS SQL Server 2000 Database, 2 people for programming a MS SQL Server 2000 Database. The ‘no later than’ dates we listed is a tentative schedule of deadlines on the last dates for the courses to start. The ideal situation we are looking for is to have system set up in which all the classes would be reserved in advance, so that whenever the students call up for the classes, there would be slots open. 
     
3.	Q: Will the 27 Feb 03 due date be extended?
A: Yes. Due to the number of questions we received, the dead line is now 4 March 03.

4.	Q: The solicitation stated: “provide training vouchers in one day increments.” Is it preferred that each class be taught in one-day sessions?
A: No. Since the customer didn’t specify any special requirements on how long each class should last, we would only ask for standard industry practice. The daily vouchers are just tickets for each day of training.

5.	Q: The solicitation mentioned the last possible date for each class to be taught. Will the actual dates be set by contractor, by student, or by consensus?
A: The actual dates will be decided by the contractor as long as the dates meet the deadlines.

6.	Q. Can there be more than one person per class?
A. Yes. Class size is up to the contractor.  
      
7.	Q. Line 0008 listed training for MS SWL Server? Shouldn’t it be SQL instead?
A. Yes. It should be SQL.

<DESC>Description of Need: The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is defining its acquisition strategy for the procurement of TH-6B helicopter parts and overhaul services for the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School (USNTPS).  The TH-6B helicopters are configured as variants of the commercial McDonnell Douglas MD369H. .  Depending on the information gathered from this announcement, it is our intent to solicit competitive proposals for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for parts and overhaul services for six TH-6Bs.  The contract will cover a period of five years comprised of one base year and four one-year options. The anticipated effort includes, but is not limited to, providing compatible, newly manufactured components and materials for routine maintenance and/or for repairs following mishaps or overstress incidents; providing overhaul and repair of USNTPS components to FAA specifications. Request for Information and Sources Sought: The purpose of this announcement is to: (1) determine the current industry base of potential qualified vendors to support the possibility of an other than full and open competition, 100% small business set-aside to satisfy the requirement identified; and, (2) seek recommendations from industry, based on our intent to award a five year IDIQ contract, on the most preferred contracting method using either Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12 or 15 procedures to acquire the required supplies and services.  FAR Part 12.207 -- Contract Type, requires that the Agencies shall use firm-fixed-price contracts or fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment for the acquisition of commercial items. Indefinite-delivery contracts (see Subpart 16.5) may be used where the prices are established based on a firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment. Use of any other contract type to acquire commercial items is prohibited.  We are seeking industry recommendations on how the Government can satisfy the above stated provision, while acknowledging that some of the parts maybe difficult to acquire in a reliable manner.  The Government intends to use the information collected from this announcement and other sources to aid it in defining its final acquisition strategy.   Responses to this announcement shall be submitted no later than 14 March 2003 to: Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, Attn: Mr. Fritz Musser (AIR 2.4.3.2.6), Building 441, Unit 7, 21983 Bundy Road, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127 Attn:  TH-6B.  Electronic responses are recommended and encouraged and should be submitted to Mr. Musser at the e-mail address listed below.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking small business sources to assist the Federal Government in its responsibility for oversight and monitoring of the over 16,800 nursing homes/facilities that provide long term care.  The North American Industry Classification (NAIC) code applicable to the proposed contract requirement is 541618.  

Potential Small Business sources must document their technical and management capability, background and past experience of performance of a contract(s) for the specific requirements set forth in this notice.  The written response (original and 5 copies) should be limited to 25 pages or less and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the date of this notice.  Organizations must specify a name and telephone number of a point of contact.  The address for receipt of proposals is:  CMS, Attention:  Herman Harris, Contract Specialist, Room C2-21-15, 7500 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21244-1850.

Specific requirements of the proposed contract effort considered to be necessary for successful performance are:
	Professionals with the credentials, experience and technical history and expertise to coordinate and conduct national certification or quality assurance reviews of programs or facilities that serve the elderly/geriatric and long term care population;

	Professionals with current or prior experience with the application of Federal laws, regulations, guidelines, State Operation Manual (SOM) and Federal survey protocols related to the survey and certification process for long term care;

	Adequate administrative support to support the wide range of operational procedures necessary to conduct contract tasks.

	Financial resources needed to efficiently and effectively conduct and sustain contract tasks.

	Technology and the professional expertise to develop and maintain communication with Contract team members, CMS's Central Office and its ten Regional Offices (RO);

	Data system technology, which includes the use of computers, printers, electronic mail, fax and teleconference capabilities approved by CMS;

	Ability to prepare and provide technical analyses and reports on survey findings, survey results and State performance;

	Quality assurance-internal evaluation for accuracy and consistency of results.

	Technical expertise in the development of training materials and policies and procedures and other materials as needed for the Project Officer.

In 1987, the Omnibus Reconciliation Act created the legislative basis for conducting Federal Monitoring Surveys (FMS).  Sections 1819(g)(3) and 1919(g)(3) of the Social Security Act require the Secretary to conduct Federal onsite surveys in a least five percent of a representative sample of skilled nursing facilities and in a representative sample of nursing homes in each State.

CMS intends to assemble a national team of surveyors who shall be available on both a scheduled and as-needed basis to: (1) conduct Federal Comparative surveys within two weeks to 30 days of a State survey to assess survey agency performance in the interpretation, application and enforcement of Federal requirements and conduct follow-up visits (with CO/RO discretion) and (2) respond/react in a timely and effective manner to crisis situations anywhere in the United States that endanger the health or safety of individuals in nursing homes.

Stage 1 will include the hiring the employees, training, establishing protocols, and other required programmatic activities; Stage 1 shall be completed within the first six (6) months of contract performance.

During Stage 2 the contractor will provide orientation and training for surveyors on CMS's survey policies and procedures, including investigative protocols to enhance surveyor's performance and understanding regarding the accurate application of the Long-Term Care (LTC) requirements.

In Stage 3 the contractor will conduct a series of surveys to train staff on the survey process and to evaluate the effectiveness of the survey team in conducting the process.  This may involve the participation of Regional and Central Office and contractor technical experts.  After a number of training surveys have been conducted, the contractor should recommend changes to the following: a) the methodology used to select and conduct surveys; b) the management of the administrative functions of surveying; and c) sampling methodology that will allow CMS to evaluate the effectiveness of state agency survey performance.  Additionally in Stage 3, the contractor will conduct a series of surveys that will be counted as part of CMS?s mandated workload that evaluates state agency survey performance.

Stage 4 requires that the contractor develop recommendations for revising the comparative survey methodology; deploy staff immediately for any crisis or complaint surveys; effectively utilize the data collected in stages 2, 3, and 4; and assist CMS in the development of training materials, policies procedures, and other required materials needed for Federal Monitoring Surveys (FMS) for the Project Officer.

The total period of performance of this contract is five (5) year.  It is estimated that the contractor will be required to conduct a maximum of 730 surveys over the year contract term.  Beyond the first year of contract performance it is estimated that the contractor will conduct approximately 170 surveys annually.  It is estimated that follow-up visit may be required for 60% of the facilities surveyed.  The contractor needs to develop and maintain communication and understand the interdependency of the Contracting Officer, Project Officer, CMS?s Central Office and its Regional Office Consortiums.

Some of the tasks the contractor selected will be expected to perform include:

	Ensuring the availability of qualified trained health professionals required to conduct the federal survey process on a national basis (registered nurses, medical doctors, pharmacists, dietitians, speech/occupational/physical therapists);
	Trained health Professionals must successfully complete CMS?s Long Term Care Basic Training and pass the Survey Minimum Qualifications Test
	Maintaining the skills and competencies of team members to ensure consistent application of the Long Term Care requirements;
	Coordinating survey findings and post-survey reports and materials to CMS?s Central and Regional Offices in a timely fashion; providing Regional Offices with all information necessary for enforcement action an serving as expert witness where necessary;
	Demonstrate to CMS the logistics of scheduling surveys throughout the US, developing and analyzing CMS data systems such as OSCAR and ASPEN, scheduling teleconferences, arranging travel plans multiple survey teams at long term care facilities across the country and other related activities;
	Providing a total Quality Assurance system to ensure consistency and accuracy across surveyors and surveys conducted throughout the country;
	Developing training material and policies and procedures and other materials as needed by the Project Officer.
	Propose to CMS how ?crisis? situations would be responded too including assembling a survey team on short notice anywhere in the US in order to assure the health or safety of our beneficiaries.
 


Key Personnel Requirements

The Project Manager must hold professional experience and education comparable to the masters level in health sciences, health policy or human services; have a least ten years of progressive management experience in a multi-tasked environment, have previous experience in working with or in a government regulatory environment, knowledge of the long term care survey and certification process, and currently engage, or be able to engage (through full or part-time employment or subcontract) within 45 days of the contract award, a pool of highly skilled, qualified and trained professionals in the field of long term care who are approved by CMS to conduct Federal comparative surveys and follow-up visits, complaint or special investigations or monitoring reviews and who can be deployed to crisis situations affecting the residents of long term care facilities.

<SUBJECT>A -- Organic  Polymeric Spintronics
<DESC>ORGANIC POLYMERIC SPINTRONICS WORKSHOP, SN03-12.  The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is sponsoring an information gathering workshop on Organic Polymeric Spintronics.  This workshop will be held April 14-15, 2003, at the Harbor Court Hotel, 550 Light Street, Baltimore, MD 21202.  Attendance at the workshop is OPTIONAL.  The goal of this workshop is to explore avenues for the development of the spin degree of freedom of the electron in addition to the charge in various organic and polymeric devices and to define all facets of the research necessary to continue the trend that was started in 1998 with the introduction of spintronic devices in magnetic storage and which is continuing currently with the development of semiconductor spintronics.  These new electronic and photonic devices will provide new paradigms of high speed, low power memory, logic and communication devices.  Organic and polymer electronics have been maturing as well and will also provide revolutionary low cost solutions to displays and eventually to memory and processing.  Science and technology that will develop the materials science and device technology necessary to combine these current directions to provide a series of organic spintronic devices like LED?s, FET?s, memory cells etc., paralleling the work in the more conventional semiconductors is solicited for informational purposes.  This advanced technology will enable the development of many new DOD systems that will significantly impact the DoD?s transformation goals across the board since revolutionary electronics can enhance our capabilities for sensing, characterizing, targeting and destroying enemy systems and weapons.  The workshop agenda will feature technology overview presentations by government personnel, invited speakers from the existing DARPA program and by the DARPA program managers.  Several poster session forums are part of this workshop, including summary overviews to facilitate interaction amongst the participants.  Participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters and five (5) minute summary overview presentations describing areas of capabilities and interest to facilitate communications, interactions, and team prospecting.  A short abstract of each poster presentation is required.  Please access the Organic Polymeric Spintronic website for workshop details including registration and abstract submission.  The website can be accessed at http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/view/Index.asp?meetingid=160.  The workshop registration fee is $150.00 and is inclusive of all workshop activities.  Registration cutoff is March 21st, 2003, or at attendance capacity.  Space is limited and it is recommended that you register early.  For further administrative information contact Jennifer K. Howell (jhowell@snap.org).  Please refer to the OPS Workshop in all correspondence.  This announcement is NOT a request for proposals.  No solicitation document is available at this time.  DARPA anticipates, but cannot guarantee, that a solicitation will follow the conference.
