<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for maintenance,modifications, and upgrades asnecessary to the Distress Alerting Satellite System (DASS) ground station located atGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD.  The DASS is based upon usage of the US AirForce's Global Positioning System constellation series of spacecraft.  The ground stationreceives distress signals relayed by several satellites and computes a location of thedistress beacon.  Potential tasks include maintenance and modifications to the groundprocessor station to keep it operating, to enhance capabilities, to increase accuracy ofthe data products, and to maintain state-of-the-art capability.  Also included in thisproposed contract is the management of diagnostic and repair/maintenance services for aset of 4 antennas, which track satellites and provide the resulting RF signals to thefiber optics link and then to the ground processor system.  NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole source procurement to Techno-Sciences, Inc. (TSI) 11750Beltsville Drive, Beltsville, MD 20705, for the maintenance, modification and upgrade tothe DASS ground station and management of associated antennas.	TSI is the vendor thatdesigned and built the ground processing portion of the DASS prototype ground station,and is the only vendor that has the design information sand software source code for thisprototype ground station.  While NASA has some rights in the vendor supplied stationsoftware, those rights do not extend to supplying it to another vendor for the purposesof competition.  To have another vendor try to duplicate this stations so it could learnto maintain it would be time and cost prohibitive.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon 15 February 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) plans to procure on a sole source basis the services of  CELand, 1909 Treetop Lane, Apt 13, Silver Spring, MD 20904-6621 for a high level, senior statistician with expertise in the epidemiology of radiation-related cancer risk, to support studies currently underway in the REB.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.

Period of Performance: Performance shall be for the base year of twelve (12) months from date of award with one (1) twelve (12) month option.

The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) conducts studies in the United States and abroad to quantify and clarify the role of ionizing radiation dose as a human cancer risk factor. Research projects are designed to broaden the database that supports the present highly quantified epidemiologic model of radiation carcinogenesis and its dependence on radiation dose, age at exposure, attained age and other factors, and its modification by genetic susceptibility and exposures to other agents like tobacco smoke. The REB is also concerned with implications of epidemiologic findings for public policy related to radiation protection in medical, environmental, and occupational settings. 

The contractor shall provide services that include leadership recommendations and extensive guidance and information on improvements and adaptations of the logic of the Interactive Radioepidemiological Program (IREP) developed by the REB in response to a Congressional mandate to update the 1985 NIH Radioepidemiological Tables used for adjudicating claims against the government for cancers possibly related to occupational exposures to radiation, and updating of former studies of radiation-related cancer.  The Contractor shall support REB Program Activities with work on several studies, including but not limited to 1) study of fallout-related radiation dose and thyroid nodule prevalence in Kazakhstan; 2) apply IREP logic to new population and exposure scenarios; and 3) study of radiation doses to populations in New Mexico affected by fallout from the Trinity atomic bomb test of 1945.  The contractor shall provide technical reports related to specific aspects of the studies and shall also provide quarterly reports that include summary description of the work done during the previous quarter.

CELand, LLC provides statistical and epidemiologic support for epidemiologic studies of radiation-related cancer risk in exposed populations, and is the employer of Charles E. Land, Ph.D.  Dr. Land possesses over 34 years of experience as a Health Statistician and Senior Investigator in radiation epidemiology. The REB requires Dr. Land’s expertise to identify potential study populations exposed to elevated levels of ionizing radiation, to quantify organ site-specific radiation dose at the individual or group level, and to evaluate radiation-related cancer risk as a function of dose and other factors, such as age, gender, or exposure to other agents, that may modify or interact with radiation dose response.  Given his extensive background, training, expertise, and in-depth experience with radioepidemiology, Dr. Land is uniquely qualified to meet the requirement of improving our understanding of the relationship between radiation dose and cancer risk, or a risk projection analysis to elucidate the likely exposure effect on the population, given our current knowledge of that relationship.

The contractor shall possess a Ph.D. in epidemiology/statistics or extensive related experience in conducting and analyzing data from complex case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies involving exposure assessment and risk analyses in populations exposed to ionizing radiation.  The radiation epidemiology statistician must have demonstrated strong skills in analyzing and interpreting epidemiologic data from case-control and cohort studies, and assessing their implications for radiation protection.

<DESC>RECOVERY: 

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research, Laboratory of Metabolism (LM) plans to procure one MICROLAB STARlet.

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions.  

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This is a 100 percent small business set aside.

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.

Delivery be one to two weeks upon receipt of award.

Contractor Requirements:  Contractor shall provide one Hamilton MICROLAB STARlet, parts and accessories, and software.

The instruments shall include the following characteristics as these are vital aspects to the NCI.

a)  Air Displacement Pipetting Channels: shall have air-displacement technology, which is analogous to a hand held electronic pipette. The benefits of this technology include the following:
• In combination with disposable tips, the risk of contamination of critical assays is reduced to an absolute minimum.
• High accuracy and precision from sub-microliter volumes to 1 ml can be reached with the same pipetting channels.
• No system liquid, diluters, valves or complicated tubing is required.
• No dilution effects of samples with system fluid.
• Each channel has a pressure monitoring system to monitor pipetting steps.

b)  Monitored Air Displacement (MAD): shall have air-based pipetting action, the instrument detects clots or empty wells during the aspiration step in real time. Thus monitored air displacement eliminates uncertainty in automated assays by providing reliable, consistent walk-away automation; shall have anti-droplet control (ADC) that compensates for pressure changes in the channels that are caused by the high vapor pressure of volatile solvents in real time. This allows accurate pipetting of highly volatile solvents that would otherwise prevent automation of assays involving robots for this purpose.

c)  Compression induced ‘O’ ring expansion (CORE) disposable technology: the CORE system attaches disposable tips to the pipetting channels by mechanically expanding an O-ring into a channel inside the tip. This enables a precision of ±0.1 mm on all axes with respect to the tip position during all pipetting steps. The system requires no vertical force for tip attachment or tip ejection, thus eliminating mechanical stress and improving the overall system reliability and reproducibility.  The CORE system also enables the user to confirm the size of the tip being used and also run a quick seal verification test, prior to each run to insure that O-ring integrity and seal are intact to avoid leaks during the course of the experiment.

d)  I-SWAP: an internal robotic gripping arm that can operate on the same arm as the pipetting channels.  This allows for a much larger working envelope than a separate arm system design. Since the I-SWAP inherently “knows” where everything is positioned on the deck based on the input method it saves user time in setting up methods or creating new ones. The I-SWAP also has grip detection system and can reach on both sides of the system deck allowing more flexibility and upgradeability for adding additional peripherals to the system.

e)  Liquid level detection shall offer 3 modes of liquid level detection:
• Capacitance Liquid Level Detection (CLLD) – each channel operates on its own frequency, minimizing the chances of false detection caused by interference.  This creates a more robust system and averts errors.
• Pressure Liquid Level Detection (PLLD) – each channel has its own pressure transducer and can monitor the pressure change in the tip to detect liquid.  This is used for non-ionic liquids and offers the user more control over all liquids pipetted by the system.
• CLLD & PLLD – the two modes of liquid level detection can be used in combination on any step and can provide true liquid extraction (LLE) functionality.

f)  96 tip pipette head - volume range of 1ul to 1mL.  Also offers CLLD on two channels for better reproducible pipetting performance.

g) Barcode reader- The auto loader barcode reader offers sample identification confirmation for all pipetting steps.  It also confirms the correct carriers and lab-ware based on the method the user is running and also offers a continuous feed option to increase the systems overall throughput.

h) Software shall offer an easy to use interface while still providing complete control over the system.  There are multiple wizards available to allow the user to quickly set up standard pipetting routines. The software shall offer an export package feature which assists remote access and troubleshooting by the vendor technical support.

Contractor shall be responsible for installation and training of this instrument.

Potential offerors may request a copy of the solicitation from Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax 301-402-4513.  If you have questions regarding this notice, they may be addressed to the aforementioned individual above.  

When submitting your request, please include complete mailing address, DUNS number, point of contact name, email address, phone and fax numbers.  Estimated issue date of the solicitation is February 16, 2010 with an estimated due date of March 1, 2010.

No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractor must be registered in and have valid certifications in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions Station Support Simplified Acquisitions Branch on behalf of the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate, on a noncompetitive basis, with University College of London, Research &amp; Development Office, 30 Guilford Street, London, WC1N 1EH, for support services to the NIMH's project titled "Developmental Amnesia and Verbal and orificial dyspraxia in children." This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.501 (a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 and the business size standard is $7.0 million. This is a firm fixed price acquisition. The period of performance is twelve months from award date plus three (3) one-year optional years. Place of performance is at the UCL in London.</p>
<p>The purpose of the proposed research is to study the differential roles of declarative and procedural memory in the acquisition of speech and language in patients with very early damage either to the hippocampal system in the medial temporal lobe or to the neostriatal system in the frontal lobe. Through comparison of these two patient groups, the NIMH researchers aim to dissociate the contributions made by the two implicated brain systems to auditory memory generally, and, more specifically, to cognitive-based vs. habit-based memory for speech and language.</p>
<p>Both of the neurodevelopmental disorders described above lead to disabling consequences: Early bilateral hippocampal pathology severely interferes with episodic memory, thereby causing debilitating long-term effects on education and employment and precluding independence during adult life, while the genetically based, bilateral neostriatal/frontal abnormality seriously affects the ability to communicate intelligibly and to process speech and language. Therefore, besides the need to better understand both the phenotype and neural basis of these two developmental disorders, an additional goal is to explore the utility of different remediation techniques that might be applicable to new young cases as they are discovered during the course of the investigations.</p>
<p>NIMH researchers has been in a long-standing collaboration with a team of investigators at the University College London (UCL), Institute of Child Health (ICH), and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (GOSH), where access to appropriate patient populations is available. The research will involve the application of neuropsychological, magnetic resonance, and electrophysiological techniques.</p>
<p>The contractor will perform the specific tasks including the following:</p>
<p>- Neuropsychological evaluations using both standardized as well as specially designed tests of auditory perception, auditory memory, and speech and language,<br />- Neuropathological evaluations with quantitative structural magnetic resonance techniques, and<br />- Neurophysiological evaluations with both functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological (event-related potential) techniques.</p>
<p>The specific design of each study will be worked out by the collaborative research team together with the UCL. The contractor will provide reports on research progress to the Principal Investigator (PI) on a biweekly basis by email, telephone, and fax as required. Onsite inspection will be performed by the PI on a bi-monthly basis. Day-to-day management will be directed by the Head of the Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience Unit, Dr. Faraneh Vargha-Khadem) at the ICH. Ethical approval for the studies will be obtained from the Ethical Committee Board at the ICH/GOSH.</p>
<p>To carry-out this proposed work elsewhere would require development of a new team of investigators and finding the appropriate patient populations that could take several years which will delay the on-going project and result in more costs to the government. A new team of investigators will need additional time to gain the knowledge of the ongoing project, the expertise and experience required to perform and complete the proposed work thus it will incur more cost to the government to complete the studies. University of College of London is the only vendor with unique expertise and experience to perform the ongoing collaboration. It is therefore considered cost effective and certainly most effective scientifically to have the work continually performed at ICH/GOSH.<br /><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the government will consider response submitted on or before 3:00 PM E.T., February 12, 2010 to Liem T Nguyen, ln18x@nih.gov. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the government to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTERS 2009 TASK ORDER CONTRACTORS.

State Health Policy Consortium

The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) was established as a matter of law within the Department of Health and Human Services by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and specifically Title XIII, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act.  ONC was directed by Congress to perform its duties “in a manner consistent with the development of a nationwide health information technology infrastructure that allows for the electronic use and exchange of information.”    

ARRA funding makes it possible to move ahead aggressively to support state and regional health information technology (HIT) developments by, among other initiatives, financing HIT Regional Extension Centers and state grants to promote HIT.  These efforts will build upon other ONC efforts to promote interstate cooperation, including the State Alliance for E-Health, the Health Information Security and Privacy Collaborative.

Because of these and other efforts some states are ready to work in regional collaboratives to exchange health information across state borders.  To do this, they must resolve privacy and security issues at a very concrete level, in practical terms.  This contract will support approved State Consortium Projects as they work to address and resolve the concrete problems that, without assistance, stand in the way of interstate exchange.  We cannot foresee all issues that may arise.  They may, however, include:

•	agreeing on the purposes for the exchange of information that will be enabled through the statewide exchange and the privacy policies related to those purposes;
•	agreeing on health information organization patient consent policies and designing common forms; 
•	developing model state privacy laws to facilitate interstate exchange within a region; 
•	developing a governance infrastructure or dispute resolution mechanism to resolve privacy and security issues as they arise within multi-state regional exchanges; 
•	addressing liability coverage for breaches of legal duties related to the privacy and security activities of interstate exchanges; 
•	developing software interfaces that connect different vendor software to facilitate auditing of compliance with privacy policies; and 
•	conducting demonstrations to test the privacy and security features of interstate exchange.    

The selected Contractor will support selected State Consortiums in the development and implementation of solutions to privacy and security issues preventing or impeding the interstate exchange of health information.  

The Contractor will issue one or more RFP(s), at the direction of ONC, over the length of the contract to solicit potential State Consortium Projects.  The Contractor will review proposed projects and present recommendations for ONC approval on which projects to select.  For projects suggested for approval the Contractor will include a proposed budget for the cost to the Contractor to support the project.  Once a State Consortium Project has been approved by ONC the Contractor, under the direction of ONC, will manage and support the project.  

Due to the open nature of this project, the Contractor must be very flexible, with the ability to access a wide range of staff, consultants, and expert resources to support identified State Consortium Projects, including but not limited to, the following:

•	Work closely with ONC to support regional, interstate projects that will further the development of a nationwide health information infrastructure;
•	Conduct policy assessment and analysis of state and federal issues related to health information technology in general and specifically the privacy and security of health information technology and health information exchange;
•	Provide, or access as needed, technical assistance and expertise on a wide range of issues related to interstate exchange of health information, including the ability to develop written materials and convene stakeholders;
•	Provide auxiliary and support services, including meeting planning, travel reimbursement, website support and production and distribution of publications; and
•	Understand federal and state privacy and security and other laws and regulations that impact health information technology and exchange.

A broad understanding of ONC's central initiative to advance appropriate and secure health information exchange, the State HIE Cooperative Agreement Program, is essential for the Contractor.  The State HIE Cooperative Agreement Program is providing funding to the 56 states and territories to develop and advance mechanisms for information sharing across the health care system.  The State HIE Program has identified five essential domains that states and territories will need to address in planning and implementing health information exchange:

•	Governance – This domain addresses the functions of convening health care stakeholders to create trust and consensus on an approach for statewide HIE and to provide oversight and accountability of HIE to protect the public interest. One of the primary purposes of a governance entity is to develop and maintain a multi-stakeholder process to ensure HIE among providers is in compliance with applicable policies and laws.
•	Finance - This domain encompasses the identification and management of financial resources necessary to fund health information exchange. This domain includes public and private financing for building HIE capacity and sustainability. This also includes but is not limited to pricing strategies, market research, public and private financing strategies, financial reporting, business planning, audits, and controls.
•	Technical Infrastructure – This domain includes the architecture, hardware, software, applications, network configurations and other technological aspects that physically enable the technical services for HIE in a secure and appropriate manner.
•	Business and Technical Operations – The activities in this domain include but are not limited to procurement, identifying requirements, process design, functionality development, project management, help desk, systems maintenance, change control, program evaluation, and reporting. Some of these activities and processes are the responsibility of the entity or entities that are implementing the technical services needed for health information exchange; there may be different models for distributing operational responsibilities.
•	Legal/Policy – The mechanisms and structures in this domain address legal and policy barriers and enablers related to the electronic use and exchange of health information. These mechanisms and structures include but are not limited to: policy frameworks, privacy and security requirements for system development and use, data sharing agreements, laws, regulations, and multi-state policy harmonization activities. The primary purpose of the legal/policy domain is to create a common set of rules to enable inter-organizational and eventually interstate health information exchange while protecting consumer interests.

The domains provide an overarching structure for planning and implementation of intra and inter state health information exchange.  As such, understanding the State HIE Cooperative Agreement Program is important to the Contractor’s ability to understand and manage interstate Consortium Projects under this contract.

<DESC><p>The United States General Services Administration seeks Expressions of Interest for Lease of Office and Related Space in Suburban Maryland.&nbsp; This requirement is for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which currently occupies office and related space in a campus of buildings under lease in Silver Spring, Maryland, that will be expiring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: The United States Government is seeking to lease approximately 986,000 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Rentable Square Feet of office and related space in no more than four buildings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LOCATION: The delineated area is Suburban Maryland, within 2,640 walkable linear feet of a metrorail station.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM: The proposed lease is for a 15-year firm term.</p>
<p>OCCUPANCY: The space must be available for occupancy by May 1, 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.&nbsp; The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.&nbsp; In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buildings offered for consideration must be of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as contemporary with the ability to meet all current applicable federal, state, and local government building codes and regulations including, but not limited to, fire and life safety, accessibility, OSHA, and seismic protection.</p>
<p>Owners, brokers or agents may offer space for consideration.&nbsp; Any properties submitted by brokers or agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized by the ownership to exclusively represent the building offered.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in this transaction.&nbsp; In no event shall a potential offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized offices and employees of the GSA or their authorized representative, CB Richard Ellis, Inc.</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest shall be submitted to the Government's Broker Representative at the following address:</p>
<p>Henry Chapman<br />CB Richard Ellis, Inc.<br />8270 Greensboro Drive, Suite 620<br />McLean, VA 22102<br />Henry.chapman@cbre.com<br />Telephone: 703-288-2565<br /><br />A copy shall also be sent to:<br />GSA National Capital Region<br />1099 14th Street, NW<br />Room 300 East<br />Washington, DC 20005<br />Attention: Brian MacDonald<br />&nbsp;<br />Expressions of interest should include the following information:</p>
<p>1. Building name, address, and age;<br />2. Location of space in the building and date of availability;<br />3. ANSI/BOMA office area/usable square feet (USF);<br />4. Rentable square feet (RSF) offered and rental rate per usable square foot, full service inclusive of a Tenant Improvement Allowance of $45.59/ANSI BOMA office area SF, meeting GSA's standard building shell requirements;<br />5. Name, address, telephone number, and email address of authorized contact;<br />6. Scaled floor plans (as-built) identifying offered space.<br />7. Information on project and building ownership.</p>
<p>The Government's decision regarding whether to consider relocating will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement. In the event that a potential offeror fails to provide specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the Government reserves the right to assume that the potential building in question cannot meet the Government's requirements.&nbsp; With specific respect to expected rental rate information, the Government will assume the maximum rental rate authorized in the applicable lease prospectus related to this requirement in the event the respondent fails to include such information.</p>
<p>Expressions of interest are due no later than 3:00 p.m. EST on February 16, 2010.&nbsp; Please reference Project Number 9MD2197.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States General Services Administration seeks Expressions of Interest for Lease of Office and Related Space in Suburban Maryland.&nbsp; This requirement is for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which currently occupies office and related space in a campus of buildings under lease in Silver Spring, Maryland, that will be expiring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: The United States Government is seeking to lease approximately 986,000 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Rentable Square Feet of office and related space in no more than four buildings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LOCATION: The delineated area is Suburban Maryland, within 2,640 walkable linear feet of a metrorail station.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM: The proposed lease is for a 15-year firm term.</p>
<p>OCCUPANCY: The space must be available for occupancy by May 1, 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.&nbsp; The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.&nbsp; In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buildings offered for consideration must be of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as contemporary with the ability to meet all current applicable federal, state, and local government building codes and regulations including, but not limited to, fire and life safety, accessibility, OSHA, and seismic protection.</p>
<p>Owners, brokers or agents may offer space for consideration.&nbsp; Any properties submitted by brokers or agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized by the ownership to exclusively represent the building offered.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in this transaction.&nbsp; In no event shall a potential offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized offices and employees of the GSA or their authorized representative, CB Richard Ellis, Inc.</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest shall be submitted to the Government's Broker Representative at the following address:</p>
<p>Henry Chapman<br />CB Richard Ellis, Inc.<br />8270 Greensboro Drive, Suite 620<br />McLean, VA 22102<br />Henry.chapman@cbre.com<br />Telephone: 703-288-2565</p>
<p>A copy shall also be sent to:<br />GSA National Capital Region<br />1099 14th Street, NW<br />Room 300 East<br />Washington, DC 20005<br />Attention: Brian MacDonald<br />&nbsp;<br />Expressions of interest should include the following information:</p>
<p>1. Building name, address, and age;<br />2. Location of space in the building and date of availability;<br />3. ANSI/BOMA office area/usable square feet (USF);<br />4. Rentable square feet (RSF) offered and rental rate per usable square foot, full service inclusive of a Tenant Improvement Allowance of $45.59/ANSI BOMA office area SF, meeting GSA's standard building shell requirements;<br />5. Name, address, telephone number, and email address of authorized contact;<br />6. Scaled floor plans (as-built) identifying offered space.<br />7. Information on project and building ownership.</p>
<p>The Government's decision regarding whether to consider relocating will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement. In the event that a potential offeror fails to provide specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the Government reserves the right to assume that the potential building in question cannot meet the Government's requirements.&nbsp; With specific respect to expected rental rate information, the Government will assume the maximum rental rate authorized in the applicable lease prospectus related to this requirement in the event the respondent fails to include such information.</p>
<p>Expressions of interest are due no later than 3:00 p.m. EST on February 16, 2010.&nbsp; Please reference Project Number 9MD2197.</p>

<DESC>This project will be for the removal of 10 diesel engine mufflers and 2 generator mufflers at Huxtable Pumping Plant and the replacement thereof with 2 stage catalytic converters.  The 10 pump engines are Fairbanks Morse 3600 horsepower engines driving storm water pumps.  The 2 515 Kw generators are powered by Caterpillar diesel engines.  The catalytic converters will be 2 stage, the first stage being a DOC (diesel oxidation converter) stage for the reduction of CO by 90%, and the second stage being an SCR ( selective catalytic reduction) for the reduction of NOx by 90%.  The SCR stage will use NX3 injection to reduce the NOx components.  The NX3 injection will be monitored and controlled by a sophisticated PLC control system using sensors mounted on the catalytic converter.  The controls will send signals to the NX3 flow valves which are responsible for accurately and constantly maintaining the proper ammonia flow rate so that the exhaust components never exceed allowable limits.  The system will use anhydrous ammonia for direct injection into the converters. This project will be an Unrestricted Procurement. For the purpose of this procurement to qualify as a small business concern, in addition to being independently owned and operated and not dominate in the field of operation in which it bidding on government contracts, the concern must have had average annual sales receipts of the preceding three years not exceeding $33.5 million.

A minimum of 18 operational end items are to be <BR>             repaired per year.<BR><BR>             TLOS:-(Description for information only); The TLOS, shown in  <BR>             Figure 1, is a passive (visual) and active (laser) target location <BR>             and observation system. In the passive mode, it is capable of <BR>             locating targets using a filtered and gated day/night I2 sight.<BR>             In the active (laser) mode, it is capable of locating optical<BR>             devices by using a 4X / 12X magnification I2 day/night sight <BR>             equipped with a Class III illumination laser. The TLOS enables <BR>             the search of special mission or high priority target areas. <BR><BR>             The TLOS can be used to aim the rifle with or without the <BR>             illumination laser. The TLOS Illuminator can also be used in the<BR>             momentary, quick flash mode to signal soldiers or pilots <BR>             (using night vision goggles) and/or illuminate night landing <BR>             zones for aircraft.  Used in the passive search mode without the<BR>             illumination laser, the TLOS can scan potential target<BR>             areas to detect or observe enemy positions. Field<BR>             magnification is selectable to either 4X WFOV or 12X<BR>             NFOV. Used in the active search mode with the illumination <BR>             laser, the TLOS can scan potential target areas in the 12X <BR>             NFOV to detect enemy optical threats through the illumination <BR>             laser optical augmentation return.<BR><BR>             The TLOS illuminator uses a laser beam to illuminate<BR>             the selected target area. The illumination laser is<BR>             invisible to the eye, but visible with night vision             <BR>             <BR>             The illuminator can provide field illumination either in quick flashes <BR>             to prevent detection, or in a continuous beam. The illuminator<BR>             control collar allows the operator to select beam size<BR>             anywhere from a narrow beam (collar full forward) to<BR>             a wide beam (collar full back). The maximum<BR>             effective detection range of the TLOS, with<BR>             illumination laser in narrow beam and sight in narrow<BR>             field of view, is 2 km in daylight and 3 km at night.<BR>          <BR>             This is not a request for proposals.  Interested contractors must<BR>             submit detailed information on past performance history to show<BR>             that the vendor has proven experience in TLOS repair. <BR><BR>             All interested parties must have the capability to fully calibrate <BR>             and test the TLOS system laser and optics modules. Government <BR>             Inspection and acceptance will be at the contractor's facilitie(s) <BR>             and all repairs will be according to OEM's proprietary drawing <BR>             number: 8209300.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY UNDER THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) PROGRAM.

THIS NOTICE IS ONLY FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES.</p>
<p>This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential vendors (including, but not limited to, small business (e.g. 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantage business, and women-owned small business)) that can produce the sample for the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) projects for up to 3 years.</p>
<p>The BRFSS is a state-based system of continuously collected health surveys. Established in 1984, the BRFSS is a collaborative effort between 50 states and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with program support from the Division of Behavioral Surveillance, Public Health Surveillance Program Office (proposed), Office of Surveillance, Epidemiology and Laboratory Services (formerly the Behavioral Surveillance Branch (BSB), Division of Adult and Community Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion). CDC provides cooperative agreement funds through CDC FOA DP-09-901 and DP09-902 to grantees for activities related to the data collection and survey implementation. Each state has a stand alone survey comprised of a core survey asked across ALL BRFSS sites, optional modules, and state added questions. The state projects are responsible for their state's respective data collection and accomplish this through either a contract to a marketing research company, a contract to a university based call center, or through their own health department in-house call center. The content of the BRFSS is jointly developed with input from CDC and state public health representatives. The BRFSS collects information on an annual basis concerning health risk behaviors, clinical preventive health practices, and health care access, primarily related to chronic disease and injury, but also includes other topics of public health significance such as immunization, mental health, and emerging issues. Data are obtained from a representative sample of non-institutionalized adults, age 18 years and older. Along with funding of the cooperative agreement, is the responsibility of DBS to provide the bank of phone numbers for a target sample in each site, provide data management activities including data receipt, cleaning, editing and reporting, applying appropriate weighting routines, and provide technical and analytical support to grantees and data users on all of the aforementioned topics.</p>
<p>For most states, the BRFSS is the only source for this type of information. BRFSS data are also increasingly being used by district, county, and city health officials to design health care programs, target and evaluation interventions, and inform policy makers and stakeholders of the current public health needs in their respective districts. BRFSS is a highly adaptable resource that generates high-quality data necessary to support public health education, promotion, and intervention programs.

SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE: 
RECOVERY - Hamilton MICROLAB STARlet Automated sample handling system 

Notice Number: 
SS-100004-2010-NG

Issued By:
National Cancer Institute (NCI), (http://www.nci.nih.gov)
Office of Acquisitions (OA)

Key Dates:
Capability Statement Due Date:  November 24, 2009

General Information:
This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

Purpose: 
The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small business concerns including 8(a), HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned business concerns that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.  

As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NCI may issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should  such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NCI’s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.


Description of Information to be included in the Capability Statement:
The following characteristics apply: 

a)  Air Displacement Pipetting Channels: shall have air-displacement technology, which is analogous to a hand held electronic pipette. The benefits of this technology include the following:
• In combination with disposable tips, the risk of contamination of critical assays is reduced to an absolute minimum.
• High accuracy and precision from sub-microliter volumes to 1 ml can be reached with the same pipetting channels.
• No system liquid, diluters, valves or complicated tubing is required.
• No dilution effects of samples with system fluid.
• Each channel has a pressure monitoring system to monitor pipetting steps.

b)  Monitored Air Displacement (MAD): shall have air-based pipetting action, the instrument detects clots or empty wells during the aspiration step in real time. Thus monitored air displacement eliminates uncertainty in automated assays by providing reliable, consistent walk-away automation; shall have anti-droplet control (ADC) that compensates for pressure changes in the channels that are caused by the high vapor pressure of volatile solvents in real time. This allows accurate pipetting of highly volatile solvents that would otherwise prevent automation of assays involving robots for this purpose.

c)  Compression induced ‘O’ ring expansion (CORE) disposable technology: the CORE system attaches disposable tips to the pipetting channels by mechanically expanding an O-ring into a channel inside the tip. This enables a precision of ±0.1 mm on all axes with respect to the tip position during all pipetting steps. The system requires no vertical force for tip attachment or tip ejection, thus eliminating mechanical stress and improving the overall system reliability and reproducibility.  The CORE system also enables the user to confirm the size of the tip being used and also run a quick seal verification test, prior to each run to insure that O-ring integrity and seal are intact to avoid leaks during the course of the experiment.

d)  I-SWAP: an internal robotic gripping arm that can operate on the same arm as the pipetting channels.  This allows for a much larger working envelope than a separate arm system design. Since the I-SWAP inherently “knows” where everything is positioned on the deck based on the input method it saves user time in setting up methods or creating new ones. The I-SWAP also has grip detection system and can reach on both sides of the system deck allowing more flexibility and upgradeability for adding additional peripherals to the system.

e)  Liquid level detection shall offer 3 modes of liquid level detection:
• Capacitance Liquid Level Detection (CLLD) – each channel operates on its own frequency, minimizing the chances of false detection caused by interference.  This creates a more robust system and averts errors.
• Pressure Liquid Level Detection (PLLD) – each channel has its own pressure transducer and can monitor the pressure change in the tip to detect liquid.  This is used for non-ionic liquids and offers the user more control over all liquids pipetted by the system.
• CLLD & PLLD – the two modes of liquid level detection can be used in combination on any step and can provide true liquid extraction (LLE) functionality.

f)  96 tip pipette head - volume range of 1ul to 1mL.  Also offers CLLD on two channels for better reproducible pipetting performance.

g)  Barcode reader- The auto loader barcode reader offers sample identification confirmation for all pipetting steps.  It also confirms the correct carriers and lab-ware based on the method the user is running and also offers a continuous feed option to increase the systems overall throughput.

h)  Software shall offer an easy to use interface while still providing complete control over the system.  There are multiple wizards available to allow the user to quickly set up standard pipetting routines. The software shall offer an export package feature which assists remote access and troubleshooting by the vendor technical support.

Dimensions: instrument shall be 44W x 36H x 32D.

NAICS Code and Size Standard:
In the event an RFQ is issued, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees is being considered.

How to Submit a Response:

Page Limitations:
Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement not to exceed 10 single sided pages including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc. (single space, 12 point font minimum) that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above.

Title:  From Concept to Reality: the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE)

Description:
This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) the type of small businesses, e.g., HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses, etc.; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS NOT CONSIDERED A SMALL BUSINESS UNDER THE APPLICABLE NAICS CODE SHOULD NOT SUBMIT A RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE.  This Sources Sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  

The NAICS code for this project is 541720.

The small business size standard is $7 million.

Background:
The NCI’s PRO-CTCAE system provides a web-based platform to collect patient reports of symptoms they are experiencing while undergoing treatment for the purposes of enhancing adverse event (AE) reporting (http://outcomes.cancer.gov/tools/pro-ctcae.html ).  The accurate reporting of AEs that occur to patients on clinical trials is a federal requirement that facilitates evaluation of new therapies. 

To date, 77 symptoms of the CTCAE (version 4) have been identified to be amendable to patient-reporting.  These symptoms have been converted to patient terms (e.g., CTCAE term “myalgia” converted to “aching muscles”).  For symptoms like fatigue and pain, the PRO-CTCAE system will ask patients information about symptom frequency, severity, and interference with usual activities. For other symptoms like rash, questions will focus on the presence on the body. These items have undergone extensive qualitative review among experts and patients.  The PRO-CTCAE electronic system will provide an interface for patients, investigators, and clinicians in a secure web-based platform.  The system is currently undergoing usability testing and a validation study is soon underway.

Purpose and Objectives:
The purpose of this project is to expand the capabilities of the current PRO-CTCAE system and to build a body of knowledge and evidence to support the implementation of the PRO-CTCAE system in multi-site clinical research studies supported by the NCI.  The three primary objectives of the contract are to: 1) increase accessibility of the PRO-CTCAE system for cancer patients and researchers; 2) conduct a feasibility study in NCI clinical trial networks; and 3) evaluate shared (patient-clinician) and stand-alone (patient only) models for symptom AE reporting.  

Project Requirements:

Enhance Accessibility of PRO-CTCAE System for Cancer Patients and Researchers
1) Translate the PRO-CTCAE items and instructions from English to Spanish (American dialect) and test for equivalence. 2) Enable home-based (non-clinic) assessment of the PRO-CTCAE system via secure electronic web-based platform. 3) Develop an interactive voice response system to allow patients to report their symptoms by phone. 4) Enhance the PRO-CTCAE system to upload and administer additional quality of life questionnaires.

Conduct Feasibility Study in NCI Clinical Trial Networks
Conduct feasibility study of the PRO-CTCAE system within NCI’s clinical trial networks with the goals to: 1) evaluate barriers to implementation and acceptance of the PRO-CTCAE at the individual site level (technical; logistical/workflow-related; training; cultural; financial), as well as any difficulties with sustained use of the system over time in trials; 2) estimate initial and ongoing costs associated with adopting PRO-CTCAE in a trial; 3) document clinicians’ responses to patient-reported adverse symptoms; and 4) assess patient and clinician satisfaction and valuation of the system and its output. 

Evaluate Shared (Patient-Clinician) and Stand-alone (patient only) Models for Symptom AE Reporting
Conduct a study comparing independent clinician and patient ratings with shared reporting to identify adverse symptoms that should be reported only by patients and symptoms that should be reported by both patients as well as clinician input.  In particular, the study will need to evaluate the impact of these different means of reporting upon CTCAE severity grading, alteration of treatment regimen and compliance with full course of therapy.

Anticipated Period of Performance:
The anticipated period of performance is a multi-year contract for 5 years starting around September 30, 2010.  

Capability Statement/Information Sought:
Small businesses that believe that they have the ability to satisfy all of the above stated Project Requirements, and who meet the stated size standard, are encouraged to submit a capability statement. The capability statements will be evaluated based on the information provided in relation to the Project Requirements and the current capacity to perform the work including: a) method and approach; b) staff availability, experience, and training; c) prior completed projects of a similar nature; and d) corporate experience and management capabilities.  On the first page of the capability statement, clearly state the small business concern’s size status and type(s), name, address, point of contact, and DUNS number. The remainder of the capability statement should be tailored to the project requirements stated above and must demonstrate that similar work has been performed in the past, including the dollar value of that work. 

Information Submission Instructions:
All capability statements sent in response to this SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via e-mail) to Virginia DeSeau, Contracting Officer, at vd9t@nih.gov, in either MS Word, WordPerfect or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by 3:00pm Eastern time on February 16, 2010.

<DESC>This is NOT a solicitation announcement. This is a Sources Sought Notice only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is for market research purposes to determine if capable, qualified small businesses (including Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, 8(a) firms, Small Disadvantage Business (SDB)) relative to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services (size standard of $7,000,000 in gross annual receipts or income as defined in 13 CFR ? 121.104) possess the capability to support EPA?s Regional Oversight Contract requirement.
Responses to this sources sought notice shall not constitute responses to any solicitation, which is not currently available. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.
The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government?s evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business designation (e.g. SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.).
DESCRIPTION
The intent of this notice is to request information from small business concerns in their efforts to provide technical support to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA?s) Office of Site Remediation and Restoration (OSRR) for EPA?s remedial oversight and enforcement activities.  
The EPA is seeking market research into whether capable small business sources are able to provide technical support to EPA in fulfillment of its responsibilities for oversight and enforcement of both CERCLA and RCRA activities at active, closed, or former Federal facilities, including Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) installations, Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS), and Formerly Used Site Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) sites. To a much lesser extent, any future awarded contract may also be used to provide technical support to EPA non-Federal potentially responsible party (PRP)-lead (i.e., privately-owned) sites.   
The comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), commonly referred to as ?Superfund,? was enacted in 1980 to provide U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with the necessary authorities to respond to releases of hazardous substances that have or might have occurred. CERCLA was amended in 1986 by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), and again in the 1992 by the Community Environmental Response Facilitation Act (CERFA). Additionally, EPA has the responsibility for assuring compliance with and corrective action under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Federal Facilities Compliance Act (FFCA) at all Federal facilities. RCRA was amended in 1986 by the Hazardous and solid waste Amendments (HSWA). (All references to CERCLA and RCRA in this Statement of Work (SOW) are meant to be inclusive of amendments.)
The U.S. government operates thousands of facilities across the country that promote the security and welfare of American Citizens, such as nuclear weapons plants, military bases, and fuel distribution stations. After years of vital service and operation, many of these Federal facilities are contaminated with military munitions, hazardous substances, hazardous waste, radioactive waste, and other toxic substances. 
To address the challenges posed by contamination at these facilities, the EPA works with the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), Department of ENERGY (DOE), and other Federal entities to develop solutions to their environmental problems. The mission of EPA?s Federal facilities program is to facilitate faster, more effective, and less costly cleanup and reuse of these properties. This is accomplished through numerous national and regional agreements governing the cleanup of Federal facilities, such as Interagency Agreements (IAGs), Federal facility Agreements (FFAs), settlement documents, and Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs), as well as applicable Federal, state, and local laws, regulations, guidance, and policies. 
ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT (LOE)The Government anticipates awarding an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a 5 year base period, and two (2), one (1) year award terms for a total maximum period of performance of 7 years.  The estimated level of effort for this requirement, in professional labor hours, is as follows:? 38,931 LOE hours for the base period.? 11,524 LOE hours for the two (2), one (1) year award terms.  ? Maximum potential LOE for all years is 50,455 hours with a maximum potential period of performance of 7 years.
CAPABILITY STATEMENT:
To help determine if this potential requirement may be set-aside for small business concerns, the government is seeking input from the small business community regarding their interest and capability in performing the tasks reflected in the draft SOW. The Government requests demonstration of capability by interested parties through submittal of capability statements. The government will evaluate the qualifications of interested parties based on their responses regarding capability of performing the draft SOW.
All capability statements must:
1. Not exceed and will be restricted to ten (10) single-sided pages in length.2. Be electronically submitted to the email address below by the stated deadline.3.

Human health and ecological risk assessments? Groundwater investigation and restoration? Remedial design and construction engineering? Geophysical experience on munition sites? Hydrogeological expertise5. List references as well as demonstrate experience in conducting projects of similar size,scope, and complexity in the past 5 years.6. State the (a) average number of employees of the concern; (b) average annual receiptsbased on the last 3 fiscal years; (c) other current business commitments (i.e., contracts,etc.); and (d) a description of the concern?s accounting system for estimating andaccumulating costs under cost-reimbursement contracts, and whether or not thosesystem(s) have been audited and/or approved by any Government agency.7. Demonstrate the management capability, corporate structure, and financial capability tomeet the needs of the anticipated level of effort and scope of this requirement. Note thatany resulting solicitation under set-aside procedures will include FAR 52.219-14Limitation on Subcontracting.
The Government intends to consider all comments and the responsive capability statements when developing its final acquisition strategy and resulting RFP(s). The synopsis, amendments and other information related to this sources sought as well as any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted on FedBizOpps and EPA's website, at:http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm., under the "Region 1, Regional Oversight Contract" link.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC), Chemical Biological Radiological (CBR) Technology Evaluation Branch, in support of the Chief, Chemical Biological Point Detection Branch, Edgewood Chemical Biological (CB) Center, is sponsoring in FY 2010 a Technology Readiness Evaluation (TRE) 10-1.  The TREs purpose is to evaluate advanced radiological detection technologies for the Joint Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Agent Water Monitor (JCBRAWM).   The TRE will consist of a Panel of subject matter experts for purposes of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) assignment.  The Government anticipates conducting a side by side test and evaluation of vendor systems in June 2010.<BR>Vendors both domestic and international are encouraged to respond to this RFI opportunity with details of hardware and data demonstrating a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 or higher.  Vendors are being sought that have a detection system capable of detecting radiological contamination in formulated tap water. <BR>This is not a Request for Proposal and no contract will be awarded as a result of this Request for Information (RFI).<BR><BR>Interested vendors should respond to this opportunity with descriptions of hardware and data that demonstrate the following: <BR><BR>1.  Performance (a.) performance capability to automatically detect  the presence of Alpha and Beta contamination in formulated tap water, (b.) 80 % probability of detection and a 10% false detection rate, (c.) detects contamination at two levels; 3 micro-Curies per Liter within 30 minutes  and 0.05 micro-Curies per liter within 50 minutes of Alpha and Beta contamination upon challenge presentation, (d.) set up and operational in ten (10) minutes or less (unpackaged configuration), (e.) and start up time and operational within one (1) minute upon operator initiation, after being non-operational for at least one (1) hour.<BR>2.  Suitability (a.) lightweight and man-portable, size of two (2) cubic feet or less and weight of 25 pounds or less, and (b.) easy to operate, maintain and is cost efficient.   (c.) In addition, include in your proposal descriptions of the size, weight, power requirements, sensitivity, limits of detection, technology employed, system maturity (technology readiness level), ease of operation and maintenance, operable with battery power (type) and length of time, audio and visual signals, and Built-In Test capability used.<BR>3.  Test:  A side by side test is planned and test duration will be approximately three (3) to four (4) weeks, during June 2010 at White Sands Missile Range Test Facility (U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command), White Sands, and New Mexico.  At this time there are two options open concerning the operation of the vendor systems:  1.) Either the vendors will operate their own system at White Sands Missile Range Test Facility for up to 4 weeks, or 2.) The Government personnel will operate vendor systems, preceded by sufficient hands-on training of Government personnel by the vendor. Vendors will provide operating instructions and/or manuals to Government personnel three (3) weeks prior to the Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI). <BR><BR>Vendors will be required to provide three (3) of their identical systems to test. The Operational Readiness Inspection, a preliminary test using known samples, will be conducted over one (1) or two (2) days prior to start of the formal test.  This will allow for adjustments to vendor systems with known isotopes.  No subsequent adjustments will be allowed.  The vendor systems will be tested with low concentrations of radiological contamination in formulated tap water. Vendors are advised that the Government does not warrant that all components of a vendors system will be 100 % decontaminated.  Therefore, those components or systems not decontaminated 100 % will be retained and destroyed by the laboratory.

(c)	CLIN 0003: Finley Flat capping piles with burnable water-repellent paper., 104 Acres
(d)	CLIN 0004: Camp Salvage slashing, 43 Acres


(VI) Detailed description of requirements is included in attached statement of work and exhibits.  The following is a general description of the services to be performed:

The objective of this project is to reduce hazardous fuels on National Forest System lands in order to lower the risk of catastrophic wild fire.  Fuels reduction will be accomplished through slashing and pre-commercial thinning treatments and hand piling of slash on approximately 147 acres in the Finley Flat area and the Camp Creek drainage, Sanders County, Montana.  

Finley Flat Thinning – The Contractor shall perform pre-commercial thinning of trees less then 6 inch dbh.  Species preference shall be given to ponderosa pine, western larch, western white pine, Douglas fir, lodgepole pine and grand fir. Seventy-five percent of the stand shall be thinned to an approximate 10-foot to 12-foot spacing (302-430 tpa).  Tighten to 6-foot spacing on the remaining 25 percent of the stand to maintain a clumping effect that will provide vertical screening between future campsites.  Clumps shall include from 3 to 12 trees.  Leave-trees need not always be the tallest trees.  Select varying heights to aid in screening campsites.  Remove all submerchantable conifers within 33 feet of live Aspen.  Thinned trees shall be cut below the lowest live limb except when prevented by natural obstacles.  All live limbs below the cutting point shall be removed.  Trees shall be completely severed from the stump.  Stump height shall not exceed 2 inches above ground level or 4 inches above natural obstacles.  Do not cut brush or hardwood species.  All conifer trees 12 inches high or taller not selected for a leave-tree shall be cut.  

Finley Flat Plot Inspections - The Contractor shall maintain a plot system that provides an unbiased sample of thinning quality, and that represents the entire area treated. The Contractor shall sample at least 1 percent of the treated area.  A 1/50th-acre plot size shall be used during inspection. The Contractor shall provide written inspection data, by unit, that meets requirements of the agreement, and a sketch map with plot locations.  To show compliance with the Contract specifications, 65-85 percent of the plots should result in 6-9 trees less than 6 inch dbh.  The remaining 15-35 percent of plots should reflect the tighter spaced clumps of trees and have 9-16 trees less than 6 inch dbh.

Finley Flat Piling of Slash - The Contractor shall hand pile pre-commercial thinning slash. The slash shall be piled so when it is burned, it will not damage residual leave-trees.  Hand piles shall be located 10 feet or more from individual and groups of live Aspens.  All piled material shall be placed parallel in the piles as much as practicable and constructed to facilitate full consumption when burned.  Minimum pile size shall be 4 feet high x 4 feet in diameter.  Maximum pile size shall be 10 feet high x 10 feet in diameter.  Approximately 10% of acreage will involve re-bunching of existing piles.

The Contractor shall cover piles with burnable water-repellent paper, provided by the Contractor. Paper shall be placed within the pile such that ¾ of the diameter of the pile is covered and held firmly in place by heavy slash on top of it.  The burnable water-repellent paper to be used for pile covering shall be approved in advance by the Contracting Officer.

Camp Salvage Slashing - The Contractor shall slash all species except western larch to facilitate future underburn.  Slash all conifers 5 inches dbh or less.  Slashed trees shall be cut below the lowest live limb except when prevented by natural obstacles.  All live limbs below the cutting point shall be removed.

(a)	The Government will award the contract to the offeror(s) who (a) asserts to the terms of the RFP, and (b) has the best combination of experience, past performance, and price.  Experience is a matter of the number of opportunities an offeror has had to do similar work and to encounter the kinds of problems that the Contractor is likely to encounter in the performance of this contract.  Past performance is a matter of an offeror’s reputation for integrity and customer satisfaction.  Quality control and the understanding of the work is a matter of the offeror’s familiarity with the nature of the work and with the kinds of problems the Contractor is likely to encounter during performance.  Award(s) may be made without further discussions.  Proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms, from a technical and cost standpoint, which the offeror can submit to the Government.  However, the Government may, after evaluation of the proposals, conduct further oral or written discussions as appropriate with all offerors whose proposals are within the competitive range.

(b)	Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical and price factors considered.

(c)	Each offeror’s proposal will be evaluated with respect to the past performance, technical, and price factors.  The non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.

(d)	Price will contribute significantly to the source selection decision and will be evaluated as to completeness, realism and reasonableness.  The importance of price will increase as the degree of technical merit differences between competing proposals decreases.  If technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in technical merit, price will become the determinative factor in making an award.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:PLEASE READ CAREFULLY: This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The U. S. Department of the Interior (DOI) Minerals Management Service (MMS) has a competitive requirement to investigate the effects and limitations of downhole commingling in regard to ultimate hydrocarbon recovery to be awarded to the offeror whose Quote gives evidence of the greatest value to the Government as outlined in this synopsis.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable and as supplemented with additional information included in the notice.  Solicitation number M10PS00168 is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-37 and the Department of Interior Acquisition Regulation (DIAR).  It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 entitled Engineering Services, with a small business size standard of $4.5M. QUOTATION PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS: To ensure timely and equitable evaluation of quotes, Offeror must comply with instructions contained herein. Quotes must be complete, self-sufficient, and respond directly to the requirements of this RFQ. The response shall consist of a technical and a cost/price quote. The Government anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price award as a result of this RFQ.  The Offeror shall prepare their quote in accordance with the Statement of Work and requirements below:OBJECTIVE: The Minerals Management Service (MMS), through the Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program intends to competitively award a contract to determine the effects and limitations of downhole commingling in regard to the ultimate recovery of hydrocarbons.  The study should address crossflow of reservoir fluids, the impact of reservoir drive mechanisms, and reliability of zone isolation methods.
SCOPE: 
The contractor shall present a summary of downhole commingling technologies and methods, and when each would be most suitable to use. Included in the summary will be the advantages and disadvantages of each method described in terms of economics and ultimate recovery.  A complete list of references used in the study shall be reported.A comprehensive review of case histories showing the historic failure rates and life expectancies of sliding sleeves and intelligent completions will be performed for both shallow water and deepwater applications. In addition, the contractor shall identify the effectiveness of zone isolation and flow control methods, and the risks associated with each.The probability of the occurrence of crossflow of fluids between commingled reservoirs will be determined.  The contractor shall also perform research to determine under what conditions, the crossflow of fluids will harm ultimate recovery.  A recommended maximum allowable pressure difference between reservoirs shall be provided in order to eliminate damage to ultimate recovery due to crossflow.  In addition, zone isolation assurance issues including when the prevention of crossflow should be enforced shall also be discussed.The contractor shall determine how the drive mechanisms of the individual reservoirs will affect the ultimate recovery in a commingled scenario, and if reservoirs with unlike drive mechanisms should be commingled.  The contractor shall also report the conditions under which premature water production from a water drive reservoir can harm ultimate recovery.The study will also determine if commingling vastly different reservoir sizes can impact ultimate recovery.  A recommended maximum reservoir size difference shall be reported if applicable.The analysis shall include the effects of various fluid characteristics, reservoir characteristics including relative reservoir depths and productive lives, and the relationship between cost and increased hydrocarbon recovery.  The reservoir fluid characteristics investigated should include commingling a gas reservoir with an oil reservoir and their relative positions to one another.  
The MMS will use the results of this study to assess the application of downhole commingling on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  
The Government anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price contract for this effort and offerors shall propose work by individual tasks including 1) Develop detailed work plan; 2) Hold kick-off teleconference or meeting with MMS staff at the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) Office in New Orleans, LA; 3) Perform background literature search; 4) Identify types and variations of downhole commingling methods and technologies; 5) Determine methods most practical for various reservoir scenarios; 6) Create risk profile and economic assessment for each; 7) Identify the effects of crossflow and reservoir drive mechanism on ultimate recovery; 8) Provide draft document; 9) Present draft findings to MMS staff at the GOM Office in New Orleans, LA; and 10) Provide final document to MMS.Any technical papers or publications written as a result of this research shall be made available to MMS for review and concurrence prior to their presentation and/or publication.
The Deliverable for this project shall be a Final Report.  For the final report, MMS requires five (5) paper hardbound copies and one reproducible copy.  The final report shall also be available in digital format; compatible with MS Office 2003.  The digital final report shall be submitted on CD in both .pdf and source code (i.e., MS Word).  The contractor shall present quarterly progress reports, final draft report, and final report.
The ESTIMATED BUDGET for this requirement is no greater than $100,000.00.
The projected PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE for this effort is no greater than 12 months from date of award.
The MMS SHALL RETAIN SOLE OWNERSHIP OF ALL DELIVERABLES.  The contractor shall vest all rights to the deliverables to the MMS at the conclusion of the project.  Please read this ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY as it constitutes the ONLY notice that will be issued.
FURTHER INFORMATION:  The work shall document, with references, all information presented.  All results stated need to be specific as to how the conclusions were determined and if they are, in fact, based on thorough and defendable engineering assessments and/or analyses of critical issues.  The information shall be presented in a format so that engineers and scientists can comprehend the results and resulting conclusions.  Also, the results and conclusions must be presented in a way so that they are useful, concise, and defendable to all concerned in making recommendations relative to the practice of downhole commingling of hydrocarbon reservoirs in the GOM.

<DESC><strong>To be eligible for Task Order award as a result of this RFP, Offerors MUST submit responsive proposals to BOTH this Task Order RFP as well as the Basic Ordering Agreement RFP No. S10-084 that may be found at www.fbo.gov. Offerors not receiving an award under the competitively issued BOA mentioned above WILL NOT be eligible for Task Order awards. Applicable terms and conditions for a Task Order resulting from this procurement are contained in both the Task Order document as well as the Basic Ordering Agreement.</strong> <br />
<p><br />The objective of this Task Order is to establish Tissue Source Sites (TSS) to provide human tissues for biomedical research, one of the two main initiatives for the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), a pilot project of the NIH Roadmap. This effort will be organized within the National Cancer Institute's (NCI cancer Human Biobank (caHUB) to whom the samples will be shipped for quality evaluation and use by the Laboratory component of GTEx.</p>
<p><br />OVERVIEW OF THE GTEX PROJECT</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />A Purpose of the GTEx Project</span></p>
<p><br />The GTEx project, a NIH Roadmap Initiative (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/GTEx/), aims to provide a resource to the scientific community with which to study the relationship between genetic variation and regulation of gene expression. This project will collect and analyze multiple human tissues from donors who will also be characterized for germline genetic variation through dense genotyping. By treating global RNA expression levels as quantitative traits, loci with polymorphisms that are highly correlated with variations in expression will be identified as expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs. The SNPs within the eQTL that are correlated with gene expression are sometimes called eSNPs. Based on analysis of individual tissues, 4% or more of gene transcripts have cis-eQTLs, operationally defined as an eSNP that is located close to the gene whose expression it is correlated with. To identify trans-eQTLs, in which the eSNP maps far from the gene or on a different chromosome from the gene it is regulating, much larger numbers of samples relative to cis-eQTLs, will be required to achieve a statistically significant association. This is due to the need to adjust for the large number of statistical tests involved in searching for correlation between expression levels of every transcript and a very large number of genetic variants. Comprehensive identification of both cis- and trans-eQTLs will provide a valuable basis on which to study gene regulation with an immediate application in interpreting GWAS study findings.</p>
<p><br />The GTEx project will begin with a 2.5-year, 3-phased pilot in FY10. As developed at a June 2008 GTEx Workshop (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/GTEx/workshop0608), the primary goal of the overall pilot is to assess the feasibility of enrolling 160 deceased donors identified through low post-mortem-interval (PMI) autopsy or organ/tissue transplant settings and collecting high-quality RNA from multiple tissues per donor. The precise number of tissues that yield high-quality RNA that can be collected from each donor is not known. The aim of this project is to collect as many different tissue types as is practical, ideally between 50 to 70, and to analyze gene expression in at least 50 tissues per donor.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared and processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This is a solicitation from the U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Acquisition Division - Kansas City Office. The requirement is for supplying and installing Collins APS-65 autopilot system in the NOAA Twin Otter aircraft, N56RF, Serial Number 788. The use of the brand name "Collins" product is essential to the Government's requirements, hereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. The Twin Otter N56RF aircraft is currently equipped with a Collins APS-106 while all of the other NOAA Twin Otter aircraft are equipped with the Collins APS-65 autopilot system. The installation of the Collins APS-65 on the Twin Otter aircraft N56RF will standardize all four of the NOAA Twin Otter's avionics and intercommunications systems so they are consistent from plane to plane. This has two main advantages; it will minimize the training and re-familiarization of the system for the pilots using the aircraft and also make it more efficient to repair and service the systems as the Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) can keep an inventory of parts that can be used by any one of the aircraft. This will ultimately save down time and provide a consistent flight deck that will minimize distraction for the pilots who frequently rotate between the Twin Otters. This notice constitutes the only Request for Quote (RFQ). Written offers are being requested. A hardcopy written RFQ will not be issued.
<p>DOC, Eastern Acquisition Division - Kansas City Office requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).

This shall repeat the indications that are shown on the unit's annunciators.</p>
<p>CLIN 0002 - Install the procured Collins APS-65 Autopilot system and integrate into the existing avionics suite in N56RF.</p>
<p>A. The system shall incorporate the Garmin GNS-530 #1 in both GPS and NAV (radio) modes.<br />B. The system shall operate in heading mode via a selector switch so that either pilot or copilot controls heading input with their respective Horizontal Situation Indicator (HIS) heading bug.<br />C. Any deviation from the installation in N56RF to the installation on the other NOAA DHC-6 aircraft must be addressed at the earliest opportunity and found acceptable by NOAA, AOC before the installation begins.</p>
<p>CLIN 0003 - Troubleshoot existing problems in the communications system on N56RF.</p>
<p>A. Isolate and repair ground reception clarity problems experienced with the Satellite phone system.<br />B. Isolate and repair connectivity problems experienced with cabin headset connection box.<br />C. Isolate and repair problem of #1 and #2 VHF radios interfering with each other when transmitting.</p>
<p>CLIN 0004 - Over-and-Above Parts and Labor.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for documenting and reporting, at intervals acceptable to the AOC Contact Point, all discrepancies found during the required course of work on N56RF. Discrepancies that are not a part of the required course of work will be known as "over and above." Corrective actions are considered "over and above" items. Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life, but fails inspection and needs to be replaced, is considered an "over and above" item.<br /><br />"Over and Above" discrepancy report must include (as a minimum):<br />- Description of each discrepancy found;<br />- Number of person-hours per discipline required to complete each discrepancy;<br />- Hourly rate for personnel performing the work;<br />- Parts cost less the percentage discount, if any;<br />- Total dollar amount for the complete list of discrepancies.<br /><br />The AOC Contact Point will be responsible for reviewing the list of "over and above" discrepancies and making a recommendation to the Contracting Officer, to either accept or decline the Contractor's proposal. The Contractor shall not proceed with correcting any "over and above" discrepancies without prior approval from the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall bill all charges for "over and above" items on a separate invoice at the conclusion of repairs.<br /><br />Funds for the "over and above" items will be specified at the time of award and included in CLIN 0004. The dollar amount stated in the contract represents an estimated total, not to exceed amount to cover charges for the "over and above". The Government will pay invoices for "over and above" services out of the funds allocated and authorized on CLIN 0004. This paragraph applies only to CLIN 0004. It is not possible prior to contract award to accurately estimate the extent and duration of work or to anticipate costs for CLIN 0004 with any reasonable degree of confidence. Time and materials provide for acquiring these services on the basis of direct labor hours and cost of materials.<br /><br />Direct labor hours are at specified fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit. Cost of materials includes appropriate material handling cost as part of material costs. The price to be paid for material shall be based on an established catalog or list price in effect when material or other product is furnished, less all applicable discounts to the Government. In no event shall the price exceed the Contractor's sales price to its most favored customer for the same item in like quantity, or the current market price, whichever is lower.</p>
<p>Insurance: The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain during the performance of this work, Hull &amp; Liability (Hangar Keepers) insurance in the amount of at least $3,000,000. The policies evidencing required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective:<br />o For such a period as the laws of the State in which this work is to be performed prescribe; or <br />o Until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the Contracting Officer, whichever is longer.</p>
<p>Warranty: The Contractor shall provide warranty documents from parts manufacturers/overhaulers for the parts used as well as provide a warranty on the labor and installation of the components.</p>
<p>FAA Certification: Contractor must provide proof of being a FAA Certified Avionics Repair Station.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: NOAA AOC would like to have this work completed no later than January 31, 2011. The aircraft operational schedule allows for a limited timeframe for the work to be completed and the aircraft will not be available until after October 31, 2010.<br /><br />The compatibility of the aircraft's operational commitments with the Contractor's proposed timelines will be evaluated. Should Contractors need to inspect N56RF prior to contract award or before work is started on the aircraft, inspection personnel will need to travel to the plane's location and travel costs incurred will be at the Contractor's expense. Due to potentially long lead times, all parts and materials should be procured as soon as possible after award. Once parts are procured, the Contractor and NOAA AOC will coordinate the best time for the installation.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria: The Contractor shall provide quotes that include all associated costs, including parts and labor. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to evaluate offers.</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - Technical</p>
<p>A. Provide proof of being a FAA Certified Avionics Repair Station.</p>
<p>B. Provide proof of having experience in doing this kind of installation. More consideration will be given to contractors who have experience with the DeHavilland DHC-6.</p>
<p>C. Provide documentation on how often and how recently similar work as been completed.</p>
<p>D. Provide information about work shifts available in a 24-hour period as well as work days available in a week.</p>
<p>E. Provide information about level of technical support available after installation; response to problems, warranty work, malfunctions, capability for on-site repairs and handling trouble calls.</p>
<p>F. Submit a proposed timeframe in which the work will be completed. The timeframe shall include, but not be limited to the following information:</p>
<p>a) Proposed time of initial aircraft inspection-start and end dates.<br />b) Proposed time of equipment acquisition and engineering (aircraft not required on site)-start and end dates.<br />c) Proposed time of installation (aircraft required on site)-start and end dates.<br />d) Proposed time of final system inspection/quality assurance-start and end dates.</p>
<p>G. Provide location of where the work will be completed. More consideration will be given for a location closer to Monterey, CA because it lessens the time for AOC to get to and from the Contractor's facility.</p>
<p>H. Provide proof of required insurance documentation or ability to acquire the required insurance.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - Past Performance</p>
<p>Must submit up to three references for recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items (include contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information).</p>
<p>Technical and past performance when combined, are slightly more important than price. As the technical ratings become more equal, price becomes more important. Conversely, as price proposals become more equal to one another, technical proposals will become a more important determining factor. NOAA will evaluate the offeror's proposed prices for fairness and reasonableness in relation to the solicitation's requirements. Overall, the proposal selected will be the one that provides the best-value to the Government.</p>
<p>Place of Performance: All installation work will be performed at the Contractor's facility.</p>
<p>Wage Determination: This action is covered under the Service contract Act of the U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee working under this action must be paid no less than the Wage &amp; Hour rates applicable to the geographical location of the Contractor's facility. The Service Contract Act (SCA) Wage Determinations (WD) are available on the internet website: http://www.wdol.gov/. The applicable Wage Determination will be incorporated at the time of award.</p>
<p>Delivery Requirements: A Government flight crew shall fly the aircraft to the Contractor's facility. The period of performance shall not exceed the timeframe specified. If requested, all scheduled events and required services will be brought to the Contractor's attention.<br />Government Property: Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government if requested. The cost of shipping the returnables shall be the responsibility of the Government.<br />Quality Assurance: NOAA/AOC may desire to have a representative witness any part of the work performed under this Contract. The Contractor shall keep the AOC Contact Point apprised of the progress and schedule. NOAA shall have access to the aircraft throughout the term of this Contract. NOAA will provide an authorized AOC representative to be present for test flight and final acceptance.</p>

To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation.

Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)

<DESC>I. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as an invitation to Request for Quotations (RFQ) incorporates provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38. This is total small business set-aside procurement. The Small Business size standard is 1,000 employees. The NAICS is 336611. The contract will be awarded in accordance with provisions of FAR 13.5. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protestor essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: Solicitation/Contract number, Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, and Solicitation Closing Date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protestors must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protestor's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protestor may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protest in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half Street, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593. Telephone: (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904. This intent of this project is to dry-dock and repairs of the CGC SPAR located at Kodiak, AK in accordance with the following requirements.

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Washington, DC</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>DCHA/OTI is an exciting, fast-paced, operational office in USAID. Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that OTI PSC staff is deployed expeditiously and programs started quickly, often with little or no lead time. This is a key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations. It is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support. To achieve this, OTI requires a Personnel and Operations Assistant who has the capacity to work well within a team environment and anticipate the needs of a complex organizational unit.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

<p>The Applicant Rating System is as Follows:<br />Evaluation Factors have been assigned the following points:<br />Factor #1 - 20 <br />Factor #2 - 20 <br />Factor #3 - 15<br />Factor #4 - 15 <br />Factor #5 - 10</p>
<p>Total Possible - 80 Points</p>

<p>Applications must be received by the closing date and time at the address specified in the cover letter.</p>
<p>NOTE: Applicants must review their experience/education against the required minimum qualifications for the GS-7 and GS-9 positions carefully. Applicants must submit a separate application for each position for which they wish to be considered. In most cases, this would simply require a small change to the cover page (e.g., indicating an application for the GS-7 or GS-9 position). Applicants must be cautious: those who submit an application for the GS-9 grade level, but do not meet the minimum qualifications as outlined in this solicitation and as reviewed by the Technical Evaluation Panel (TEC) will not be considered for the GS-7 position if they have not submitted a separate application for that level. Similarly, applicants who apply for only the GS-7 position even though they might meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-9 position will not be considered for the higher graded position if they have not submitted a separate application for each. Applicants who are unsure of which grade level they meet the minimum qualifications should submit a separate application for each grade level.</p>

<p>1. A complete U.S. Government Optional Form 612 with hand-written signature (including OF-612 continuation sheets as needed) (downloadable forms are available on the USAID website, http://www.usaid.gov/forms, or internet http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do, or www.globalcorps.com).</p>
<p>NOTE: Submission of a resume in addition to the required forms is encouraged, but submission of a resume alone or in lieu of the OF-612 form IS NOT a complete application. All information to be evaluated must be contained in the OF-612 form and must not depend on references to your resume. Failure to provide the required information and/or materials will result in your not being considered for employment.</p>
<p>All applicants must submit complete dates (months/years) and hours per week for all positions listed on the OF-612 or on supplemental OF-612 continuation sheets to allow for adequate evaluation of your direct and related experience. Experience that cannot be quantified will not be counted towards meeting the solicitation requirements.</p>
<p>Dates (months/years) and locations for all field experience must also be detailed.</p>
<p>2. A supplemental document specifically addressing: <br />Each of the Education/Experience requirements shown in the solicitation.<br />Each of the five (5) Evaluation Factors shown in the solicitation.</p>
<p>To ensure consideration of applications for the intended position, please reference the solicitation number on your application, and as the subject line in any cover letter.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. <br />For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. <br />For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly: <br />-Contract and/or Delivery Order Number <br />-CAGE Code <br />-Issue Date <br />-Issue By DoDAAC <br />-Admin DoDAAC <br />-Inspect By DoDAAC <br />-Service Acceptor DODAAC <br />-Ship To Code (DoDAAC or CAGE Code) <br />-Local Processing Office (LPO) DoDAAC*<br />-Pay DoDAAC</p>

<DESC>(I)This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). Submit written proposals on RFQ Number AG-82B1-S-09-0050.

(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33.

(IV) This solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 115310, Support Activities for Forestry. The small business size standard is $7 Million.

(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item/services:

(a)	CLIN 0001: Finley Flat pre-commercial thinning, 104 Acres
(b)	CLIN 0002: Finley Flat hand piling slash, 104 Acres
(c)	CLIN 0003: Finley Flat capping piles with burnable water-repellent paper., 104 Acres
(d)	CLIN 0004: Camp Salvage slashing, 43 Acres


(VI) Detailed description of requirements is included in attached statement of work and exhibits.  The following is a general description of the services to be performed:

The objective of this project is to reduce hazardous fuels on National Forest System lands in order to lower the risk of catastrophic wild fire.  Fuels reduction will be accomplished through slashing and pre-commercial thinning treatments and hand piling of slash on approximately 147 acres in the Finley Flat area and the Camp Creek drainage, Sanders County, Montana.  

Finley Flat Thinning – The Contractor shall perform pre-commercial thinning of trees less then 6 inch dbh.  Species preference shall be given to ponderosa pine, western larch, western white pine, Douglas fir, lodgepole pine and grand fir. Seventy-five percent of the stand shall be thinned to an approximate 10-foot to 12-foot spacing (302-430 tpa).  Tighten to 6-foot spacing on the remaining 25 percent of the stand to maintain a clumping effect that will provide vertical screening between future campsites.  Clumps shall include from 3 to 12 trees.  Leave-trees need not always be the tallest trees.  Select varying heights to aid in screening campsites.  Remove all submerchantable conifers within 33 feet of live Aspen.  Thinned trees shall be cut below the lowest live limb except when prevented by natural obstacles.  All live limbs below the cutting point shall be removed.  Trees shall be completely severed from the stump.  Stump height shall not exceed 2 inches above ground level or 4 inches above natural obstacles.  Do not cut brush or hardwood species.  All conifer trees 12 inches high or taller not selected for a leave-tree shall be cut.  

Finley Flat Plot Inspections - The Contractor shall maintain a plot system that provides an unbiased sample of thinning quality, and that represents the entire area treated. The Contractor shall sample at least 1 percent of the treated area.  A 1/50th-acre plot size shall be used during inspection. The Contractor shall provide written inspection data, by unit, that meets requirements of the agreement, and a sketch map with plot locations.  To show compliance with the Contract specifications, 65-85 percent of the plots should result in 6-9 trees less than 6 inch dbh.  The remaining 15-35 percent of plots should reflect the tighter spaced clumps of trees and have 9-16 trees less than 6 inch dbh.

Finley Flat Piling of Slash - The Contractor shall hand pile pre-commercial thinning slash. The slash shall be piled so when it is burned, it will not damage residual leave-trees.  Hand piles shall be located 10 feet or more from individual and groups of live Aspens.  All piled material shall be placed parallel in the piles as much as practicable and constructed to facilitate full consumption when burned.  Minimum pile size shall be 4 feet high x 4 feet in diameter.  Maximum pile size shall be 10 feet high x 10 feet in diameter.  Approximately 10% of acreage will involve re-bunching of existing piles.

The Contractor shall cover piles with burnable water-repellent paper, provided by the Contractor. Paper shall be placed within the pile such that ¾ of the diameter of the pile is covered and held firmly in place by heavy slash on top of it.  The burnable water-repellent paper to be used for pile covering shall be approved in advance by the Contracting Officer.

Camp Salvage Slashing - The Contractor shall slash all species except western larch to facilitate future underburn.  Slash all conifers 5 inches dbh or less.  Slashed trees shall be cut below the lowest live limb except when prevented by natural obstacles.  All live limbs below the cutting point shall be removed.  Trees must be completely severed from the stump.  Stump height shall not exceed 8 inches above ground level or 4 inches above natural obstacles.  Lop all created slash to within 12” of the ground.

Camp Salvage Plot Inspections - The Contractor shall maintain a plot system that provides an unbiased sample of slashing quality, and that represents the entire area treated. The Contractor shall sample at least 1 percent of the treated area.  A 1/50th-acre plot size shall be used during inspection.  The Contractor shall provide written inspection data, by unit, that meets requirements of the agreement, and a sketch map with plot locations.  To show compliance with the Contract specifications, 90 percent of the plots should show no trees less than 5 inches dbh other than western larch.  

(VII) Date(s) and place(s) of delivery and acceptance: The project is located in two separate areas of the Plains/Thompson Falls Ranger District.  

The first project area is 104 acres in the Finley Flat area, located in Sections 27 and 34, Township 23 North, Range 30 West, P.M.M.  Access Finley Flat from Mt. Highway 200 approximately 9 miles northwest of Thompson Falls, Montana.

The second project area is 43 acres in Camp Creek.  To access Camp Creek, travel approximately one mile west of Thompson Falls, turn southeast on Prospect Highway #7,  then turn on NFSR #352 and go approximately 11 miles to a unit located in the NE ¼ of Section 22, T.20N., R.29W. and the NW ¼ of Section 23, T.20N., R.29W., P.M.M.

Project areas are former cutting units.  Unit boundaries will be delineated with flagging by the Forest Service. 

Period of Performance:  All work shall be completed by September 30, 2010.

(VIII) FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (June 2008), applies to this acquisition. See Addendum for additional instructions.

(IX) Offers will be evaluated on their past performance, their technical capability to successfully complete this project, and the price quoted. 

(a)	The Government will award the contract to the offeror(s) who (a) asserts to the terms of the RFP, and (b) has the best combination of experience, past performance, and price.  Experience is a matter of the number of opportunities an offeror has had to do similar work and to encounter the kinds of problems that the Contractor is likely to encounter in the performance of this contract.  Past performance is a matter of an offeror’s reputation for integrity and customer satisfaction.  Quality control and the understanding of the work is a matter of the offeror’s familiarity with the nature of the work and with the kinds of problems the Contractor is likely to encounter during performance.  Award(s) may be made without further discussions.  Proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms, from a technical and cost standpoint, which the offeror can submit to the Government.  However, the Government may, after evaluation of the proposals, conduct further oral or written discussions as appropriate with all offerors whose proposals are within the competitive range.

(b)	Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical and price factors considered.

(c)	Each offeror’s proposal will be evaluated with respect to the past performance, technical, and price factors.  The non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.

(d)	Price will contribute significantly to the source selection decision and will be evaluated as to completeness, realism and reasonableness.  The importance of price will increase as the degree of technical merit differences between competing proposals decreases.  If technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in technical merit, price will become the determinative factor in making an award.

(X) The offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (June 2009), with its quote or complete the Representations and Certifications on line at HTTP://ORCA.BPN.GOV .

<span style="COLOR: black">REQUEST FOR PRICE QUOTES</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Price Quotes are requested for a one-year renewal support agreement for RealSecure Network software maintenance.</p>
<p>The existing maintenance service expired on 29 October 2009. Price Quotes should include reinstatement fees if applicable.</p>
<p>A justification for specific make and model is listed below.</p>
<p>The part numbers, quantities and estimated costs for this purchase are reflected below: <br /><br />IBM Part # Qty # of Users<br />RNE-1-PB-M 1 13<br />RNE-1-PB-M 1 8</p>
<p>OCN: 347553 and 347554<br /><br /><br />The software maintenance agreement will be initially delivered to the following Fairfax, Virginia location:</p>
<p>Raytheon Inc, H98291 (EBOM 1728)<br />4601 N. Fairfax Drive, Suite 711 Attn: Paul Foresta<br />Arlington, VA 22203-1524</p>
<p><br />The purchase of this one-year renewal maintenance support for RealSecure Network software maintenance is needed to support the Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System Global Counter-Terrorism Force and Multinational Coalition Forces Iraq (CENTRIX-GCTF/MCFI) services. A justification for specific make and model is attached for reference. This maintenance agreement will provide needed software updates necessary to maintain the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />SPECIFIC MAKE AND MODEL</p>
<p><br />Description of Action(s):</p>
<p>The purpose of this effort is to purchase a one-year renewal maintenance agreement for RealSecure Network software. This acquisition is in support of Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange System Global Counter-Terrorism Force and Multinational Coalition Forces Iraq (CENTRIX-GCTF/MCFI) services. This maintenance agreement will provide needed software updates necessary to maintain the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The products and quantities required for this RealSecure Network software maintenance are:</p>
<p>Part number RNE-1-PB-M, quantity of 1 (includes 13 users) <br /><br />Part number RNE-1-PB-M, quantity of 1 (includes 8 users).</p>
<p>The manufacture of this software is IBM.</p>
<p>Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications: The specific make and model required is already accredited in the facility. A change in the product would mean modifying engineering drawings, changing accreditation paperwork and require re-approval from the Designated Approval Authority (DAA), causing a detrimental delay in operation. The specific make and model was tested extensively such that a confidence factor of 100% is assigned to the probability of this product's integration into the over-riding system. The product is required to ensure the timely update of the intrusion detection system's signatures. If the selected specific make and model is not purchased, signatures can not be updated and the latest security threats can not be detected. The purchase of this specific make and model is more economical than purchasing a different brand that would require the system to be retested and approved.</p>
<p>Abandoning this software would significantly increase the cost and time it would take to convert to a new software. Selecting alternative software products would require the PMO to incur a minimum of 12 months of development effort and an estimated additional program cost (excluding new COTS licensing costs) to develop, integrate, test, secure, and maintain a replacement for this software.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to respond to disasters around the world on behalf of the U.S. Government (USG), DCHA/OFDA projects itself overseas in a variety of ways. First, DCHA/OFDA maintains six permanent regional offices and one sub-regional office in the following locations: San Jose, Costa Rica; Bangkok, Thailand; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; Pretoria, South Africa; Almaty, Kazakhstan; and Budapest, Hungary. Second, in countries where DCHA/OFDA has a large humanitarian response portfolio, it establishes a Program Office (currently eight) within the USAID Mission or U.S. Embassy. Third, in the event of major disasters, DCHA/OFDA may deploy a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to the affected country.</p>
<p>The Overseas Administration Team (OAT) is part of the Operations Division. It was created to meet the need for administrative support and intervention as OFDA's presence in the field grew following the opening of these regional and program offices. As more staff were permanently deployed to support emergency programs in Africa and Asia, OAT's role in administrative intervention prior to and following deployment of staff has become more significant. OFDA now has 16 locations in the field that are directly supported by OAT. The team consists of four members: the Administrative Officer for Field Operations (as the Team Leader), two Administrative Support Coordinators, and an Administrative Support Assistant.</p>
<p>In 1999, OFDA instituted a program of contracted personal services contractors (PSCs) who could provide short term, on-call assistance to the office as the need arose. This program, called the Support Relief Group (SRG), has grown from an initial group of 12 to a potential pool of up to 75 contractors. The management of this program is part of the OAT portfolio.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of an Administrative Support Coordinator (ASC) who will provide administrative support to OFDA overseas operations at USAID Missions and Embassies worldwide. The ASC will also support the surge capacity program (SRG). The incumbent will report to the Administrative Officer for Field Operations and backstop the other Administrative Support Coordinator.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The ASC will:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide administrative support to OFDA overseas operations. Support will include assisting overseas staff to resolve administrative issues; interpreting policies and regulations; negotiating with missions and embassies, and other types of support for overseas operations.

<p>&bull; Perform miscellaneous administrative tasks such as working with Agency's financial and acquisition and assistance systems and with OFDA's financial planning system, as well as the updating of data in the SRG database as required;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>I. Description<br /><br />The Air&nbsp;Armament Center Capabilities Integration Directorate Division AAC/XR is requesting information and/or&nbsp;innovative concepts for developing an airborne capability to remotely mark vehicles for identification purposes. A near-term technology is sought for fast implementation; therefore, mature technologies are preferred. Respondent information will be used by the Government to determine the most promising approaches to standoff (line of sight) "tagging," sensing and tracking of the tag, and the art of the possible in meeting desired qualities described below. Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to determine corporate interest in demonstrating such systems. From the responses to this RFI, the Air Force will determine the feasibility of hosting demonstrations at Eglin Air Force Base in late summer 2010 and developing a possible acquisition strategy.
<p>Innovative technologies are sought such as hyperspectral and laser or a combination of both for tagging, sensing and tracking to satisfy the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Effectiveness: Tags should be readily applied day or night to a variety of commercial or other targeted vehicles, moving and/or stationary and from a host aircraft at a distance of approx. 5 km or greater, and be easily recognized from similar distances.</p>
<p>2. Persistence: Tags should be capable of being sensed and tracked for at least a few hours duration, with a goal of a few days.</p>
<p>3. Inconspicuous: An ideal tag will be unobservable to the unaided eye, but readily detected with a sensor from an airborne platform similar to the one tagging or from a ground sensor.</p>
<p>4. Unique ID: An ideal tag will allow the user to distinguish among multiple similar vehicles with tags, i.e. a different identifiable tag for each.</p>
<p>5. Date/Time: An ideal tag will include a time stamp and/or expiration feature which will allow some idea of the age of a tag under observation, to allow the observer to easily recognize and disregard an old tag which has outlived its usefulness.</p>
<p>6. Platform Compatibility: The tagging system must be compatible with carriage on relatively slow-moving (propeller-driven) aircraft or UAV's. Ideally the tagging system could be easily integrated into the current sensor suite of the platform. Respondents should provide some estimate of the size, volume and weight of proposed systems. Consideration should be given as to how the system would be integrated should it affect the air/flightworthiness and safety of the airframe.</p>
<p>7. Maturity: Any level of maturity will be considered; however, please indicate if the system is available within the next few months for a tower demonstration. Indicate when the technology would be available for military use.</p>
<p>Additionally, the following information is requested (if available) to enable the Government to better evaluate the maturity and effectiveness of the proposed tagging technology:</p>
<p>1. Weather: Provide tagging sensing and tracking capabilities in an all weather environment and identify atmospheric restrictions in rain, fog, and cloud cover.<br />2. Military Utility: Any weaponization analysis/studies of the tagging technology and potential concepts of employment to show performance, effectiveness, and military utility.<br />3. Reliability/Maintainability: Any data on tagging technology reliability and maintainability issues and their potential solutions.</p>
<p>II. Government Information<br /><br />THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. This RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered as a Request for Proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs of charges by the Government will arise due to contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information.</p>
<p>AAC/XR uses service contractors in fulfilling its mission requirements, including the review of the technology capabilities solicited in this RFI. Service contracts contain an organizational conflict of interest clause that requires service contractors to protect the data, and prohibits them from using the data for any other purpose than for which it was presented.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this contemplated effort. The information you provide may be utilized by the Department of Defense in developing its acquisition strategy, including creation of Initial Capabilities Documents.</p>
<p>Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately. Any subsequent actions resulting from the evaluation of the information provided because of this RFI, may be synopsized at a future date. If synopsized, information detailing the specific requirements of this procurement(s) will be included.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI may be classified at the TOP SECRET level or below. Classified responses should be properly marked and packaged. For instructions on submitting classified information contact: Ms Christine Wicker at Christine.Wicker@eglin.af.mil or (850) 883-4925.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), and should not be construed as such a commitment by the U.S. Government. All information contained in this RFI is preliminary, and subject to modification.</p>
<p>III. Responses<br /><br />Responses should include information about all relevant and applicable unclassified technologies available within the aforementioned timeframes and based on requested criteria. They should include information about the type of material, hazard classification, physical properties, etc., as described in requirement criteria.</p>

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 "Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aer! onautical, and Nautical System and Instrument manufacturing" applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 750 employees. Interested sources are encouraged to first register as a source on the PIXS Web Site (www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).  All parties are asked to provide a telephone number, an e-mail address, and a facsimile number in their response. Information marked "Proprietary" will be protected and will not be divulged unless mandated by existing laws. This information should be sent to ASC/647th AESS /PK, 2145 Monahan Way, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433 not later than (15) fifteen calendar days from the publication of this notice.  The PCO shall be the sole POC for any and all communication regarding this acquisition: Kimberly Henderson, (937) 255-7682, email kimberly.henderson@wpafb.af.mil.  
Update: ASC 647 AESS ATP-SE IDIQ TASK ORDER CONTRACT DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this update is to reiterate to industry that information about the pending source selection, requirements for ATP-SE, or any other discussions pertaining to the ATP-SE that may occur with industry shall not be considered a requirement or direction unless that information has originated from the PCO, Mr. Robert Hixenbaugh. The ATP-SE team has been made aware of communication between the user and a contractor that may have related perceived requirements specifically "non-developmental ATP-SE system procured as a result of this sources sought synopsis will require a single OFP" This is not a currently planned requirement.  All future requirements for ATP-SE will be released to all potential Offerors through the PCO. If any Offeror believes they have received direction or guidance on the upcoming program it is incumbent upon them to disregard that information/not act upon that information if it has not come from the PCO. This announcement does not relieve the potential offerors from the previous request for submitting the capabilities statements on or before the 16 May deadline.This is not a request for proposal and no response is required.    The PCO shall be the sole POC for any and all communication regarding this acquisition: Kimberly Henderson, (937) 255-7682, email kimberly.henderson@wpafb.af.mil.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the Federal Business Opportunity (“FedBizOpps” or “FBO”) system, vendors must:

•  Be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  

•  Verify your CCR registration within the FBO system
    o  Once logged into the FBO system, go to the “MyProfile” tab  
    o  Click on the “Company Information” sub-tab
    o  Click on the “Register DUNS” button
    o  Enter DUNS number and select “Proceed and Review”

•  Once registered, go to the FBO website and log in.  Click on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD2345 - Military Critical Technical Data Agreement Form.  Fill out the DD2345 form and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U. S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form. JCP will return an approved and signed certified form within 5 days of receipt.  Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect.  Additionally, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.
   o  The CS/Vendors can check the following website to ensure their JCP status:   http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/search.aspx

•  Once you receive the MPIN, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link.  The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN. 
    o  The MPIN number is a mandatory data element created by the CCR registrant and must have nine characters: at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number. No spaces or special characters are permitted. It allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also serves as a validation to access sensitive but unclassified documents associated with a notice posted to FedBizOpps.
    o  How to Look up an MPIN 
       &#61607;  Go to the CCR Homepage: www.ccr.gov
       &#61607;  Enter the user ID and password, then click the "Log In" button. 
       &#61607;  Select "View" across from the DUNS number you are looking for. 
       &#61607;  Scroll to the bottom of the Points of Contact to view the associated MPIN.  

•  Following verification of the MPIN, vendors will submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the “Request Explicit Access” button.  Once vendors request explicit access, the FBO system will send notification to the DESC personnel assigned to the procurement, who will approve the request in the system.  Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DESC.  
    o  If a request for explicit access was previously submitted, and is pending review, the vendor will see a designation that explicit access was previously submitted.
    o  If a request for explicit access was previously submitted, and granted, the vendor will see designation that explicit access was previously granted.
    o  If you have not received notification from the FBO system that you have received explicit access, please contact the POCs assigned to the procurement you are interested in.  

•  Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system, and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.  



Some important notes to keep in mind:

Vendors MUST allow sufficient time for the submission and processing of the DD2345 request.  Requests for extension of closing/due dates based upon lack of access to secured documents will not generally be considered without evidence of timely DD2345 submission.  

DLIS does not correlate a particular DD2345 to a specific procurement or to DESC.  Your DLIS certification will be valid until the expiration date listed in block 7c of the DD2345, and can be used for any procurement in the FBO system.  

For any additional questions, there is a user guide for vendors located under the “Getting Started” tab of the FBO website.  Information regarding access to secured documents can be found starting on page 44 of the Vendor user guide.

a)	Socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SEDB) expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.b)	Service-disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB) and responsible, competitive offers from theprevious tier.c)       Very small businesses and responsible, competitive offers from previous tiers.d)       Small businesses and responsible, competitive offers from previous tiers.e)       Other-than small businesses and responsible, competitive offers from previous tiers.

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to obtain crew carrier buses as defined in the solicitation, for local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents.  We anticipate issuing the solicitation within 15 days of the date of this notice.  The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services.  This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system and to use VIPR, you must have access to a computer and the internet.  Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.

User guides and other information regarding VIPR are posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vipr.php.

In addition to the basic requirements referred to above, there are two very important things you must do in order to submit an offer utilizing the VIPR system:
  
1) Download Formatta Filler software to be able to view the solicitation package and complete the online forms used in submitting your offer.  A link to this software and installation instructions are available at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.php.
 
2) Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication.   Users play a key role in ensuring that information requested for VIPR is protected.  The government now requires a higher level of security for information transmitted by individuals to the government for electronic business (including that conducted by VIPR).  Therefore, the Forest Service requires secure user accounts through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Level 2 eAuthentication system.  Only individuals from your company who plan to sign the preseason incident agreement(s) must obtain a Level 2 eAuthentication account.  The Level 2 credentials go beyond simply applying for an account online - Level 2 also ensures that your identity is verified in-person, and by doing so, helps prevent identity theft or fraud.   The Forest Service has prepared numerous resources to assist vendors in obtaining a Level 2 eAuthentication account, which are posted to the Forest Service Incident Procurement (IP) website:  http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.

<DESC><p>PROCUREMENT OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>This Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) is being solicited to identify a pool of qualified candidates for BOA award to facilitate contracting for future work in support of both The Cancer Human Biobank (caHUB) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx). It is intended that multiple BOA awards will be made so that future Task Orders may be competed among the pool of qualified BOA holders.</p>
<p>Offerors responding to this Request for Proposal (RFP) are also encouraged to respond to RFP No. S10-120 for Biospecimen Acquisition and Quality Assessment Operations in Support of GTEx that is also currently posted to www.fbo.gov. RFP No. S10-120 represents the first Task Order issued under the umbrella of this BOA.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute is expanding funding of basic and translational research programs that rely heavily on the sufficient availability of high quality biospecimens and associated data suitable for use in its research programs.</p>
<p>The Cancer Human Biobank (caHUB, http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/cahub/) is a targeted effort to establish a centralized, world class cancer tissue resource, Pathology Resource Center, and associated infrastructure. caHUB has a mission to accelerate biomedical and translational cancer research by ensuring the adequate and continuous supply of high-quality, highly annotated human biospecimens. caHUB will create a collection of diseased and normal biospecimens to support a broad range of scientific needs. caHUB will support collaborative research combining the power of multiple analytical platforms and technologies across the same set of highly qualified and characterized biospecimens. With caHUB and the research and development that caHUB will support, the NCI's overarching goal is to improve the ability to diagnose, prognosticate, treat, develop new and novel therapeutics, and prevent cancer.</p>
<p>Normal human tissues are essential to the study of cancer and other diseases. The National Institutes of Health's Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, a NIH Roadmap initiative (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/GTEx/), aims to provide a resource to the scientific community with which to study the relationship between genetic variation and regulation of gene expression. This project will analyze multiple human tissues from donors who will also be characterized for germline genetic variation through dense genotyping. caHUB will acquire normal tissues for the GTEx project through contracts with organizations such as rapid autopsy programs, organ and tissue transplant programs, surgical tissue procurement programs, and medical examiner programs.</p>
<p>This Request for Proposal (RFP) is to solicit technical capabilities responses from entities that have the ability to serve as a Tissue Source Site (TSS), providing clinically annotated normal human biospecimens to caHUB and GTEx.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To meet caHUB and GTEx project goals, SAIC-F will award one or more Basic Ordering Agreements to organizations capable of accruing and delivering targeted normal biospecimens and their associated clinical data. The biospecimens and data will be delivered to caHUB for quality control, extensive pathology characterization, diagnostic verification, processing into molecular analytes, storage, other relevant processes, and distribution for qualified research and development.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that organizations providing technical capabilities proposals in response to this solicitation may include, among others:<br /><br />&bull; Dedicated Rapid Autopsy Programs<br />&bull; Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs)<br />&bull; Tissue Recovery Organizations (TROs)<br />&bull; Medical Examiners<br />&bull; Surgical Tissue Procurement Programs</p>

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	Could you please tell me how to obtain a Form-330 (Architect/Engineer Qualifications) to complete and submit in for VISN 1?A template of the Standard Form 330 can be found at this link http://www.cfm.va.gov/contract/ae.asp, and was also posted in the second to last paragraph of the presolicitation on FBO.2.	In regard to VISN 1 Architect and Engineering IDIQ Solicitation # VA-776-10-RP-0115 - Will this work be strictly for energy projects as outlined in the description? Or will it include clinical work as well? The main priority of the NEBC and this particular AE IDIQ is for all types of Energy projects at the medical facilities located in VISN 1.  All of the projects that would occur under this IDIQ would be energy related.  I do not anticipate there being any clinical work that did not involve an energy related project.  3.	I am writing to request any and all documents related to solicitation VA-776-10-RP-0115. Should I also fill out the information on the Fed Biz website under "interested vendor list'?There are not any other documents to the presolicitation that was posted on FBO.  We are only asking for Standard Form 330 statement of qualifications.  It is your option whether or not to fill out the interested vendor list.4.	Do the submissions need a team that can address all the listed A/E services; namely "geothermal, co-generation, bio-mass, solar photovoltaic, wind turbine, utility metering, retro-commissioning, LEED EB, renewable energy, feasibility studies, energy efficiency, water conservation, and greening of the government projects"? Or can a submission to you identify an area of expertise and limit the proposal to that service area?We are asking for firms that submit to be able to cover all of the criteria that is listed on the presolicitation.  How you achieve this is entirely up to your firm.  A submission should not just highlight your expertise or ask for the proposal to be limited to that service area.5.	I'd like to request a copy of the RFP for "Architecture and engineering services for an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for A/E design services for multiple A/E disciplines for VA facilities". There are 21 presolicitations posted on Federal Business Opportunities, fbo.gov, that were posted by the VA National Energy Business Center (NEBC).  The presolicitation number for VISN 1 is VA-776-10-RP-0115, and if you do a search for this on FBO you should find the presolicitation.  6.	If we are selected to do the design work, will we have the opportunity to either continue as construction manager or will it prevents us from the much larger back-end piece?Your firm obviously can respond to this solicitation, but a design firm cannot bid on a follow-on construction project.  This includes the subs that were on the design team.7.	 Section H instructions- #5, #6, and #7- All of these sections refer to projects that were listed in Part 19 of the SF330.  Part 19 is the resumes of the personnel. Was this meant to say Part 20 which is the project section? It would be very difficult to provide this information for projects that employees worked on that were with a different firm specifically the amount of change orders, design philosophy, etc.  Obviously this information would be available for the 10 projects that we would be showcasing in Section 20. You are correct with what you have pointed out.  Go ahead and list the projects from Part 20 and not 19.  8.	I noticed that one of the items mentioned was asbestos and lead surveys.  Will VA contract directly with an env consultant for these services, or will VA contract with an Architect who will then subcontract an env consultant to do the lead/asb survey?The VA is looking for a team primed by an Architect under NAICS 541310 or Engineer 541330, to meet all the criteria and disciplines listed in the presolicitation.  We will not be looking to contract directly with an environmental consultant for these IDIQ's.9.	Is this IDIQ open to both architects and engineers as prime or do you have a preference for architects only as the prime?This IDIQ is open for both Architect and Engineers to be the prime, under NAICS code 541310 which was listed and 541330 Engineering Services.  Just make sure an architect is included in the team and the criterion listed in the presolicitation is followed.10.	We are interested in submitting on all network areas ranging from VISN1 to VISN 23 for Architect and Engineering work. It appears that the RFP package is similar for each VISN with the exception of geography. In lieu of submitting 21 packages, is it acceptable to submit one package that would cover the all of the VISN areas?  I understand from your end the idea of submitting just one SF330 indicating your interest in all 21 VISN locations.  However, from my standpoint that would be very difficult to track during the evaluations stage and to determine whether your firm had a branch or main office located within 100 miles of one of the medical center locations in each VISN.  So if you are interested in submitting an SF 330 for each VISN, I would like to see 21 separate SF330's or whatever the amount you are interested in.  This may seem like extra work, but this will make the evaluations go much smoother for the VA. 11.	Separate announcements were issued for over 20 individual VISNs.  If our firm wants to submit SF330 information for more than one VISN, can one SF330 be submitted with an indication of the VISNs we are proposing to support, or will a separate SF330 be required for each VISN?Since there are 21 VISN's and 21 presolicitations I would have to say I will take one SF330 for each individual VISN.  If you are interested in three VISN's then I would want to see three separate SF330's.  I am not trying to cause more work, but I am doing this from a logistical and tracking sense so I will be able to distribute everything accordingly.12.	The announcements indicate a requirement that the responder have an office within 100 miles of at least one of the facilities identified in the respective VISN.  If the response includes a prime with a strategic Team of subcontractors, does the office have to be an office for the prime, or can it be an office for a Team member?The prime vendor must be within 100 miles of one of the VISN facilities listed in the presolicitation.  There will be a question and answer modification to follow on FBO with an answer to this question for all to see. 13.	So that we can identify the distance of our office locations relative to your facilities, are VISN maps in vector file format (i.e., Illustrator, either AI or EPS file) available that show the location of your facilities?This link will provide a map and links to each VISN for the specific locations: http://www1.va.gov/caresdecision/page.cfm?pg=31.14.	Will preference be given to SDVOSB led A/E teams compared to teams with SDVOSB participation but not SDVOSB led?The only preference that will be given is if there are enough qualified SDVOSB firms that submit SF330's, and then as stated in the presolicitation, the government has the right to set-aside to an SDVOSB or to a VOSB.  There will not be any special consideration for SDVOSB subcontractors.15.	Do all the consultants on a team need to be within 100 miles of a VISN listed hospital?  Additionally, do all of the consultants need to be within 100miles of the same hospital?  The prime firm needs to have either their main office or a branch office within 100 miles of one of the medical facilities listed on the presolicitation.  The consultants do not have to be within 100 miles of the same hospital.  16.	I notice that the due dates for both solicitations is February 15th - President's Day. Will this date remain valid, or will the next amendment reflect a different due date?The date has been changed to February 16, 2010, and the last day for Technical Questions has been changed to February 9.  These changes were posted on FBO on January 27, 2010.17.	Part 10 of Section H in the RFP requests interested firms to "identify any and all litigation involvement over the last ten years and its outcomes".  To clarify, does this request pertain only to the prime contractor or the prime contractor and their sub-contractors?The insurance and litigation over the past ten years pertains only to the prime.  The sub contractors are under your control, as they are part of your team.

These changes were posted on FBO on January 27, 2010.3.	Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.  We just wanted to see more than the traditional ten projects that are listed in section F.  4.	Will a linked single pdf of our submission suffice or do you need the native files all zipped together?  Or shall we just zip the single pdf for you?It is acceptable to zip all the files together or zip as a single pdf.  5.	We are interested in submitting on all network areas ranging from VISN1 to VISN 23 for Architect and Engineering work.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	In the text it mentions the Small Business Size Standard is $4.50 million gross annual revenue but on the side it says no set aside. Do we need to be a small business to submit?The posting does mention the Small Business Size Standard, and also mentions that if enough qualifications are received the government reserves the right to make this a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-Aside.  Again that is only if enough qualified firms submit.  We encourage all types of firms to submit for this AE IDIQ.  2.	My question is whether the VA prefers that these proposals be led by an Architect or whether we as engineers can prime? The NAICS code listed in FBO was 541310 which is for Architectural Services, but an Engineering Firm under NAICS Code 541330 can also submit as the prime firm, as long as there is an architect on the team and the criteria listed in the presolicitation is followed.  3.	Can you send me the RFP for submittal to your organization.This is not an RFP, but a request for your firm to submit Standard Form 330 statement of qualifications.  This is not a solicitation.  Please follow FAR 36.6 Architect and Engineering, to better understand how we are following AE and Brooks Act procedures for this procurement.  4.	Can you please tell me if the above referenced RFQ is a small business set aside?The presolicitation that you referenced is not a small business set-aside.  However, if there are enough qualified Service Disabled or Veteran Owned firms that submit their SF330's then the Government reserves the right to make this an SDVOSB or VOSB set-aside.  5.	We are reviewing the presolicitation are wondering if the Response Date was still February 15, 2010, as it is a Federal Holiday.The date has been changed to February 16, 2010, and the last day for Technical Questions has been changed to February 9.  These changes were posted on FBO on January 27, 2010.6.	The solicitation seems to indicate that you will be selecting one firm for an extensive area.  If that is so could you direct me to the larger firms bidding on the job so that I can find sub contracting opportunities?  If not please let me know if we can submit our qualifications for the New Jersey area alone?I cannot direct you to a list of firms who are bidding on this job, as there is no list available and we are just asking for SF 330's statement of qualifications from interested firms.  There is an interested parties listed on FBO you can check, and see if there are firms on there who are looking for subs.  This presolicitation is asking for firms who can provide AE services to the entire VISN 3 area, and not just the state of New Jersey.  7.	Will our partner's SDVOSB status help meet potential set-asides should you elect to set-aside this work to SDVOSB firms?The SDVOSB status will not help as a sub.8.	Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.  We just wanted to see more than the traditional ten projects that are listed in section F.  9.	Do all the consultants on a team need to be within 100 miles of a VISN listed hospital?  Additionally, do all of the consultants need to be within 100miles of the same hospital?  The prime firm needs to have either their main office or a branch office within 100 miles of one of the medical facilities listed on the presolicitation.  The consultants do not have to be within 100 miles of the same hospital.  10.	Separate announcements were issued for over 20 individual VISNs.  If our firm wants to submit SF330 information for more than one VISN, can one SF330 be submitted with an indication of the VISNs we are proposing to support, or will a separate SF330 be required for each VISN?Since there are 21 VISN's and 21 presolicitations I would have to say I will take one SF330 for each individual VISN.

I am not trying to cause more work, but I am doing this from a logistical and tracking sense so I will be able to distribute everything accordingly.11.	So that we can identify the distance of our office locations relative to your facilities, are VISN maps in vector file format (i.e., Illustrator, either AI or EPS file) available that show the location of your facilities?This link will provide a map and links to each VISN for the specific locations: http://www1.va.gov/caresdecision/page.cfm?pg=31.

Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	Is this a small business set aside? The summary column at the right indicates "Set Aside: N/A" however, the text cites a "Small Business Standard" of $4.5 million.This is not a small business set-aside and any size business can submit.  However, the Small Business Standard is in here due to this line in the presolicitation:  If acceptable SF-330 packages are received from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) firms, the government reserves the right to set aside this procurement for SDVOSB or VOSB, or conduct discussions with the highest qualified SDVOSB or VOSB firms.2.	My question is whether the VA prefers that these proposals be led by an Architect or whether we as engineers can prime? The NAICS code listed in FBO was 541310 which is for Architectural Services, but an Engineering Firm under NAICS Code 541330 can also submit as the prime firm, as long as there is an architect on the team and the criteria listed in the presolicitation is followed.  3.

Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.  We just wanted to see more than the traditional ten projects that are listed in section F.  6.	Do all the consultants on a team need to be within 100 miles of a VISN listed hospital?  Additionally, do all of the consultants need to be within 100miles of the same hospital?  The prime firm needs to have either their main office or a branch office within 100 miles of one of the medical facilities listed on the presolicitation.  The consultants do not have to be within 100 miles of the same hospital.  7.	Separate announcements were issued for over 20 individual VISNs.  If our firm wants to submit SF330 information for more than one VISN, can one SF330 be submitted with an indication of the VISNs we are proposing to support, or will a separate SF330 be required for each VISN?Since there are 21 VISN's and 21 presolicitations I would have to say I will take one SF330 for each individual VISN.  If you are interested in three VISN's then I would want to see three separate SF330's.  I am not trying to cause more work, but I am doing this from a logistical and tracking sense so I will be able to distribute everything accordingly.8.	The announcements indicate a requirement that the responder have an office within 100 miles of at least one of the facilities identified in the respective VISN.  If the response includes a prime with a strategic Team of subcontractors, does the office have to be an office for the prime, or can it be an office for a Team member?The prime vendor must be within 100 miles of one of the VISN facilities listed in the presolicitation.  There will be a question and answer modification to follow on FBO with an answer to this question for all to see. 9.	So that we can identify the distance of our office locations relative to your facilities, are VISN maps in vector file format (i.e., Illustrator, either AI or EPS file) available that show the location of your facilities?This link will provide a map and links to each VISN for the specific locations: http://www1.va.gov/caresdecision/page.cfm?pg=31.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	Can you please send me a copy of the RFP for VISN 5 AE IDIQ - VA-776-10-RP-0119?This is not an RFP, but a request for your firm to submit Standard Form 330 statement of qualifications.  This is not a solicitation.  Please follow FAR 36.6 Architect and Engineering, to better understand how we are following AE and Brooks Act procedures for this procurement.2.	The RFP is for VISN 5 which includes MD, VA, DC and WV; however the RFP only lists specific facilities within MD.  The RFP notes that the A/E team must be "fully A/E qualified and licensed in those states to be considered."  My assumption is that the RFP was only noting some of the facilities and that you must indeed be registered in all the jurisdictions.  Could you please confirm this?  Site Resources is not registered in all the jurisdictions.  Would it be acceptable to immediately seek reciprocity licenses in the jurisdictions we are not licensed in or do the licenses have to be in place when the proposal is submitted? You must be licensed, however if the firm is licensed in Maryland, they can stamp drawings at Federal facilities in Virginia or other states. 3.	Will our partner's SDVOSB status help meet potential set-asides should you elect to set-aside this work to SDVOSB firms?The SDVOSB status will not help as a sub.4.	Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.  We just wanted to see more than the traditional ten projects that are listed in section F.  5.	Do all the consultants on a team need to be within 100 miles of a VISN listed hospital?  Additionally, do all of the consultants need to be within 100miles of the same hospital?  The prime firm needs to have either their main office or a branch office within 100 miles of one of the medical facilities listed on the presolicitation.  The consultants do not have to be within 100 miles of the same hospital.  6.	Separate announcements were issued for over 20 individual VISNs.  If our firm wants to submit SF330 information for more than one VISN, can one SF330 be submitted with an indication of the VISNs we are proposing to support, or will a separate SF330 be required for each VISN?Since there are 21 VISN's and 21 presolicitations I would have to say I will take one SF330 for each individual VISN.  If you are interested in three VISN's then I would want to see three separate SF330's.  I am not trying to cause more work, but I am doing this from a logistical and tracking sense so I will be able to distribute everything accordingly.7.	The announcements indicate a requirement that the responder have an office within 100 miles of at least one of the facilities identified in the respective VISN.  If the response includes a prime with a strategic Team of subcontractors, does the office have to be an office for the prime, or can it be an office for a Team member?The prime vendor must be within 100 miles of one of the VISN facilities listed in the presolicitation.  There will be a question and answer modification to follow on FBO with an answer to this question for all to see. 8.	So that we can identify the distance of our office locations relative to your facilities, are VISN maps in vector file format (i.e., Illustrator, either AI or EPS file) available that show the location of your facilities?This link will provide a map and links to each VISN for the specific locations: http://www1.va.gov/caresdecision/page.cfm?pg=31.9.	My question is whether the VA prefers that these proposals be led by an Architect or whether we as engineers can prime? The NAICS code listed in FBO was 541310 which is for Architectural Services, but an Engineering Firm under NAICS Code 541330 can also submit as the prime firm, as long as there is an architect on the team and the criteria listed in the presolicitation is followed.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	The solicitation states:"If acceptable SF-330 packages are received from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) firms, the government reserves the right to set aside this procurement for SDVOSB or VOSB, or conduct discussions with the highest qualified SDVOSB or VOSB firms."Based on this, would it be acceptable to submit our SF330 as the Prime A/E (we are not a SDVOSB or VOSB) and also submit as a consultant with a SDVOSB?Yes it is acceptable for your firm to submit as the prime for one SF330, and then to submit as a sub for another firm.2.	Does the A/E firm need to be registered in all states in VISN 6, or in only one state within 100 miles of at least one of the facilities in VISN 6?The AE firm only needs to be registered in at least one of the states, and then can stamp documents for Federal Facilities in the other states listed for VISN 6.3.	Do the A/E firm members of listed disciplines (Architectural - Mechanical - Electrical - Structural - Civil - Landscape - Geotechnical - Surveying / Mapping - Interior Design - Hazardous Materials / Environmental Services (asbestos, lead survey) - National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) - Historic Preservation - Energy - Cost Estimation) need to be registered in all states in VISN 6 (VA, WV, NC)?The subcontractors also need to be licensed in at least one of the states, and then they will be good for Federal Facilities.  Also remember that the subs are under your responsibility, and the Government deals directly with the prime, not the subs.4.	Is this IDIQ exclusively focused on energy projects and thus an engineering solicitation, or are there architectural projects anticipated within the IDIQ as well?As you noted the scope of the work is for energy related projects, but we left it broad as to what disciplines are needed.  There are a number of engineering disciplines needed, but the need for an architect is also there.  This is open for both Architectural and Engineering firms to be the prime.5.	However, it has been brought to my attention that this is an Engineering lead project. Can you please clarify this for us?  This presolicitation is under the 541310 NAICS code, but it is for AE services, which also fall under the 541330 NAICS Code.  An engineering firm is more than able to be the prime, just as long as they have an architect on their team, and follow the criteria listed in the presolicitation.6.	We are reviewing the presolicitation are wondering if the Response Date was still February 15, 2010, as it is a Federal Holiday.The date has been changed to February 16, 2010, and the last day for Technical Questions has been changed to February 9.  These changes were posted on FBO on January 27, 2010.7.	Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.  We just wanted to see more than the traditional ten projects that are listed in section F.  8.	So that we can identify the distance of our office locations relative to your facilities, are VISN maps in vector file format (i.e., Illustrator, either AI or EPS file) available that show the location of your facilities?This link will provide a map and links to each VISN for the specific locations: http://www1.va.gov/caresdecision/page.cfm?pg=31.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	We would like to know how long this project will be going on?  Also when would it start in the Atlanta area?All we are asking for in this presolicitation are Standard Form 330's for Architectural and Engineering firms' qualifications.  There is no solicitation to bid on.  We just want the qualifications so we can review and follow the FAR part 36.6 Architect and Engineering requirements.2.	In general, what percentage of the work will actually be for AE Services and what percentage will be for energy/engineering/other?The question that you have asked is very difficult for us to project, as this will be on a project by project basis.  Our presolicitation lists a number of different possible projects, but there is not a rough number to throw out as to the percentage of Architectural services versus the number of Engineering Services.  This is part of the reason we asked for diverse teams.3.	Will our partner's SDVOSB status help meet potential set-asides should you elect to set-aside this work to SDVOSB firms?The SDVOSB status will not help as a sub.4.	Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.

Additionally, do all of the consultants need to be within 100miles of the same hospital?  The prime firm needs to have either their main office or a branch office within 100 miles of one of the medical facilities listed on the presolicitation.  The consultants do not have to be within 100 miles of the same hospital.  6.	Separate announcements were issued for over 20 individual VISNs.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	Is this a set aside for SDVOB? This presolicitation is encouraging all types of firms to submit their SF330 qualifications for this contract, including both 8(a) and SDVOSB.  As stated in the presolicitation, if acceptable SF330 packages are received from SDVOSB and VOSB firms, the government reserves the right to set-aside this contract for SDVOSB or VOSB firms, if there are enough qualified firms that submit. 2.	Can 8(a) firm be qualified to apply as a prime vendor?Yes, this is open for any size firm.3.	How many firm(s) would you be selecting for this contract?As stated in the presolicitation, one firm will be selected, but the government has the option to make multiple awards.4.	When is the deadline for submitting questions regarding this solicitation?The deadline listed for submitting questions is February 9, 2010.5.	Is there a limit on length of time for this contract?The contract is for a base year, and four 1 year option periods.6.	Is there a limit on fees over the length of this contract?The limit of the contract is $7.5 Million.7.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	Therefore, as a mechanical and electrical consultant, are we required to list with an Architectural Firm as a sub-consultant on this project, in lieu of going after it as Prime Consultant?Yes, somewhere on your team you need to have an Architectural firm. 2.	My question is if our firm takes the lead and the government reserves the right to set aside this procurement will we be out or at that time can we switch our submittal so the SDVOSB is the lead?Your questions sounds like you are only going to submit an SF 330 with your firm as the prime.  You are correct that if the government reserves the right for set-asides, your firm would be out if you only had the SDVOSB firm as a sub.  If you were teamed up with the SDVOSB, and they were the lead on a separate SF330, your firm would still be considered as you would be a sub for the SDVOSB firm. 3.	It sounds like we could submit two SF 330's one with us as the lead and one with the SDVOSB as the lead. Is this correct?Correct.  There is not a limit on how many sub contracting opportunities a firm can be a part of.4.	Will our partner's SDVOSB status help meet potential set-asides should you elect to set-aside this work to SDVOSB firms?The SDVOSB status will not help as a sub.5.	Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.  We just wanted to see more than the traditional ten projects that are listed in section F.  6.	Do all the consultants on a team need to be within 100 miles of a VISN listed hospital?  Additionally, do all of the consultants need to be within 100miles of the same hospital?  The prime firm needs to have either their main office or a branch office within 100 miles of one of the medical facilities listed on the presolicitation.  The consultants do not have to be within 100 miles of the same hospital.  7.	Separate announcements were issued for over 20 individual VISNs.  If our firm wants to submit SF330 information for more than one VISN, can one SF330 be submitted with an indication of the VISNs we are proposing to support, or will a separate SF330 be required for each VISN?Since there are 21 VISN's and 21 presolicitations I would have to say I will take one SF330 for each individual VISN.  If you are interested in three VISN's then I would want to see three separate SF330's.  I am not trying to cause more work, but I am doing this from a logistical and tracking sense so I will be able to distribute everything accordingly.8.	So that we can identify the distance of our office locations relative to your facilities, are VISN maps in vector file format (i.e., Illustrator, either AI or EPS file) available that show the location of your facilities?This link will provide a map and links to each VISN for the specific locations: http://www1.va.gov/caresdecision/page.cfm?pg=31.9.	Can you please tell me if the above referenced RFQ is a small business set aside?The presolicitation that you referenced is not a small business set-aside.  However, if there are enough qualified Service Disabled or Veteran Owned firms that submit their SF330's then the Government reserves the right to make this an SDVOSB or VOSB set-aside.  10.	We are reviewing the presolicitation are wondering if the Response Date was still February 15, 2010, as it is a Federal Holiday.The date has been changed to February 16, 2010, and the last day for Technical Questions has been changed to February 9.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	One of the consultants we are considering to include in our team (for cost evaluation, Critical Path Management and fast track construction planning) is a construction company who may also want to bid on the construction work when it becomes available.  Would inclusion on our team preclude them from providing proposals for construction improvements? Having a construction company on your team is your choice, but a design firm cannot bid on a follow-on construction project.  This is inclusive of the subs that were part of the design team.2.	Our firm is interested in submitting our qualifications for the VISN 10 AE ID/IQ project.  Can an engineering firm submit on the project as the lead consultant?An engineering firm can submit as the lead consultant as long as the team they put together covers the criteria listed in the presolicitation, and there is an architect on the team.3.	Can you please tell me if the above referenced RFQ is a small business set aside?The presolicitation that you referenced is not a small business set-aside.  However, if there are enough qualified Service Disabled or Veteran Owned firms that submit their SF330's then the Government reserves the right to make this an SDVOSB or VOSB set-aside.  4.	We are reviewing the presolicitation are wondering if the Response Date was still February 15, 2010, as it is a Federal Holiday.The date has been changed to February 16, 2010, and the last day for Technical Questions has been changed to February 9.

Will our partner's SDVOSB status help meet potential set-asides should you elect to set-aside this work to SDVOSB firms?The SDVOSB status will not help as a sub.6.	Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.  We just wanted to see more than the traditional ten projects that are listed in section F.  7.	Do all the consultants on a team need to be within 100 miles of a VISN listed hospital?  Additionally, do all of the consultants need to be within 100miles of the same hospital?  The prime firm needs to have either their main office or a branch office within 100 miles of one of the medical facilities listed on the presolicitation.

If our firm wants to submit SF330 information for more than one VISN, can one SF330 be submitted with an indication of the VISNs we are proposing to support, or will a separate SF330 be required for each VISN?Since there are 21 VISN's and 21 presolicitations I would have to say I will take one SF330 for each individual VISN.  If you are interested in three VISN's then I would want to see three separate SF330's.  I am not trying to cause more work, but I am doing this from a logistical and tracking sense so I will be able to distribute everything accordingly.9.	So that we can identify the distance of our office locations relative to your facilities, are VISN maps in vector file format (i.e., Illustrator, either AI or EPS file) available that show the location of your facilities?This link will provide a map and links to each VISN for the specific locations: http://www1.va.gov/caresdecision/page.cfm?pg=31.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	We regularly team with engineering firms and are asking if the Department of Veteran Affairs prefers that we assemble our own team to submit with, or if we submit alone, would the Department team us with other qualified engineers?It is in your best interest for your firm to assemble your own team to meet the criteria in the presolicitation.  The VA does not assigned qualified engineers to team up with other people.  We are in the process of evaluation the SF 330's and the teams listed on the SF330's.  2.	Will there be a solicitation available soon?  Or are you just looking for general information from interested vendors?The NEBC issued the presolicitation asking for firms that were interested in this AE IDIQ contract, to submit their Standard Form 330 Statement of Qualifications.  We will review the SF330's and then follow FAR 36.6 Architect and Engineering, and Brooks Act Procedures, in order to determine what firm will be issued the solicitation.  There will not be a solicitation issued on FBO.3.	We are reviewing the presolicitation are wondering if the Response Date was still February 15, 2010, as it is a Federal Holiday.The date has been changed to February 16, 2010, and the last day for Technical Questions has been changed to February 9.  These changes were posted on FBO on January 27, 2010.4.	Will our partner's SDVOSB status help meet potential set-asides should you elect to set-aside this work to SDVOSB firms?The SDVOSB status will not help as a sub.5.	Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.  We just wanted to see more than the traditional ten projects that are listed in section F.  6.	Do all the consultants on a team need to be within 100 miles of a VISN listed hospital?  Additionally, do all of the consultants need to be within 100miles of the same hospital?  The prime firm needs to have either their main office or a branch office within 100 miles of one of the medical facilities listed on the presolicitation.  The consultants do not have to be within 100 miles of the same hospital.  7.	Separate announcements were issued for over 20 individual VISNs.  If our firm wants to submit SF330 information for more than one VISN, can one SF330 be submitted with an indication of the VISNs we are proposing to support, or will a separate SF330 be required for each VISN?Since there are 21 VISN's and 21 presolicitations I would have to say I will take one SF330 for each individual VISN.  If you are interested in three VISN's then I would want to see three separate SF330's.  I am not trying to cause more work, but I am doing this from a logistical and tracking sense so I will be able to distribute everything accordingly.8.

My question is whether the VA prefers that these proposals be led by an Architect or whether we as engineers can prime? The NAICS code listed in FBO was 541310 which is for Architectural Services, but an Engineering Firm under NAICS Code 541330 can also submit as the prime firm, as long as there is an architect on the team and the criteria listed in the presolicitation is followed.

<DESC>This is a list of questions that have been submitted for this presolicitation, along with answers for each.  Continue to use the modified presolicitation posted on 1/27/2010 for the requirements.1.	It is unclear to me from this announcement whether this project is restricted to Small Businesses, i.e., "and the Small Business Standard is $4.5 million gross annual revenues."  This tells me what the size standard is, but it does not tell me if it is Restricted on Unrestricted.This announcement is unrestricted, with the Government reserving the right to set-aside or only discuss with SDVOSB or VOSB firms if there are enough qualified firms that submit.  This is stated in the presolicitation notice:  "If acceptable SF-330 packages are received from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) firms, the government reserves the right to set aside this procurement for SDVOSB or VOSB, or conduct discussions with the highest qualified SDVOSB or VOSB firms."The language about the Small Business Standard is on this for this reason, but there is nothing that prevents this from being unrestricted.2.	Does the A/E firm need to be registered in all states in VISN 12, or in only one state within 100 miles of at least one of the facilities in VISN 12?The AE firm only needs to be registered in at least one of the states, and then can stamp documents for Federal Facilities in the other states listed for VISN 12.3.	Do the A/E firm members of listed disciplines (Architectural - Mechanical - Electrical - Structural - Civil - Landscape - Geotechnical - Surveying / Mapping - Interior Design - Hazardous Materials / Environmental Services (asbestos, lead survey) - National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) - Historic Preservation - Energy - Cost Estimation) need to be registered in all states in VISN 12 (IL, MI, WI, IN)?The subcontractors also need to be licensed in at least one of the states, and then they will be good for Federal Facilities.  Also remember that the subs are under your responsibility, and the Government deals directly with the prime, not the subs.4.	When reading through this solicitation, we thought it would be appropriate to ask you if the preference was to have a team lead by an Engineer, with an architecture firm as a consultant, or the team lead by the architect?  Based on this information, we thought it seemed that the team might be better fit if lead by an engineer:  A/E services may include planning and designing for VA energy projects to include, but not limited to, geothermal, co-generation, bio-mass, solar photovoltaic, wind turbine, utility metering, retro-commissioning, LEED-EB, renewable energy, feasibility studies, energy efficiency, water conservation and greening of the government projects.The NAICS Code that was listed was 541310 Architectural services, but as you noted there are a number of services that require engineering in this presolicitation.  An engineering firm can be the prime for this.  Just make sure the criteria listed in the presolicitation is covered, and an architect is part of the team.5.	We are reviewing the presolicitation are wondering if the Response Date was still February 15, 2010, as it is a Federal Holiday.The date has been changed to February 16, 2010, and the last day for Technical Questions has been changed to February 9.  These changes were posted on FBO on January 27, 2010.6.	Will our partner's SDVOSB status help meet potential set-asides should you elect to set-aside this work to SDVOSB firms?The SDVOSB status will not help as a sub.7.	Do you want the following 3 criteria ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS, SUSTAINABLE DESIGN, MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES to match with projects listed on individual's resumes instead of the Section F projects we profile?   If so, can it be a representative sampling of the projects on the resumes?  Yes, a representative sampling from those resumes would be appropriate.  We just wanted to see more than the traditional ten projects that are listed in section F.  8.	Do all the consultants on a team need to be within 100 miles of a VISN listed hospital?  Additionally, do all of the consultants need to be within 100miles of the same hospital?  The prime firm needs to have either their main office or a branch office within 100 miles of one of the medical facilities listed on the presolicitation.  The consultants do not have to be within 100 miles of the same hospital.  9.	Separate announcements were issued for over 20 individual VISNs.  If our firm wants to submit SF330 information for more than one VISN, can one SF330 be submitted with an indication of the VISNs we are proposing to support, or will a separate SF330 be required for each VISN?Since there are 21 VISN's and 21 presolicitations I would have to say I will take one SF330 for each individual VISN.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT SUPPORT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT (DOE-EM).
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, IT IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
The Department of Energy awarded a Time and Materials Recovery Act task assignment extension under an existing competitively award General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedule Task Order to Performance Results Corporation (PRC), supporting the Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management (DOE-EM).  The DUNS Number for PRC is 150063936.  This extension permits PRC to complete Headquarters implementation and analysis, and logistics support associated with Recovery Act activities.  A Time and Materials contract type was selected because the use of a Fixed Price contract would have added substantial contingency costs that may have been restrictive, unnecessary, and inflated.  The total value of the extension is $301,640 and the Period of Performance is extended through March 31, 2010.

TREE THINNING SERVICE RECOVERY PROJECT, ON 1,378 ACRES,  LOCATED ON NEWPORT AND SULLIVAN LAKE RANGER DISTRICTS,  COLVILLE NATIONAL FOREST, WASHINGTON STATE 

The objective of this contract is to secure a complete set of services to accomplish stand treatments to increase forest health and vigor, and/or reduce fuels in the wildland/rural interface.  The objectives will be achieved by thinning small trees or whip felling and related work on the Newport and Sullivan Lake Ranger Districts, Colville National Forest.  The thinning will be accomplished by cutting less desirable trees and retaining those that exhibit good growth characteristics such as vigorous growth, no signs of disease, and good position in the canopy or by cutting competing brush from around conifers.  The whip felling will be accomplished by cutting all designated species or size classes designated in the detailed information sheets.  The technical specifications contained in the performance standards were developed based on site-specific stand conditions.

<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED ACTION</span></strong></p>
<p>The NHDP proposes to award a labor-hour contract to the Gillis W. Long Patient Employment Corporation (GWLPEC) to provide therapeutic, vocational, rehabilitative, and diversionary employment for the long-term resident patients at the center.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a follow-on contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only those persons designated as long-term patients of the NHDP are eligible for employment under the contract.<strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong>The contract period is one year, with two one-year options for a total of three years.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -22.5pt"><strong><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background Information</span>:</strong></p>
<p>The NHDP, with statutory responsibility for treatment of persons with Hansen's Disease, has a long standing program providing therapeutic, vocational, rehabilitative, and diversionary employment for the patients residing at the center.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Originally, the patients performing the services were part-time government employees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>A decision was made that the services should be handled under contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1986 the patients formed the Gillis W. Long Patient Employment Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation whose stated purpose is "the operation of a patient oriented rehabilitation work program providing work evaluation, vocational counseling, testing, employment information and training information."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The original contract was awarded to the GWLPEC in 1987.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current contract, HHSH248200860007C was conducted under 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></em></strong>Previous contracts were advertised in the Commerce Business Daily and conducted using competitive acquisition procedures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since 1987, only one other firm submitted a proposal in response to the government requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This proposal continued the resident-patient employment, and proposed to hire a local manager and added corporate overhead and profit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The role of the manager was to interface with the government - a responsibility which has historically been handled by a resident-patient of the GWLPEC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proposed manager and the corporate overhead and profit only served to increase the proposed price of the contract.</p>
<p>The GWLPEC is comprised entirely of those patients working under the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They have no overhead or profit and are capable of managing their own resources to provide the services under this contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Because they are a not-for-profit corporation, they fall under statutory exemption from certain tax requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (statute U.S.C. 3309(b)(4)) states that it shall not apply to services performed "in a facility conducted for the purpose of carrying out a program of (A) rehabilitation for individuals whose earning capacity is impaired by age or physical or mental deficiency or injury, or (B) providing remunerative work for individuals who because of their impaired physical or mental capacity cannot be readily absorbed in the competitive labor market..."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of their not-for-profit status, their self-management and this exemption, the GWLPEC provides labor under the contract at rates which do not include overhead, profit or taxes for which they are exempt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET AGENCY NEEDS AND ESTIMATED VALUE</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The services under the proposed contract will be performed by approximately 13 residents currently receiving long-term care at the NHDP. The work to be provided under this contract consists of furnishing labor necessary for the performance of services in various areas of operation at the National Hansen's Disease Programs, both at Carville and in the two buildings that make up the Baton Rouge Campus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The work is assigned considering the physical and mental health disabilities of the patients as well as the advanced ages of the whole group, ranging from 63 to 101 years of age and will provide therapeutic, vocational, rehabilitative, and diversionary employment for this group of patients.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Flexibility is shown in working hours so that the patients may attend medical appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;The initial period of performance will be one year with two one-year options.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The total contract performance period is three years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The total estimated value of the contract is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">$156,968</span>, including options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>STATUTORY AUTHORITY</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DEMONSTRATION OF UNIQUENESS</span></strong></p>
<p>The GWLPEC has the unique capability to perform the services required under this contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1986, the resident patients formed a non-profit corporation whose stated purpose is "the operation of a "patient oriented rehabilitation work program providing work evaluation, vocational counseling, testing, employment information and training information."</p>
<p>&nbsp;The work assignments are made considering the physical and mental health disabilities of the patients as well as the advanced ages of the whole group, ranging from 63 to 101 years of age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Flexibility is shown in working hours so that the patients may attend medical appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;The GWLPEC is comprised of the entire population the contract is intended to benefit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No other entities can <strong>directly</strong> provide the services to these patients.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any other entity brought in to this arrangement would only add layers of management and administration to the process, and as such additional cost to the program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Additionally, it would be extremely difficult for this group to deal with new leadership at this point in their lives.</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span>The GWLPEC is the only source capable of providing the required services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>EFFORTS WHICH ENSURE OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM PRACTICAL NUMBER OF SOURCES</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;A notice will be publicized at the Government Point of Entry (GPE) as required by FAR 5.2 of the intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with GWLPEC to perform the required services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">&nbsp;</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>CONTRACTING OFFICER'S DETERMINATION CONCERNING COST</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The estimated cost of the contract is $156,968, including options.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Contracting Officer will determine price reasonableness of the contract based on price and/or cost analysis as required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Contracting Officer will determine that all costs are fair and reasonable prior to award.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">8.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>MARKET SURVEY</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Beginning in 1987, this requirement has been synopsized and competitive procedures have been used to conduct the acquisition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since 1987, only one other firm has provided a proposal in response to the solicitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only contribution provided by this offeror was to add a local manager and corporate overhead and profit - which only served to increase the proposed price of the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">9.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>OTHER SOURCES</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;With the stated purpose of the contract to provide therapeutic, vocational, rehabilitative, and diversionary employment for long-term patients of the National Hansen's Disease Programs, it is not reasonable to contract with anyone other than the patients themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contracting with or through another entity would dilute the benefit to the very parties the contract is designed and intended to benefit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ACTIONS TAKEN TO PROMOTE COMPETITION</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Beginning in 1987, this requirement has been synopsized and competitive procedures have been used to conduct the acquisition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since 1987, only one other firm has provided a proposal in response to the solicitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only contribution provided by this offeror was to add a local manager and corporate overhead and profit - which only served to increase the proposed price of the contract.</p>

Length of service<BR>includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<BR>successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<BR>performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)<BR><BR>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<BR>King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<BR>Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A<BR>contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<BR>accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR><BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:<BR><BR>1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<BR>not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<BR>administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because<BR>most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<BR>not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<BR>week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<BR>400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<BR>within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not<BR>list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<BR>data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<BR>$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For<BR>example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<BR>within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<BR>occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<BR>then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<BR>conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<BR>determination.<BR><BR>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<BR>industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<BR>professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<BR>who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<BR>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<BR>consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<BR>specifications;<BR>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<BR>modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<BR>related to user or system design specifications;<BR>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<BR>programs related to machine operating systems; or<BR>    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<BR>requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<BR><BR>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you<BR>work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<BR>and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<BR> If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<BR>regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<BR>premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<BR>(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<BR>overtime work).<BR><BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<BR>employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<BR>in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This<BR>includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<BR>ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<BR>and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<BR>  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<BR>on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations<BR>involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.<BR><BR>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<BR>represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<BR>ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<BR>which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<BR>employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<BR>like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<BR>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<BR>incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials<BR>are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<BR>ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR> UNIFORM ALLOWANCE <BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<BR>(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<BR>local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<BR>laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<BR>employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<BR>determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR>following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<BR>adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<BR>cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<BR>the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<BR>this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<BR>agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<BR>affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<BR>and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in<BR>those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear<BR>materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<BR>not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR>laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<BR>of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<BR>there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<BR><BR>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<BR>Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006,<BR>unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<BR>links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<BR>gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<BR>http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<BR>1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<BR>not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<BR>be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<BR>determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<BR>relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<BR>classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such<BR>conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<BR>fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by<BR>the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<BR>of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<BR>be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<BR>When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<BR>should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<BR>conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<BR>occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<BR>proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<BR>proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<BR>rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<BR>authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<BR>representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the<BR>contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<BR>performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<BR>of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<BR>information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<BR>and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<BR>for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<BR>disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<BR>notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<BR>the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.<BR><BR>When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of<BR>Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<BR>that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<BR>wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<BR>determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<BR>Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<BR>classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>Moncrief Army Community Hospital, Fort Jackson, SC has a requirement for one (01) Dental Stability Meter (Osstell) along with assorted sized Smart Pegs and Peg Mounts.  The Government intends to award a sole source purchase order for this requirement per FAR 6.302-1.  The suggested contractor is Biolin Scientific, Inc.,  a large business.

This is a one time buy, utilizing a Government Purchase Card.  Attempts to find an alternate source for this requirement revealed that Ostell USA is the sole subsidiary in the U.S. authorized to distribute this requirement which is manufactured in Sweden.  Ostell USA is owned by Biolin Scientific, Inc.  This requirement is not available on any Federal Supply Schedule.

This is not a request for proposal.  However, companies that can provide an equal product must submit their technical capabilities to include complete and detailed technical specifications of their product, past performance information, price, and delivery time.  This information will be reviewed by the Government technical representatives for consideration for future requirements.
