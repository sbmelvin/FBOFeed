<DESC>AFRL Space Experiments &amp; Programs Branch (RVEP) is pleased to announce that it intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for its next major space flight experiment in the next 3-6 months. An intensive review of many candidate technologies has been conducted, and two concepts were chosen for our BAA; one or both concepts will be selected for execution. The two concepts are Advanced Missile Warning Sensors Experiment (AMWSE) and the Advanced eXperiment In Orbital Manipulation (AXIOM).<br /><br />AMWSE will determine and characterize the utility of hypertemporal imaging from space. This technology promises great potential for multiple military needs.<br /><br />AXIOM is an experiment designed to demonstrate new uses for advanced solar array technologies combined with advanced Hall Effect thrusters. The AXIOM baseline is for a single high-power, lightweight solar array wing and a single Hall thruster implemented on a small spacecraft bus, though an implementation with two wings and two thrusters may be considered. Extensive orbital maneuvering will be accomplished at altitudes that may range from low Earth orbit through Geostationary orbit. <br /><br />RVEP plans to host a Briefing for Industry (BFI) prior to release of the BAA. The objectives of the briefing will be to acquaint industry with information regarding how AFRL conducts flight experiments, provide additional technical information on the two experiments being considered, and receive industry input. This BFI will be beneficial in determining the basis for the acquisition strategy, which has not been finalized. <br /><br />Further details regarding this upcoming&nbsp;BFI will be posted in the near future as an update to this notice. The FedBizOpps website has a feature on this page where you can register to receive email notifications of any updates. If you choose not to register for these automatic e-mail update notices you can continue to check this website for further updates.

The Government will not reimburse interested sources or responders to this notice (or to documents posted under this announcement) for any costs incurred in responding, or for subsequent exchanges of information. Information submitted does not constitute a proposal, but will be considered an exchange of capabilities and ideas.<br /></span>

<DESC>THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICITATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THE RFI.     THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES TO THIS RFI.  SEIWG 005C, "Interface Specification (RF Data Transmission Interfaces) For DoD Base and Installation Physical Security Systems", was published by the Security Equipment Integration Working Group (SEIWG) on 20 October 2008.  This document is based on SEIWG 005A which was published in October 1985 and updated with a two-page addendum, SEIWG 005B, in January 2006.   The SEIWG has completed a draft version of SEIWG 005D and is soliciting any comments but with an emphasis on the following:  Does the new stand! ard support typical physical security RF devices?  Does it allow end users to capitalize on those capabilities while increasing interoperability and maintaining backwards compatibility?   Does 005D adequately reflect current sensor technology?  Do any backwards compatibility issues exist with draft 005D?  Does 005D provide adequate direction?   This information will help the SEIWG determine if the current draft of SEIWG 005D is ready and suitable for formal release or, if not, comments will help us identify areas for improvement.   All responses to the RFI are requested by 11 March 2011.  If possible, please enter comments into the Comment Resolution Matrix (CRM) that is provided under the "Available Documents" section of this RFI.

The proposed acquisition is direct to the University of Puerto Rico, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Any source other than the University of Puerto Rico would require substantial duplication of time and cost to the Government, neither of which would be recovered through the additional competition, and unacceptable delay would also be incurred in fulfilling the Government's requirement.  A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract will be used.  The period of performance will consist of 8 months from date of award.<BR><BR>The Contractor shall develop a web-based Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) module that is assessable through the Aviation System Assessment Program (ASAP) Database that is capable of importing FMECAs for each aviation platform and storing those CMECAs in a standard format.  The FMECA module shall be capable of exporting FMECAs and relating those FMECAs to the correct Work Unit Code (component) within the ASAP Database.  The FMECA module shall also display specific FMECA information (Failure Rates, Severity Class, etc.) for a specific Work Unit Code when requested.  The Contractor shall develop the functionality to track modifications to existing FMECAs.  The Contractor shall also investigate the process needed to use information from the ASAP Database to create new FMECAs.  The Contractor shall provide a report outlining the Website design, screen layouts, and FMECA to ASAP output requirements.  The Contractor shall provide a report outlining the Query definitions within the FMECA module to the results of testing the Query definitions using available data.  The Contractor shall provide a report showing the results of the software functionality development and testing.   The Contractor shall provide software drops as required by the Government to the ASAP Database developer so the software can be incrementally reviewed before it is installed on an U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center AMRDEC server.

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals to manage the life-threatening blood infection known as sepsis. The goal of the Dialysis Like Therapeutics (DLT) program is to<br />develop a portable device capable of controlling relevant components in the entire blood volume on clinically relevant time scales. Reaching this goal is expected to require significant advances in sensing, complex fluid manipulation, separation of components from these fluids, and mathematical descriptions capable of providing predictive control over the closed-loop process. The envisioned device would save the lives of thousands of military patients each year by effectively treating sepsis and associated complications.

<CONTACT>Beth Snyder, Phone (541) 750-7113, Fax (541) 750-7236, Email besnyder@fs.fed.us
<DESC>The US Forest Service, Siuslaw National Forest, intends to issue a sole source contract for law enforcement dispatch services with Lincoln County Communications Agency in Newport, Oregon. The Willamette and Siuslaw National Forests include lands within nine counties of Western Oregon. We have lands in: Tillamook, Yamhill, Lincoln, Benton, Lane, Douglas, Coos, Linn, and Marion counties. The standard within the state of Oregon for Forest Service Law Enforcement is to contract dispatch services through county police dispatch centers. However, because we currently have invested in infrastructure and mountain top repeaters we are able to utilize Forest Service Law Enforcement frequencies rather than county police frequencies to dispatch officers within all nine counties, from one dispatch center. In addition to the benefits of consolidating dispatch contracts from nine to one, having one dispatch center provides for superior officer safety. With a sole dispatcher center, zone officers can monitor each other on a common frequency, and can respond quicker in emergent situations, thus eliminating the time it would take to relay information through multiple dispatch centers. The selected dispatch center must have police dispatching capability, including access to:<br />National Crime Data Base, (NCIC), State of Oregon Criminal Data Base, (LEDS), and access to<br />DMV records, including registered owners of vehicles and drivers license information. The<br />dispatch center must have the capability to access secure warrant information within multiple<br />Judicial districts. To accomplish the single dispatch center concept, the Forest Service has invested in infrastructure and radio equipment. The equipment is currently set up at a base station in Corvallis Oregon, and T-1 lines, (high speed telephone lines), are installed, providing a link from the base station to the Lincoln County Police Dispatch Center, (Lincom). In order for a dispatcher to quickly, accurately and competently respond to an officer request and/or emergency situations, he/she must have knowledge of the geographic areas within the land<br />base. Each dispatcher requires four to five days of training. This training is conducted through<br />ride-a-long's with Law Enforcement officers within the geographic areas on both Forests. We have a vast amount of money and time invested in infrastructure and dispatcher training at Lincom. Changing dispatch centers would require moving the equipment to a new location. A new base station would need to be established and infrastructure would need to be moved to the new location. An additional investment in dispatcher training would be required, adding an extra expense. T-1 lines would have to be established at the new location. A potential lapse in police dispatch services of four to eight weeks could be expected, in order to provide the time to move equipment, and establish the new T-1 connection. This would create an unnecessary officer safety issue.
<p>This action is taken pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6-302.1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.</p>
<p>The solicitation number assigned to this effort is AG-04T0-S-11-0006 and it will be issued on or about fifteen (15) days after release of this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC>AN/TPY-2 Radar Production and Foreign Military Sales (FMS)
<p>It is the intent of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to issue a sole source solicitation to Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems (Raytheon), 225 Presidential Way, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801-1060 to manufacture and deliver up to two (2) AN/TPY-2 Radars for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirements and provide three years of follow-on operations and sustainment support. The solicitation requirements will include the Engineering and Logistics Support necessary to field the AN/TPY-2 Radars in support of the THAAD Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). In addition to engineering, logistics and technical support, the solicitation requirements will also include: software, software support, training, spares and assorted technical publications. All AN/TPY-2 components to be delivered to the FMS customer will be integrated into an operational THAAD weapon system.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition will be sole source to Raytheon pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) &amp; (iii) as the resulting contract is for highly specialized supplies and services where it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delays of the requirement. Raytheon is the prime sole-source contractor on the current AN/TPY-2 Radar Development and Production Contract HQ0006-03-C-0047 and the Consolidated Contractor Logistic Support Contract HQ0006-08-D-0003 which provides for the operation and sustainment support to AN/TPY-2 radars; in addition, Raytheon has developed and manufactured AN/TPY-2 radars as the primary subcontractor under THAAD Contract, DASG60-00-C-0072. No other company has manufactured the AN/TPY-2 radar or integrated the radar into a weapons system. Only Raytheon is capable of manufacturing critical AN/TPY-2 components and integrating them into the Radars and providing field support without substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities may contact Raytheon, Ms. Marita Spring, Contract Manager 339 645-6240. Point of contact for the Missile Defense Agency is Mr. Ritchie Vinson, MDA/DACX 256 450-1450.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability by responding to this requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all information received within sixty days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Any party interested in this requirement should contact this office within 15 days after publication of this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1 with NEL America, Inc. in Saddle Brook, NJ for the purchase of a poled lithium niobate crystal.
<p>*** The sole source is based on the following:</p>
<p><br />The required crystal is a custom design that can only be made by the proposed contractor. Other companies that supply waveguide PPLN produce the waveguide structure usually via proton exchange which we cannot use in our experiment due to massive absorption in our operting range (2500-4500 nm). NEL uses an etching technique to fabricate the waveguide, preventing additional absorption at mid-infrared wavelengths. They are also capable of making the desired aperiodic (i.e. chirped) grating structure and applying the anti-reflection coatings.</p>

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811213 and the business size standard in $10M.  <br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.
<p>Period of Performance:  Performance shall be for twelve months from date of award.</p>
<p>OSFM provides support to NCI  in space management, space acquisitions, design, renovation and construction of space.   OSFM  is responsible for the administration and successful operation of the space and lease holdings of NCI. The OSFM has responsibility for not only maintaining the facility but also providing conference and meeting spaces utilized by employees to conduct meetings and seminars.  The conference rooms are equipped with audio visual equipment to facilitate the effective dissemination, display and projection of information.  The OSFM has responsibility for approximately 21 conference/meeting rooms that are all equipped with various pieces of audio visual equipment.   <br /> <br />The contractor shall:<br />&bull;	Maintain and repair all audio visual equipment keeping NCI customers apprised of availability of their required equipment <br />&bull;	Provide onsite user support to NCI customers<br />&bull;	Respond to all email, voice and written requests for information <br />&bull;	Provide a mechanism through which audio-visual equipment may be reserved for customer use <br />&bull;	Ensure that all conference rooms where audio visual equipment is installed are functioning properly.  <br />&bull;	Provide delivery (collection) and set up of audio visual equipment as requested/ required by the user/ customer.<br />&bull;	Provide guidance to the user/ customer on the appropriate equipment that can be used to meet their needs and the manner in which to use such equipment</p>
<p>NET-AV has successfully installed and equipped each of the aforementioned conference rooms with the necessary equipment as specified by the NCI.  The various presentation and communication systems that are installed throughout NCI facilities are proprietary to NET AV.   The equipment, wiring and the design of the current system are complex and highly sophisticated.  The current system was designed specifically to meet the needs of the NCI, the design of the system and the equipment utilized is proprietary to NET-AV.  Moreover, the cost of replacing the existing audio visual equipment that is currently installed should an alternate vendor be selected would result in excessive costs that are not in the interest of NCI as we are vacating this facility in early 2013.</p>
<p>In order to preserve the considerable investment that the NCI has made in the audio visual equipment OSFM is contracting for NET-AV to provide maintenance services and technical support.   The proprietary nature of the audio visual equipment and the complexity of the communication and presentation system makes NET-AV uniquely qualified to provide the required support services.  The selection of a vendor other than NET AV to perform the required services could potentially result in damage to the equipment and additional costs.  <br /> <br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on February 22, 2011.  No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Ward, Contract Specialist, at  wardmr@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference solicitation number NCI-110028-MW on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), COAC Services Branch (CSB), on behalf of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Dr. Malini Ahuja, 728 Gatestone Street, Gaithersburg, MD 20878-2182 to provide Research Services in the Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch (MPTB), NIDCR.</p>
<p>The MPTB has a need for the services of an expert who can perform extensive mutagenesis of Ca&sup2;+ influx channels and produce mice that are defective in these channels.  This expertise is necessary in order to expand upon the current studies in patients that are suffering from Sjogren's syndrome.  Primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by exocrine gland dysfunction primarily involving the salivary and lacrimal gland.  The histologic hallmark of SS is a periductal inflammatory infiltrate.  The conventional explanation of salivary gland dysfunction assumes a causal relationship between this chronic inflammatory process and the decreased saliva production.  However, most patients preserved salivary gland tissue, and overall, the correlation between the focus score on salivary gland biopsy (a measure of inflammation) and saliva production is limited.  Recent studies at NIDCR have suggested that aberrant Ca&sup2;+ influx is critical for development of the disease and warrant further testing of the impact of the various Ca&sup2;+ influx channels of salivary glands to the disease state.</p>
<p>In this study, NIDCR plans to understand the function and dysfunction of Ca&sup2;+ influx channels as they relate to Sjogren's syndrome and develop genetic and pharmacological tools to control channel function in vivo as a potential therapeutic approach to the disease.  The specific tasks to be performed are to determine how regulation of the Ca&sup2;+ influx channels by the Ca&sup2;+ sensor STIM1 is altered in the disease and whether channel activity can be modulated safely to halt tissue damage.  Mutagenesis screens and generation of mutant mice will be generated to approach the problem.</p>
<p>The sole source justification is based on the fact that Dr. Malini Ahuja has the background, knowledge, and experience needed for the research of this project.  Dr. Ahuja received her PhD in Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology in 2001 and has four (4) years of experience in the field of molecular biology and physiology of Ca&sup2;+ channels, performing Ca&sup2;+ channel studies in muscle from mutant mice.  Dr. Ahuja has an extensive background in both molecular biology techniques and analysis of Ca&sup2;+ channel function while working as a postdoctoral fellow and visiting scientist at the Johns Hopkins University, University of Maryland, and Duke University.  Her experience and background are required for the needs of this research project.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be from 03/01/11 - 02/28/13.</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), Bethesda, MD.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology, and is a small business set aside. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-49 (January 24, 2011).</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by February 14, 2011 at 12:00pm Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements.</p>
<p>Inquiries to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(DE)-2011-098-JML, may be submitted to the COAC Services Branch, Office of Acquisitions, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6151, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Jonathan Lear.

<DESC><p>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from incumbent BAE Systems Applied Technologies, Inc. (BAE), 1601 Research Boulevard, Rockville, MD 20850 that will provide for support to the Integrated Communications and Information Systems (ICIS) Division (Code 4.5.10) of NAWCAD in the design, integration, testing, installation, training, and certification of shipboard C4I electronic communication systems; the design, integration, testing, installation, training, and certification of like systems at shore sites associated with the deployment of fleet support to surface ships; and the design, integration, testing, installation, training, and certification of mobile and airborne C4I electronic communication systems designed to interface with the C4I electronic architecture of surface ships. This acquisition will result in a stand alone cost plus fixed-fee completion bridge contract with an estimated award date of 24 June 2011. The proposed bridge contract is needed for continuing on-going projects currently being done under exisiting BAE contract N00421-01-C-0077 while the follow-on action, estimated award November 2011, is being competed. Due to the on-going nature of the projects currently being done under Contract N00421-01-C-0077 and the need to continue these services without a break in work, BAE is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a follow-on contract. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, responsible interested parties may submit a proposal in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider all information received by 23 February 2011, 1530 EST. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. For information contact Kym Parker, Code 2.5.1.2.4.5, Telephone (301) 995-4817, FAX (301) 995-0430 or via email: kimberly.l.parker@navy.mil.</p>
<p><br />Per FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." BAE Systems Technology Solutions and Services is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services without causing a break in work through the award of a stand alone cost plus fixed-fee completion bridge contract. BAE Systems Technology Solutions and Services is the sole source capable of providing these efforts without creating the impact on the fielded systems, sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in service. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services for this short period of performance prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government would incur and not recover through competitition, this will be procured on a sole source basis.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:Three-Dimensional Spatial and Temporal Monitoring of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) in New Jersey Coastal Waters Using Automated Underwater Vehicles
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), Region 2, Office Acquisition Management (OAM) Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Rutgers University, Camden, NJ.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710.
The Office of Research and Development (ORD), EPA Region 2, and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) have identified the need to continuously monitor dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations over a broad area for specific problem identification, diagnosis, coastal monitoring, and to generate data needed to meet the water quality assessment goals of the Clean Water Act (CWA).  Obtaining this data for coastal areas as an essential need to support informed decision-making.  From beach-going, tourism, and fishing to the luxury of beach-front living, the ecosystem services provided by the coastal environment are critical to the economy of the State.  A significant threat to the sustainability of these services is reduced oxygen conditions, also known as hypoxia, which makes understanding its causes and extent important.
The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor that possesses the unique capabilities to provide the instrumented, programmable Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) propelled by buoyancy adjustment with two-way communication that allows reprogramming the path while deployed during July, August, and September of 2011 and 2012, with an established data reduction and management system compatible with a NJDEP secure database.  The supplier must have the ability to deploy and recover the AUV from Sandy Hook, NJ to Cape May, NJ during the designated period and have a working knowledge of the undersea characteristics of the coastal area.  These unique capabilities are essential for contract performance because each is integral to EPA?s research and monitoring objectives for the New Jersey near-shore waters, developing transferable standard operating procedures, and supporting the Mid-Atlantic Regional Coastal Ocean Observation System. 
EPA has conducted market research to determine those firms that could conduct this specific research, and Rutgers University was identified as the only known firm that has developed the UAV system and piloted the tool during the summer of 2009.  The experience has led to the supporting the NJDEP database and the Mid-Atlantic Regional Coastal Ocean Observation System.  This also gives the university a unique understanding of the character of the near-shore characteristic and conditions.  EPA believes that other UAVs may exist that can be modified to make these measurements, for example the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.  The low dollar value and the cost of modification and shipment makes it very unlikely that others would bid.Work is to consist of the following:In this project, Rutgers shall obtain and mount an optical oxygen sensor (Optode) on one or more Slocum gliders.  Rutgers shall adapt the existing data management system at COOL to include appropriate fields for DO and prepare for data release.  This modification shall include the recognized goal to releasing the monitoring data to the public though an internet portal and the MARCOOS support.
Rutgers shall provide, prepare, and deploy the gliders off the New Jersey coast to obtain a spatially and temporally intensive 3-dimensional map of water-column conditions.  After consulting with EPA and NJDEP, Rutgers shall program the glider with the course along the coast.   The deployments shall run along the New Jersey coast from Sandy Hook to Cape May and vary from 0.25 to 3.0 nautical miles from the coastline.   Rutgers shall recover the glide at the end of each cruise.  Rutgers shall undertake three deployments between July and September during the summers of 2011 and 2012.  One deployment shall be during mid-August when previous monitoring activities identified low oxygen concentrations in New Jersey coastal waters.   EPA anticipates the each deployment will last about three weeks, allowing one week between cruises for maintenance before the next deployment. 
Rutgers shall propose a route along the coast based on experience gained from a pilot deployment in near shore coastal waters during August and September 2009.  EPA anticipates a zigzag pattern from north to south ranging from 0.25 nm and 3.0 nm from shore.  Rutgers shall, as part of the glider preparation and mission planning, invite NJDEP and EPA personnel to participate in formal planning meetings.  
Rutgers shall provide full support for glider preparation, mission planning, and mission execution including all calibrations before each cruise.  Before the first cruise, Rutgers shall prepare and submit to EPA for approval, a Quality Assurance Plan.  The Quality Assurance plan must include an appended draft standard operating procedures.  The plan must follow the structure and content provided by EPA.  No environmental data may be collected without an approved Quality Assurance Plan.
Rutgers shall program the glider to transmit data to COOL at each surfacing.  Detection of hypoxia shall initiate a series of actions.  Rutgers shall notify partners at NJDEP and EPA that the hypoxic zone has been detected and provide appropriate supporting data.  The team shall jointly determine what actions shall be taken within the overall constraints of the trip.  A possible response would be for the glider to be reprogrammed to more intensively monitor the area where hypoxia was detected.  Decision-making resulting from observed hypoxia will primarily be the responsibility of NJDEP and EPA Region 2, however, expert advice from Rutgers will be critical in the decision-making process.  This will provide specific information on the consistency, longevity, and spatial extent of the hypoxic area.   EPA recognizes that lingering in a given area for and extensive period may shorten the length of that cruise.
Upon the completion of each trip, Rutgers shall prepare graphically displays and submit the results to EPA and NJDEP.  Rutgers shall review the data to assure that it meets the project Quality Assurance requirements, and post the data collected in a given cruise to the NJDEP data base within 30 days of each glider recovery.   Method validation and verification shall be conducted using existing data collected through other Rutgers projects, EPA and NJDEP coastal monitoring efforts, or the collection of additional data.
Deliverables:   Within 2 weeks of award, Rutgers shall prepare and deliver a QA plan to the EPA project office for review.  The QA plan must include a description of changes made to the COOL data management system to include the DO data elements.  
Before each cruise, Rutgers shall coordinate a meeting with EPA and NJDEP to establish the path.  Once established, Rutgers shall program the glider with the path along the coast.  During the July to September window in each summer, Rutgers shall launch the glider near Sandy Hook, NJ and recover the glider at the end of the cruise.
Within 30 days of the recovery of the gliders Rutgers shall submit to EPA the complete data set that has undergone QA review. Rutgers shall post the data to the NJDEP and EPA data bases and update the SOP as necessary based on the lessons learned during the cruise
No later than April 1, 2013, Rutgers shall prepare and submit a report to EPA describing the results of the data collection, the validation/verification of the results, and the final standard operating procedures.
This is not a request for proposal. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications. Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice. 
A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. The applicable NAICS code is 541710. Please submit your request in writing to: US EPA, Samantha Fuchs at 26 W.

<SUBJECT>Generation of monoclonal antibodies to VP4 and a hydrophobic peptide of VP1 of poliovirus
<SOLNBR>RFQ-RT-11-00010
<RESPDATE>022311
<ARCHDATE>02082012

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement to generate specific monoclonal antibodies to the VP4 capsid protein and a hydrophobic peptide of VP1 of poliovirus for use towards understanding the persistence and ecology of enteric viruses in drinking water systems. Currently, the significance of the transient forms of the enterovirus capsid and other factors that might induce alternate capsid conformations is poorly understood. Antibodies directed against these normally internal structures can help identify factors, such as environmental stressors, that induce a conformational change. Additionally, the significance of the transient state of these dynamic structures can be investigated to determine their role in enterovirus persistence in aquatic matrices.
<p>This requirement was originally synopsized on 12//09/2010 to be awarded as a competitive small business set-aside. However, due to the lack of small business competition, the small business set-aside has been dissolved and the RFQ will be amended as full and open competition. Please note that the reference number originally synopsized as RFQ-RT-11-00010 was replaced with RFQ-RT-11-00002 when our legacy contracting system was replaced with our new acquisition system. The base effort will require an estimated (4) months to complete, however, if the option is exercised by the Government the total period of performance will be (8) eight months after award. NAICS Code 541711 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees. Quotes will be due approximately 15 calendar days after issuance of the request for quote (RFQ), IAW. FAR Part 13. The RFQ and any amendments will be available via the Internet http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd. It will be the responsibility of the interested parties to frequently check the same site for any updates or changes regarding this requirement. Quotes are to be submitted to John Southerland, Jr., Contracting Officer, by email at southerland.john@epa.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is not an announcement of a Solicitation.  The U.S. Geological Survey needs to assess industry interest and capability to provide environmental time-series-data software and software support services.In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information for Solicitation and Planning Purposes (October 1997), this notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Department of the Interior (DOI)/U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to assess the responses to inform its decision-making. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to contract for services. The government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this notice and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with RFI submission. Responses to this RFI will not affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any RFP that might follow. Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such and the government will ensure this information is not released externally. The overarching objective for this RFI is information gathering and not acquisition of products or services.Part of the mission of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is to provide hydrologic information that contributes to the wise management of the Nation's natural resources and that promotes the health, safety, and well-being of the people. This information consists of databases and descriptions and analyses of the water resources of the United States. Much of the streamflow, groundwater, and water-quality data collected by the Water Mission Area of the USGS are time-series data measured at a frequency of as much as 12 times per hour. The USGS currently stores and processes its time-series water data in an internally developed and maintained system. Recent evaluations of the efficiencies of our time-series data processes have identified our greatest need to be a modern, powerful set of software tools to increase the efficiency of our time-series data collection, processing, review, and dissemination. The immediacy and scope of this need requires that we look beyond our normal software development process.Consequently, we are performing market research on a data-processing system that supports these needs for our surface-water, groundwater, and water-quality time-series data. For this, we are issuing a general request for information to vendors of time-series water-data processing software. The ideal software system should include the following features and characteristics:
A.	Software System functionality	Allows for full support of any type of time-series data and meta-data (e.g. groundwater, surface water, water quality, atmospheric).	Includes an intuitive graphical user interface 	Not tied to a specific data model/database but adaptable to read other data and meta-data structures.	Allows for different user-level privileges to maintain access to data editing, data approval, and site and database administrative functions.	Provides the ability to ingest historical data from legacy systems	Functions under the most recent versions of Windows (7, XP, 2003, Vista, etc ).	Allow for implementation on a portable PC and its operation in standalone mode in the field.	Used in a network environment where data is replicated over multiple nodes	Allows for integration of external, user written, scripts or modules for data processing or display.B.	Data acquisition	Includes system for time-series data acquisition using GOES satellite, modem, and other telemetry systems. 	Allows for manual uploading of time-series logger files.	Includes ability to manually and automatically process files containing discrete measurements, site inspections, calibrations, and other site visit data.	Supports loading and use of site metadata information such as surveying data, cross-sections, photos, etc.	Includes the capacity to apply automated QA/QC procedures to screen and flag real-time data, to monitor site and sensor conditions, and to issue automated reporting/alerts.C.	Data processing	Includes the ability to display and manage site visit data (discrete measurements, inspections, calibrations, etc.)	Includes a computation module to generate discharge and other parameters both manually and automatically, applying relevant data corrections, ratings, and shifts.	Includes a module to develop other user-selected models for the computation of parameters from one or more time-series data sets and a computation module to apply those models both manually and automatically. 	Includes a module for the graphic creation and maintenance of stage-discharge ratings and rating shifts.	Includes a module for the graphical development of data corrections for sensor fouling, sensor drift or other corrections that integrates time series and site visit data.	Includes a module for graphical and tabular editing of time-series data and daily summary statistics (e.g. daily mean values)	Includes the ability to automatically compute and apply data corrections and rating shifts based on entered site visit data.	Includes methods to develop regression models and to estimate missing time-series data from regression equations or other means.	Includes the ability to automatically apply data grades or uncertainty to time-series data.	Stores an audit trail of data editing, corrections and processing steps.	Includes the ability to store comments related to all processing steps (edits, corrections, rating application, estimates, etc.) and to compile those comments into a site analysis history.	Includes the ability to generate daily, monthly, and annual statistics	Includes the ability to analyze time-series data for peak events and other period of record extremes.D.	Data review	Maintains levels of data processing to track the status of the time-series data review up to data approval.

<DESC>Synopsis of the proposed dredging - Buttermilk Channel, NY, Federal Navigation Project<BR><BR>The New York District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) proposes to perform maintenance dredging in the Buttermilk Channel Federal Navigation Project, with subsequent placement of the dredged material at a suitable contractor-furnished, state-permitted upland placement site(s).  The proposed maintenance dredging would remove approximately 75,000 cubic yards of sediment (approx. 25,000 cubic yards as basic work, and the remaining as options).  Dredging in the basic work area will be required to a depth of 40 feet below Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) with 1 foot allowable over-depth.  Dredging in the option work area will be required to a depth of 35 feet below Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) with 1 foot allowable over-depth.  Due to restrictions found in the water quality certificate, the proposed work must/can only be performed by a large mechanical dredge with a closed environmental clamshell bucket.  Additionally, multiple barges and tug boats will be needed to perform the work during the dredging, dewatering and unloading operations. The apparent low bidder shall, within 35 calendar days from the date the apparent low bidder is notified of being such, provide copies of all required permits and approvals for transfer, transportation, dewatering and/or other processing, and final disposal of dredged material, and shall submit evidence of such permits and approvals to the Government.  Bidders should consult with Section 008000 paragraph 1.3 of the Specifications for all submittal requirements.  The Contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt by him the notice to proceed, to prosecute said work diligently and to complete the basic work ready for use not later than twenty three (23) calendar days after the receipt by him of the notice to proceed.  There are several options to the contract.  The options, if they are exercised, may not be exercised in numerical order.  If the options are exercised, their performance periods will be consecutive. The time for contract completion of each option will be determined by allowing a rate of one calendar day for each 2,250 cubic yards removed. The contractor is required to maintain an integrated production of at least 2,250 cubic yards per calendar day.  The work is estimated to cost between $6,000,000-$8,000,000 (basic and options).  Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about February 22, 2011 with bid opening on/about March 24, 2011.  It is the intention of the Government to award in May 2011 and issue the NTP on/about June 3, 2011.   <BR><BR>Liquidated Damages - $1,870.00 per calendar day of delay until all work under the contract are accepted.<BR><BR>This is an unrestricted procurement.<BR><BR>The applicable NAICS code is 237990 with a size standard of $20 million. Bid opening will be held at 26 Federal Plaza, New York, New York 10278 in room 1841. Small Business Goals: If a large business, the prime contractor shall provide its small business subcontracting plan conforming to the requirements of FAR 19.704 and DFARS 219.7. The small business goals are as follows: Small Business 70%, Small Disadvantaged Business 6.2%, Women-Owned Small Business 7.0%, HubZone Small Business 9.8%, and Veteran-Owned Small Business 3.5%, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 2.0%.  A subcontracting plan reflecting goals less than indicated, shall provide, as part of the subcontracting plan submission, those extenuating circumstances of why the goal cannot be met. You may contact the District, Deputy Small Business advocate or your local SBA for assistance. A contract will not be awarded until the Contracting Officer has determined that the subcontracting plan provides maximum practicable opportunities for Small, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Hubzone Small Business and Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business program concerns to participate in contract performance.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) only. This Sources Sought synopsis does not constitute a formal solicitation, Request for Proposal (RFP), or a promise to issue a formal solicitation or RFP. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to ultimately award a contract. This is for planning and market research purposes only and shall not be considered as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis. No proprietary data should be submitted in response to the synopsis. Any costs associated with responding to this synopsis will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this synopsis does not preclude participation in any future potential solicitation or RFP. Any submissions will be considered to be public information. Responses will not be returned.
<p>The information provided in this synopsis is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.</p>
<p>1) Introduction<br />The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) is seeking to identify qualified sources capable of satisfying some or all of the requirements for a Multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction capability.</p>
<p>2) Capability Goals<br />The chief goals of the multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction capability are:<br />&bull; Provide a means to record multiple classification level multimedia inputs of ongoing operations at various operational nodes throughout the United States and Canada<br />&bull; Provide expedient and effective capture, storage, search, retrieval and analysis of multimedia inputs<br />&bull; Support and enhance event reconstruction processes<br />&bull; As requested, support DoD Forensic Enterprise (DFE) initiatives</p>
<p>3) Key Functions<br />The key functions within the multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction capability include data conversion (as necessary), authoritative timing system, data management and analysis, and data storage.</p>
<p>This capability is needed to ensure the multimedia data surrounding an operational, training, test, or exercise event is captured. This data can be used to re-create, examine, and analyze the event to determine event sequences and actions that took place. The multimedia event reconstruction capabilities can provide valuable analysis tools, leading to significant improvements in operational performance.</p>
<p>Multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction analysis provides the capability to conduct end-to-end reconstruction and visualization of operational, training, exercise, and test events. Potential multimedia inputs include:</p>
<p>Data Audio Video<br />Multiple command and control Common Operational Picture (COP) sources; Chat logs (e.g., Jabber, mIRC), Email activity, SharePoint, Event Logs, Audio/Video Controller logs. Multiple voice sources: Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN), Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), secure telephone, Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) phones, approved cellular phones (e.g. blackberry), Integrated Intercom. Multiple information system sources: Common Operational Picture (COP) displays, Decision Support Systems, and event tracking applications available at operator consoles and knowledge wall screens. <br />Video Teleconference (including desktop systems)</p>
<p>The capability should ideally provide audio, video, and data collection and distribution capabilities. This includes accepting inputs from a variety of audio, video and data devices, performing the necessary media and format conversions, and providing the distribution and delivery means. Data distribution can be via a dedicated or private IP based network or via dedicated switching technologies. In order to analyze and manipulate stored data, all inputs must be referenced to a common timing source. In addition, the file structure and storage mechanisms must support metadata tagging, advanced queries and search functions. Finally, analytic tools to allow integrated reconstruction and visualization of events must be provided.</p>
<p>4) Design Requirements<br />a) Standardized Approach - Since there are many distributed nodes, a standard approach to implementing multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction is needed. For example, deciding to store inputs in digital formats instead of analog provides a much richer set of commercial products to develop and deliver the desired capabilities. Avoid implementing a site specific solution at each node without having established common standards and formats. <br />b) Interoperable - The degree to which data needs to be exchanged and readable between nodes is an important question. Use of proprietary data formats may be acceptable if there is sufficient support for industry standard formats as well. Each may play an important and separate role within the system or at a particular node. For example, proprietary formats allow efficient storage of large numbers of video streams. However, it is highly desirable to export and share data using any web-browser or multi-media player.<br />c) Information Assurance - The operational requirement has been established to operate the multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction capability as a dedicated network at the TS/SCI classification level. This means that adherence to the DOD DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTIVE 6/3 - PROTECTING SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION WITHIN INFORMATION SYSTEMS (also known as DCIDS 6.3) is required. <br />d) Scalability - Since the delivery of multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction capabilities will be phased in over a period of time, the system must be scalable in terms of the number of operational nodes, input feeds, multimedia types and formats, data storage capacity, and processing.<br />e) Time-synchronized - A key capability is that all data feeds must be time stamped to a single time source. The granularity of how often data is stamped and the size of the data to be stamped is a design detail, but time stamping is essential to allow automated reconstruction and facilitate search and query capabilities.</p>
<p>5) Requested Information:<br />Prospective sources, possessing the qualifications, capability, and experience to respond to this RFI, in part or in whole, are invited to submit documentation in response to items listed under section 1 thru 4 above and outlining the following items:</p>
<p>a) Company information, which includes point of contact, address, type of company, size and level of facility clearance;</p>
<p>b) Description of experience in the field of multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction;</p>
<p>c) Description of potential technical approaches, and solutions that will satisfy the goals, objectives, and design requirements of a multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction capability;</p>
<p>d) Description of any teaming considerations/arrangements/strategies to address support of RFI requirements;</p>
<p>6) Submission Instructions:</p>
<p>a) Interested parties are requested to respond to this synopsis inclusive of answers to the requested information listed above.</p>
<p>c) Responses shall be in Microsoft Word compatible format and are due on or before 3:00 PM (local Eastern Time), Tuesday February 22, 2011.</p>
<p>d) Responses to this RFI may be evaluated by Non-Government technical experts. All non-government support personnel have signed and bound by the appropriate non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The Government may also use these selected support contractor personnel as technical advisors in the evaluation of responses.</p>
<p>e) No proprietary information should be provided in the response. Be advised that no submissions will be returned. All submissions will be disposed of in accordance with NORAD and USNORTHCOM organizational discretion.</p>

<DESC>IRM/OPS/CSO (CSO) has a requirement to provide its FTE program management staff, including its division chiefs, branch chiefs, and team leads, with training to better understand today's work environment where performance-based IT service contracts are in use. Under the Department's IT Desktop Support Consolidation program, CSO has become responsible for one of the Department's largest performance-based services contracts that currently has a contractor staff of over 230 individuals. CSO FTE staff has been struggling to understand the new dynamic that places them in a Government oversight role and makes them responsible for the accomplishment of work but leaves them without the capability to individually direct all the work for which they retain responsibility. CSO requires a one-day, instructor led, on-site training course for a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 20 students that presents and discusses the issues, responsibilities, and risks of managing and operating in this type of mixed Government FTE and contractor workplace.

<p>Questions for Industry:</p>
<p>Please prepare a capabilities statement to address the foregoing and at a minimum the items enumerated below:</p>
<p>(1) Is the shipyard's dry-dock currently NAVSEA certified? If not, what certification does it currently hold? Has it ever been NAVSEA certified in the past?</p>
<p>(2) This availability is currently anticipated to have a period of performance of approximately 270 beginning on/about 12 January 2012. The dry-docking will be restricted to the first 60 days of the availability. Is your dry-dock available in this timeframe? Do you have the capacity to manage this size availability given other workload anticipated for this same timeframe?</p>
<p>(3) The machinery control system will be replaced during this availability by a Government Contractor. The shipyard will be responsible for removing the existing control consoles and supporting GFE installation. The time frame to accomplish this removal is within the first 60 days of the overhaul. What if any experience does the shipyard have with this type of work with imposed time frames of this sort?</p>
<p>(4) A large alteration in this package is the installation of a new Heavy UNREP system for Station 6 which will be a fully functional prototype. The Station 12 Heavy UNREP requirements are a "backbone" of equipment which will have to be modified in the future to become functional. The Heavy Unrep alterations will require removal of machinery and installation of foundations and equipment while the ship is on dock to support installation and testing schedules. Also, significant pier testing will be required once the installation is completed by the shipyard. How has your shipyard tested new UNREP systems in the past? Can your facilities accommodate the stretch testing required for completion of this work? A guide to testing is provided as Enclosure (1).</p>
<p>(5) This procurement will be solicited under NAICS 336611, Ship Building and Repair. Please indicate your business size status for this NAICS. Is your company a large or small business, and if a small business, do you fall within any of the further classifications (Hubzone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.)</p>
<p>Please provide your response to this Request for Information by COB 23 February 2011. Submissions should be made by email to Reyn.Schuttler@Navy.Mil. MSC has limitations on file sizes, so if the attached files are larger than a total of 3M, please submit via separate emails. Submission of a capabilities statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Government as to the extent of shipyards available for this procurement. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries, located in Panama City, FL intends to acquire 44 acoustic tags and receivers to upgrade VEMCO receivers. The smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) is currently listed as endangered in US waters under the US Endangered Species Act (ESA). Under the ESA, NOAA Fisheries Service is responsible for determining critical habitat for the species. Subsequently, NOAA Fisheries has sponsored additional research on the species, its habitat use, and its conservation needs. Additionally, NOAA Fisheries has developed a recovery plan for the species pursuant to section 4(f) of the ESA. Previous research on critical habitat utilized VEMCO VR2 receivers combined with acoustic tags. Transmitters offered must be able to be detected by the VEMCO receivers, thus allowing for smalltooth sawfish to occupy habitats that would undetectable and except VR2-Delrin black case as trade in.
<p>DESC: Purchase 44 acoustic tags and receivers: To be considered interested parties must be able to demonstrate their ability to provide receiver/tags that meets the following specification:<br /><br />The minimum functional requirements:</p>
<p>Depth Rating: 500 Meters</p>
<p>Battery Life: minimum 12 Months</p>
<p>Memory Capacity: &gt;7MB non-volatile Flash</p>
<p>Frequency: optimized for 69kHz</p>
<p>Decoding: able to decode all Vemco Coded transmitters on 69kHz</p>
<p>Interface: via Bluetooth using Vemco PC software</p>
<p>Time resolution: capable of time resolution on the order of 1msec</p>
<p>PC software: Compatible with Vemco's VUE software</p>
<p>Upgradeability: Firmware is field upgradeable using VUE software</p>
<p>Future expansion and code types: Programmable with Vemco code maps</p>
<p><br />The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source VEMCO. They are the only known company able to provide the tags and receiver to comply with the government existing VEMCO equipment. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 4510-00-NIB-0010<br />Name: Dispenser, Wall Mounted, Micrell Antibacterial Soap, 1000 mL, Dove Gray, Each<br />Description: Compact, wall mounted, Micrell antibacterial lotion soap dispenser with a one-hand push dispenser for 1,000 mL refills. This single unit dispenser is dove gray in color and has a unique dispensing valve with portion control to minimize <br />waste.</p>
<p>NSN: 4510-00-NIB-0011<br />Name: Dispenser, Wall Mounted, Micrell Antibacterial Soap, 1000 mL, Dove Gray,<br />6/case<br />Description: Compact, wall mounted, Micrell antibacterial lotion soap dispensers with a one-hand push dispenser for 1,000 mL refills.

<p>NSN: 4510-00-NIB-0012<br />Name: Dispenser, Wall Mounted, Micrell Antibacterial Soap, 2000 mL, Dove Gray,<br />Each<br />Description: Compact, wall mounted, Micrell antibacterial lotion soap dispenser with a one-hand push dispenser for 1,000 mL refills. This single unit dispenser is dove grayin color and has a unique dispensing valve with portion control to minimize <br />waste.</p>
<p>NSN: 4510-00-NIB-0013<br />Name: Dispenser, Wall Mounted, Micrell Antibacterial Soap, 2000 mL, Dove Gray,<br />8/case<br />Description: Compact, wall mounted, Micrell antibacterial lotion soap dispensers with a one-hand push dispenser for 1,000 mL refills. This case of 8 dispensers are dove grayin color and have a unique dispensing valve with portion control to minimize waste.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>None Reported</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302 and 5.2, this notice advertises the government's intent to award a non-competitive contract to Donald O'Brien for production of eight short films featuring National Park Service (NPS) scientists performing their work in the field.  The films will be produced from left-over "B Roll" footage shot during the original contract, awarded two years ago.  Donald is the sole owner of the footage, which makes Donald the only source.  Refer to justification below.  
Comments and questions regarding this announcement may be directed to Ed McKee, Contracting Officer, at ed_mckee@nps.gov.  All comments received before February 18, 2011 will be considered.  

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $100,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)
1.  Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost):Non-Competitive award to Donald O'Brien for production of eight short films featuring NPS scientists performing their work in the field.  Anticipated project is approximately $15,000.
2.  Sole Source Justification rationale  (Check one and explain below):__X__	Only one responsible source. _____  Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. Include critical delivery or performance dates, and when you became aware of the requirement.  Provide a specific statement of the impact on Government operations, financial or otherwise, if the required delivery or performance dates are not met. ______ Other   _____________________________________________________ 
Explain:
In 2009, the NPS awarded contract P9504090016 to Donald O'Brien for completion of eight short films featuring NPS scientists working in North Coast & Cascades Network parks.  In producing that original group of eight films, Donald retained unused "B Roll" footage, featuring additional personnel interviews, scenic views, and wildlife.  The NPS will award a new contract to Donald using the "B Roll" footage to produce another group of eight films.  This new group of eight films is considered a follow-on requirement to the original contract because the "B Roll" footage being used is one-of-a-kind, owned by Donald O'Brien, and no other entity, public or private, can access.  NPS only wants the final product, the completed eight films.  Donald is the only one with access to the footage as the original owner, and therefore is the only source.NPS was extremely satisfied with the quality of the original eight films that Donald produced.  Donald O'Brien has the experience, expertise, and capability of producing another group of eight films for the NPS, with minimum cost and effort.  No new site visits or additional videography will be required.  Donald will produce the new group of films solely from the available "B Roll" footage, of which he retained, and owns.  
3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest:
The original eight films cost $15,320.  The NPS has the unique opportunity, two years later, to procure another group of eight films at roughly the same price.  The NPS did not pursue seeking out additional sources because no other vendors have access to Donald's extra, unused "B Roll" footage from the previous contract.  Without that, a vendor would need to start from scratch, with all new footage, site visits, field interviews, etc.  This would significantly increase cost, and not meet the intent of the project, which is to keep costs at a minimum by using previously shot footage.  
4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:a.  Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist. b.  The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<DESC>The primary purpose of the Data-to-Decision (D2D) Program is to develop a capability to rapidly develop, evaluate, and field prototype Decision Support Systems. To accomplish this goal, the D2D program has identified the creation of a library of flexible modules that can be easily repurposed, or modified, to meet the needs of many National Security applications as a critical need. This library will form an open architecture basis for the rapid development of new prototype decision support systems. Additionally, the architecture should allow these modules to be rapidly reconfigured, should be sufficiently flexible to enable easy upgrades of existing modules and should allow insertion of new or alternative modules created by innovative organizations.
<p>Applicants shall apply under ONRBAA11-001.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) of the US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command proposes to procure, under contract number W911W6-11-P-0018, ten (10) Flightcell International DZM2 Communication Hubs, P/N: FCDZM200DIM; and fifteen (15) Iridium 9505/A Phone Cradles, P/N: FC9505/A38999M3M. This is a brand name only requirement and will be awarded to an authorized US based Flightcell International distributor.  Cost and Delivery timeline ARO will provide the primary evaluation factors with each of equal importance. The procurement will be issued on a Firm-Fixed-Price basis. <BR>The Rapid Prototyping Division of AATD designed and developed the upgrade for a limited number of currently fielded UH-60 helicopters utilizing SATCOM radio, LOS radio, and Iridium phone Command and Control (C2) capability.  These components have already been designed for, manufactured for, and integrated with previously fielded SATCOM Command and Control (C2) console systems, meet the performance and ruggedized environment requirements, and alleviate ALL technical risk toward meeting further fielded system integration success and schedule. Therefore, these products (manufactured by Flightcell) are the recommended solution to provide the required satellite-based cell phone communication link for the C2 requirements. The integration of any similarly, but not completely, capable Iridium assembly would adversely impact technical risk and schedule and as such potentially harm the Government. As mentioned, the Flightcell assembly elements have the added benef t in that no other such assembly has been previously integrated on specific Army rotary wing aircraft for this application and the associated design documentation and qualification testing required to substantiate performance and airworthiness of any other such component precludes meeting the project schedule.<BR>No other manufacturer source other than Flightcell is known that produces the necessary components which meet both the technical performance and commonality requirements. Further, new similar components, if available, will certainly require communications console mechanical and electrical redesign. This necessitates additional individual airworthiness approval of another kit element during a critical compressed installation timeline for deployed troops.<BR>The urgency requirements dictated by this support project to PM Airborne Battle Command Program Support Office (ABC PSO) (formerly, Army Airborne Command and Control Systems (A2C2S)), the experience with the known hardware source (Flightcell), the anticipated delivery schedule of the hardware (available usually for delivery 4 to 6 weeks ARO), and the established mating of the airborne communications console mount and electrical harness hardware are key elements of this procurement. For these reasons, it is cost effective for the Govemment to procure these particular commercially available Iridium components. <BR>AATD intends to award a purchase order for commericial items as defined by FAR Part 12. This is a brand name only requirement.  This procurement will be solicited, evaluated, and awarded using FAR Part 13 procedures for simplified acquisitions. This requirement is under NAICS code 423690, Other Electronic Parts and Equipment Merchant Wholesalers. Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to this procurement described are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. Delivery, Inspection/Acceptance and FOB of these items is intended for the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, Fort Eustis, Virginia 23604. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability by responding to this requirement and submitting a quote.  Existing product literature generally available in industry should be submitted with your quote.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal that will be considered.  A solicitation document is not available.  Proposals are due 11 February 2011, 2:00 PM, E.S.T.  Submit inquiries regarding this procurement to AATD.  Points of contact are Michael Leonard, (757)878-0086 or via e-mail michael.h.leonard@us.army.mil or Kenneth Helms, (757)878-5909 or via e-mail ken.helms@us.army.mil. <BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>Solicitation # W91LV2SYRACUSE is hereby issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) for lodging during the period of 10-13 February 2011 in the Syracuse, NY area. This procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside. Only small businesses under NAICS Code 721110 are being solicited resulting in a COMPETITIVELY awarded purchase order contract. The small business size standard for NAICS code 721110 is $30,000,000 or less. <BR>Note: The small business size standard for Hotels has recently been increased from $7.5 M to $30 M.  All vendors are requested to update their CCR records to reflect any changes that may be necessary to reflect their current size standard. <BR><BR>The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to provide contracted services as set forth below and in the attachments.<BR><BR>The anticipated award will be a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP)-type contract.

<p>JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES<br />The Office of Criminal Justice Assistance and Partnerships (INL/CAP) is part of the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) at the US Department of State. The Bureau is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination, and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State. INL/CAP provides policy guidance and assists INL program offices in addressing the full range of criminal justice issues as they relate to police development programs globally.</p>
<p>INL/CAP also manages the bureau's policy and activities in support of international policing in peacekeeping operations and is the bureau's conduit to the United Nations and other multilateral organizations on this topic.</p>
<p>Police are a critically important element of UN peacekeeping operations, as evidenced by the 10 fold growth in police authorized for UN missions over the past 15 years. Recognizing the increased complexity of the roles that "police peacekeepers" play, as well as the growing demand for police peacekeepers, INL/CAP actively supports its own program and the efforts of the United Nations (UN) to improve the quality and timeliness of police deployed to UN missions. However, there still exists a critical gap in the deployment of well-trained, well-equipped police peacekeepers. In an effort to enhance the operational capacity of police peacekeepers in mission and to help multilateral organizations and police contributing countries (PCCs) deploy them more quickly, INL/CAP developed the International Police Peacekeeping Operation Support (IPPOS) program which provides training and equipment to PCCs. IPPOS is one of the few new programs this year to receive the endorsement of Secretary Clinton.</p>

<p>&nbsp;NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS-United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timely consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protestor essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns with the USCG as an Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of a informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman; solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Forman Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protestors must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protestor's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protestor may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternate to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless the contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, DC 20593-0001, FAX:202-475-3904.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS -</strong> United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study for an Electronic Health Records Project in Jordan.</p>
<p>Although Jordan is considered to be a center of excellence with a comparatively high level of medical care, further modernization in its healthcare ICT system is needed. In order to achieve improvements in healthcare information management, His Majesty King Abdullah II set out a vision to computerize the public healthcare system in 2008. As part of this vision, Jordan is currently undertaking a pilot implementation of the highly praised U.S. Veterans Administration's (VA) VistA Hospital Information System under a pilot project entitled "Hakeem." The program aims to improve health service delivery to all Jordanians, provide a channel for electronic communication between citizens and healthcare professionals, and allow patients, their families, and healthcare professionals to access up-to-date information.</p>
<p>The Hakeem pilot project is managed by a non- profit Jordanian company, Electronic Health Solutions (EHS). The pilot phase involves three sites: Prince Hamzah Hospital (PHH), King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC), and Amman Comprehensive Clinic (ACC). EHS has provided the hospitals and the clinic with the needed infrastructure to implement the solution, including data centers, hardware, networking (based on NBN - National Broadband Network), software licenses, support teams, and IT &amp; business professional services.</p>
<p>The Feasibility Study will develop an objective evaluation of the pilot project results and provide recommendations for a business plan for EHS to expand the electronic health records system throughout Jordan. The Study will include collecting and evaluating pre-pilot data (the Grantee will support and facilitate the collection of the pre-pilot data by providing 2 staff members to assist with collecting the necessary data), gathering post-pilot data, analyzing results, developing a preliminary technical and financial analysis of an electronic records expansion, and training EHS staff on maintenance of the system. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the project's success will not only improve Jordan's healthcare system domestically, but will also aid in establishing Jordan as a preeminent healthcare provider for the Middle East region.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $567,605 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM Local Time, March 8, 2011 at the above address and email address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The Department of Veterans Affairs Nebraska Western Iowa Health Care System (NWIHCS) intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) sole source contract with Aspire Consulting, PO Box 22138, Saint Paul, MN 55122 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) FAC 2005-22. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  A justification for other than full and open competition is being prepared in support of this acquisition.

The VHA Network 23 Leadership continues to target career development and leadership training as an ongoing priority area for succession planning.  In 2002 the Network Education Product Line introduced a Network Leadership Development program (LEAD).  The LEAD program is targeted toward competitively selected "high potential" mid-level managers to participate in an 18-month leadership development program which includes individual and team learning, moves to learning with mentor guidance and support, and finishes with individual accountability through participation in an assigned project.  The desired outcome of this initiative is that mid level managers will acquire new or enhanced leadership skills, knowledge and / or behaviors to apply to their current or future roles.  This leadership development initiative increases the leadership "bench strength" of the network.  The current vendor is the only one to have responded to a previous request for proposal, meeting initial project specifications in 2002.  As a result, they have gained a depth of experience with the culture of Network 23 as well as a good understanding of the current leadership skills and gaps.  This experience is critical in assisting with the development of future programs that support the need for enhancement of staff leadership skills.  This is a continuation of an existing project. 

THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  NAICS Code 611430, with a size standard of $7.0 million applies to this procurement.  All proposals received by 4:00 P.M. Central Time, Friday, February 11, 2011, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by mail, or by facsimile at (402) 449-0612.

There is an increasing emphasis in VHA supporting the development of teams in all areas.  In this effort, the VISN 23 Education Product Line has targeted team development as a priority for the coming years.  This focus is in response to the growth of teams in health care and the priority of newly formed National Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT).  The VISN 23 Team Development Model provides a structured approach for developing new teams and providing consultation and coaching for existing teams to enhance their effectiveness and productivity.  The key element of the Team Development Model is the Team Effectiveness Coach (TEC).  The goal is to have 2 - 4 TECs trained and certified at each facility in VISN 23 to provide a consistent support system for learning distribution and ongoing reinforcement.  An instructional design consultant is being sought to design and develop a Team Effectiveness Coach (TEC) Certification Program that will provide an interactive experience to learn facilitation, training and coaching skills as well as understand the foundations of team effectiveness.  The consultant will also design and develop a one day workshop on the foundations of team effectiveness to be used in launching new teams throughout the network.  

The consultant will work directly with the VISN 23 Education Product Line to design and develop learning modules to provide training and certification for Team Effectiveness Coaches and team effectiveness training for newly forming teams.  The consultant will integrate a team effectiveness measurement tool to track team activity and progress associated with this learning strategy.  The consultant will also design and manage a Team Effectiveness Sharepoint site to support the sharing of best practices across teams, provide team recognition, and a team development "library" of tools and staff meetings, and ongoing dialogue through "team chat" as a tool to reinforce development and success.

Deliverables:  Team Effectiveness Coach Certification (individual assessment, team assessment, participant workbook, content presentation and facilitation, facilitator guide, learner-centered training checklist), Foundations of Team Effectiveness (individual assessment reports, team assessment reports, facilitator guide, participant workbook, presentation and facilitation, Team Effectiveness SharePoint (base SharePoint platform creation, monthly maintenance and regular monitoring). 

Estimated workload (313.5 hours total):  Design and develop curriculum for TEC Certification Workshop (280 hours); Facilitate TEC Certification Workshop (3 day program presentation, presented twice) - 48 hours; Design and develop curriculum for Team Effectiveness Program - 170 hours; Facilitate pilot training and roll out facilitation - 56 hours; Create a base platform for team effectiveness in SharePoint - 100 hours; Monthly maintenance and monitoring of SharePoint - 25 hours.

THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  NAICS Code 611430, with a size standard of $7.0 million applies to this procurement.  All proposals received by 4:00 P.M. Central Time, Friday, February 11, 2011, will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The Department of Veterans Affairs Nebraska Western Iowa Health Care System (NWIHCS) intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) sole source contract with Sparkpoint, Inc., 1001 Office Park Road, Des Moines, IA 50265, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) FAC 2005-22. Only one responsible source is known at this time to satisfy agency requirements.  A justification for other than full and open competition is being prepared in support of this acquisition.

The VISN 23 Physician Leadership Development Program is currently being restructured and expanded to include other clinical disciplines interested in pursuing learning experiences to enhance their leadership skills to prepare them for assuming positions of increasing administrative responsibility.  There is a noticeable absence of a comprehensive and integrated approach to providing leadership development for potential leaders across all clinical disciplines in VISN 23.  The need has been identified to design a clinical leadership development program that will:  build upon the foundation previous leadership courses have provided; expand instruction to include other clinical leaders not just physicians; enable continuity of instruction and expectations of learning; provide a highly interactive, content rich learning experience focused on immediate real world applications; be instructionally and skill-appropriate for those with and without managerial experience; identify additional learning opportunities between formal learning events; and develop the unique potential of the members of the VISNs clinical leadership. 

The VISN 23 Education Product Line is seeking an educational consultant to design and develop the curriculum for the Clinical Leadership Institute incorporating the latest theories and concepts related to leadership and team development.  Strategies for content development will be based on adult learning principles and state of the art learning methodologies.  The consultant is expected to possess the following qualifications:  MA degree or higher in Teaching, Education or Instructional Design; Experience consulting with leadership, management and front line teams; Experience consulting with and developing programs in VA healthcare; Experience in developing courses in leadership, management, communication skills, team development, innovation and change management, coaching, professionalism and attitude, project management; Experience developing custom courses for larger organizations; Certified in one or more personality, preference or performance inventories such as MBTI, SDI, DISC, etc.; Experience in developing highly interactive learning sessions that are practical and immediately transferable to the job; Experience in conducting formal needs assessments and reporting; Experience in developing rubrics and other authentic performance assessments; 15 years experience at a minimum.  Additionally, the consultant should be centrally located within VISN 23 geography to facilitate frequent planning and design meetings with the Clinical Leadership Institute planning committee.  

The consultant shall work directly with the VISN 23 Education Product Line to design and develop 4 learning modules to be presented as face to face learning sessions.  Content will be developed incorporating learning strategies consistent with adult learning principles including but not limited to hands on activities such as:  simulations, case studies, discussions, concept attainment activities, panel discussions, best practices sharing, learning relays, teach back sessions, and culminating learning projects within and between learning sessions.  

Estimated workload (313.5 hours total):  Research and Identify assessment and inventory tools - 13.5 hours; Instructional design for course content and learning activities - 300 hours. 

THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  NAICS Code 611430, with a size standard of $7.0 million applies to this procurement.  All proposals received by 4:00 P.M. Central Time, Friday, February 11, 2011, will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>1. Does the 130dB "useful amplification" refer to the total receiver gain and pulser gain?
<p>2. Or does the 130dB refer to the full dynamic range on a single A-scan (max signal divided by noise floor)?</p>
<p>Answer to both: As stated, the total useful transmitted signal shall be capable of transmitting 130 db which shall be accomplished with increased pulser power. 600 v. minimum, for TTU. Only to be used in cases of highly attenuative parts. This can be measured by pulse received from TTU. Normally not obtainable with a 500 v pulser.</p>

BACKGROUNDThe Bechler Ranger (Soldier) Station was established in 1910 in a remote outpost that was occupied by the US Army to help curb the growing threat of illegal hunting in the park. The Ranger Station is located in the most remote location within the lower 48 United States. Today the National Park Service (NPS) operates the facility from May until November (due to the severity of the winters). It functions as a public contact area for hikers, backpackers, fishermen and tour groups. Approximately six rangers reside at the facility during the summer season.
SCOPE OF WORK Currently, the NPS facilities depend on a 20 KW propane generator to supply all electrical requirements. The generator operates 24 hours a day from early May until late October. The generator powers a large well pump for supplying potable water for employees and visitors as well as providing water for the fire suppression system. Additionally, all employee residences and a public contact station are powered by the generator. In the past, the park examined the feasibility of installing a photovoltaic system that would reduce the dependency of the propane generator. Due to the severe winter months, it was realized that the batteries would have to be removed from the area every fall and re-installed every spring.  The permanently installed solar panels would be subjected to very heavy snow loads (up to 10ft) and would also have to be disconnected every fall. As a result, it was determined that a permanent photovoltaic system would not be practical.
Through technological advances, various companies now produce state-of-art photovoltaic systems that are portable. The solar panels are mounted on the roof of an enclosed trailer that houses the battery bank; all switch gear, DC/AC inverter and a high efficiency backup propane generator. This application would be ideal for the Bechler Ranger Station, as the trailer would be moved out of the area during the winter months and used in different areas of the park where winters are not as severe. It is anticipated that the trailer unit will provide over 80% renewable energy for the Bechler complex. This will result in an estimated reduction of over 21 metric tons of green house gases, annually.
Over 5,000 visitors enjoy the Bechler area every summer; hence the park will have a tremendous opportunity to inform/educate visitors on the environmental attributes of producing electricity from the sun. It is envisioned that this project will serve as a model for other remote sites within Yellowstone NP and other national parks within the United States. Lastly, the trailer will be used during the winter months in a variety of venues throughout the Yellowstone region that will result in high visibility benefits. This will include special park headquarters events, traveling to various high schools and universities within Montana, Idaho and Wyoming and regional gateway community functions.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>The Government Evaluation Team may use all methods available to evaluate prices proposed including, but not limited to, an analysis based on the following:</p>
<p>Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to representative industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.</p>
<p>Realism: A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity in each contractor's proposed price proposal.

<p>The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:</p>
<p>The Government Evaluation Team members will independently rate the strengths and <br />weaknesses of each Offeror's technical proposal information. Each of the developed <br />evaluation factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, or Un- <br />acceptable, with Outstanding representing the highest possible rating and Unacceptable<br />representing the lowest possible rating. Only the Past Performance factor may be rated <br />as neutral. The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:</p>
<p>&bull; OUTSTANDING - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to contribute to the <br />Superior achievement of the objectives with minimal or no risk. An assigned rating of <br />OUTSTANDING indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, sub factor, or element,<br />the submission contains very significant strengths and no weaknesses.<br />&bull; GOOD - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal risk in <br />achieving the objectives. A GOOD rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, <br />sub factor, or element, the submission contains considerable strengths, but also some <br />weaknesses.<br />&bull; ACCEPTABLE - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal to<br />moderate risk in achieving the objectives. An ACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms <br />of the specific factor, the submission contains weaknesses that offset strengths, but do not<br />significantly detract from the submission. A rating of ACCEPTABLE is used when there <br />are no indications of exceptional features or innovations that could prove to be beneficial <br />and no major weaknesses that could diminish the quality of the effort or increase the risks <br />of failure.<br />&bull; UNACCEPTABLE - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce moderate<br />To excessive risk making it highly unlikely that performance would meet the objectives. <br />An UNACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, sub factor, <br />or element, the submission contains significant weaknesses that are not offset by strengths. <br />The Offeror's interpretation of the Government's objective is superficial, incomplete, <br />vague, incompatible, incomprehensible or incorrect that it is considered unacceptable.<br />&bull; NEUTRAL* - No relevant past performance available for evaluation.<br />* This rating shall only be applied to the PAST PERFORMANCE factor. A NEUTRAL<br />rating is neither favorable nor unfavorable.</p>
<p>Assigned ratings will reflect the consensus developed by the evaluation team's assessment <br />of the technical proposal for accomplishing the Government's objectives.</p>
<p>Price proposals will be evaluated but not rated.</p>

The risk assessment work could be performed for a project anywhere in the United States.   It is not known at this time which districts outside of the Tulsa District might or might not utilize this contract.   <BR><BR>Question 2:<BR>Will there be weights or rankings for the elements of the primary selection criteria?<BR>Answer 2:<BR>Per AFARS 5115.304(b)(2)(D), numerical weighting (i.e., assigning points or percentages to evaluation factors) is not an authorized method of expressing the relative importance of factors.  In accordance with DFARS 236.602-1(a), the selection criteria have been listed in their relative order of importance.  No numerical weights or rankings will be applied.  As stated in the announcement, the selection criteria for this synopsis are listed in descending order of importance, with Criteria A through D being the primary selection criteria, and Criteria E through F being secondary criteria.  Secondary criteria will be used as "tie-breakers" ONLY if the application of criteria A through D result in firms being rated as technically equal.  The primary selection criteria, listed in descending order of importance, are: A.  Professional Qualifications, B.  Specialized Experience and Technical Competence, C.  Sufficient Capacity, D.  Past Performance.  See the original announcement for details about each of these factors.<BR><BR>All questions should be submitted in writing ONLY to the Contract Specialist Ms. Lee Ann White at lee.ann.white@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>POC Nina Patel, USTDA<br />1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600<br />Arlington, VA 22209-3901 <br />Tel: (703) 875-4357<br />Fax: (703) 875-4009 <br />***Please do not contact contracts office***
<p><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br />Mr. Ghassan Al-Lahham<br />CEO, Electronic Health Solutions<br />King Abdullah II Bin Al Hussein Street<br />Mecca Street Cross Circle<br />King Hussein Business Park<br />P.O. Box 4408<br />Amman 11953<br />Jordan<br />Tel: 962 6 5800 461/ 962 7 9558 9777<br />Ceo@Ehs.Com.Jo</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study for an Electronic Health Records Project in Jordan.</p>
<p>Although Jordan is considered to be a center of excellence with a comparatively high level of medical care, further modernization in its healthcare ICT system is needed. In order to achieve improvements in healthcare information management, His Majesty King Abdullah II set out a vision to computerize the public healthcare system in 2008. As part of this vision, Jordan is currently undertaking a pilot implementation of the highly praised U.S. Veterans Administration's (VA) VistA Hospital Information System under a pilot project entitled "Hakeem." The program aims to improve health service delivery to all Jordanians, provide a channel for electronic communication between citizens and healthcare professionals, and allow patients, their families, and healthcare professionals to access up-to-date information.</p>
<p>The Hakeem pilot project is managed by a non- profit Jordanian company, Electronic Health Solutions (EHS). The pilot phase involves three sites: Prince Hamzah Hospital (PHH), King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC), and Amman Comprehensive Clinic (ACC). EHS has provided the hospitals and the clinic with the needed infrastructure to implement the solution, including data centers, hardware, networking (based on NBN - National Broadband Network), software licenses, support teams, and IT &amp; business professional services.</p>
<p>The Feasibility Study will develop an objective evaluation of the pilot project results and provide recommendations for a business plan for EHS to expand the electronic health records system throughout Jordan. The Study will include collecting and evaluating pre-pilot data (the Grantee will support and facilitate the collection of the pre-pilot data by providing 2 staff members to assist with collecting the necessary data), gathering post-pilot data, analyzing results, developing a preliminary technical and financial analysis of an electronic records expansion, and training EHS staff on maintenance of the system. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the project's success will not only improve Jordan's healthcare system domestically, but will also aid in establishing Jordan as a preeminent healthcare provider for the Middle East region.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $567,605 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>

<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.

Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.

<DESC>AFRL Space Experiments &amp; Programs Branch (RVEP) is pleased to announce that it intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for its next major space flight experiment in the next 3-6 months. An intensive review of many candidate technologies has been conducted, and two concepts were chosen for our BAA; one or both concepts will be selected for execution. The two concepts are Advanced Missile Warning Sensors Experiment (AMWSE) and the Advanced eXperiment In Orbital Manipulation (AXIOM).<br /><br />AMWSE will characterize space-based advanced missile warning sensor technologies. This technology promises great potential for multiple military needs.<br /><br />AXIOM is an experiment designed to demonstrate new uses for advanced solar array technologies combined with advanced Hall Effect thrusters. The AXIOM baseline is for a single high-power, lightweight solar array wing and a single Hall thruster implemented on a small spacecraft bus, though an implementation with two wings and two thrusters may be considered. Extensive orbital maneuvering will be accomplished at altitudes that may range from low Earth orbit through Geostationary orbit. <br /><br />RVEP plans to host a Briefing for Industry (BFI) prior to release of the BAA. The objectives of the briefing will be to acquaint industry with information regarding how AFRL conducts flight experiments, provide additional technical information on the two experiments being considered, and receive industry input. This BFI will be beneficial in determining the basis for the acquisition strategy, which has not been finalized. <br /><br />Further details regarding this upcoming&nbsp;BFI will be posted in the near future as an update to this notice. The FedBizOpps website has a feature on this page where you can register to receive email notifications of any updates. If you choose not to register for these automatic e-mail update notices you can continue to check this website for further updates.

<DESC>This is an amendment to change the response date to 14 February 2011.<BR><BR>AMRDEC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Puerto Rico to further develop the Aviation System Assessment Program (ASAP)on-line tool in the area of Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA).  The proposed acquisition is direct to the University of Puerto Rico, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Any source other than the University of Puerto Rico would require substantial duplication of time and cost to the Government, neither of which would be recovered through the additional competition, and unacceptable delay would also be incurred in fulfilling the Government's requirement.  A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract will be used.  The period of performance will consist of 8 months from date of award.<BR><BR>The Contractor shall develop a web-based Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) module that is assessable through the Aviation System Assessment Program (ASAP) Database that is capable of importing FMECAs for each aviation platform and storing those CMECAs in a standard format.  The FMECA module shall be capable of exporting FMECAs and relating those FMECAs to the correct Work Unit Code (component) within the ASAP Database.  The FMECA module shall also display specific FMECA information (Failure Rates, Severity Class, etc.) for a specific Work Unit Code when requested.  The Contractor shall develop the functionality to track modifications to existing FMECAs.  The Contractor shall also investigate the process needed to use information from the ASAP Database to create new FMECAs.  The Contractor shall provide a report outlining the Website design, screen layouts, and FMECA to ASAP output requirements.  The Contractor shall provide a report outlining the Query definitions within the FMECA module to the results of testing the Query definitions using available data.  The Contractor shall provide a report showing the results of the software functionality development and testing.   The Contractor shall provide software drops as required by the Government to the ASAP Database developer so the software can be incrementally reviewed before it is installed on an U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center AMRDEC server.  This is not a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquires and/or responses will not be accepted.<BR>Attn:  Any communication related to this acquisition should be directed to<BR>US Army Aviation and Missile Command<BR>ATTN: Tracy J.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extended until February 11, 2011 2:00 p.m. PST.<br /></span><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations and Field Studies (DSHEFS) has a requirement for follow-on support for the Endicott Retrospective Chemical Exposure Assessment.
<p>NIOSH is conducting an epidemiologic cohort study of a former IBM plant located at Endicott, New York, that has produced a variety of microelectronic components as well as equipment associated with accounting, printing and computing machines. A chemical exposure assessment is needed in conjunction with the epidemiologic study. Electronic data as well as hard-copy documents containing information related to potential chemical exposure have been obtained by NIOSH from the former operator of the site. These records contain information generated by the Endicott site industrial hygiene organization through the past several decades. The records do not cover the entire period of the study and the data contained are not directly suitable for determination of worker exposures suitable for epidemiologic study. An exposure assessment database is being developed by NIOSH to combine the electronic records and data coded from the hard copy records to make these data available for study. The goal of the epidemiology study is to determine if associations exist between employment at the site and certain health outcomes. The study will additionally attempt to determine whether associations exist between these health outcomes and the type of exposure potentially experienced by workers.</p>
<p>The goal of the exposure assessment is to use historical site records, and other appropriate information, to identify important chemical agents which have been used at the site, to develop categories to group individuals with similar potential for exposure over time, and to associate the study cohort of site workers with these exposure-based categories so that exposure-based epidemiologic analyses can be performed. The Endicott retrospective chemical exposure assessment was begun in 2009 and is planned for completion in 2011.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Denise Rains, Purchasing Agent, Reference: 2011-Q-13185, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Acquisition and Assistance Field Branch (Spokane), 315 East Montgomery Avenue, Spokane, WA or email dgr8@cdc.gov. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.<br /><br />The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis announcements are issued to assist the Agency in performing market research to determine industry interest and capability. This Source Sought Synopsis is not a request for proposals and at this time, no solicitation exists. Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION. Introduction: The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking interested sources capable of providing App-DNA software product. Background: DTRA's mission is to safeguard America and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear) and high-yield explosives by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate, and counter the threat and mitigate its effects. The objective of the future solicitation is to acquire App-DNA Software Application where it will be used to automate pre-migration application testing and intelligently remediates compatibility issues. Product: The AppTitude application software platform can accelerate application testing and remediation for windows 7, application virtualization and application management projects. Some of the key featured benefits for using this application are: Self-provisioning - facilitates even more automation of the application delivery process and streamlines the application request process from business application owner to low-touch packaging, deployment and testing. Reporting via web client - Management, clients and global team members have easier and faster access to AppTitude reports, and broader support for multiple users. It can also provide deep interrogation, intelligent remediation, action-based reporting, heuristic analyis, full customization, total estate coverage and package generation. The App-DNA product was selected to provide interoperability with existing computer software and infrasturcture and most importantly cost effectiveness in regards to minimizing migratin compatibility issues. Responses: Interested offerors should address in their written response whether they can fulfill this requirement via a GSA schedule, NASA SEWP, NIH, or open market. Responses shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, email address, business size and small business status (such as disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, Woman Owned, Minority Owned, and/or Veteran Owned). Please submit responses to Tony Sixon, Contract Specialist via email at antonio.sixon@dtra.mil no later than 12:00PM (Eastern Standard Time) on February 11, 2011. Mr. Sixon is the point of contact for all inquiries regarding this action and can be reached at (703) 767-7892.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Bonita Hanes, 8824 Ridge Road, Bethesda, MD 20817-3258 to provide professional services to the NIDCR Division of Intramural Research (DIR).</p>
<p>The NIDCR DIR has a need for a non-affiliated member of the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC).  According to US Code Title 7-Agriculture, Chapter 54-Transportation, Sale, and Handling of Certain Animals (Regulations promulgated by the Animal Welfare Act), and the Public Health Service Policy on Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Policy promulgated by the Health Research Extension Act of 1985, Public Law 99-158), each law requires the Chief Institutional Officer to appoint a member of the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) that is not affiliated with the institution except as a member of the committee.  This member is intended to provide representation for general community interests in the proper care and treatment of animals.</p>
<p>The non-affiliated member will attend assigned ACUC meetings to participate in the reviewing process of Animal Study Proposals (ASPs), amendments thereof, semiannual reports, standard operating procedures, guidelines, etc. as presented in an assigned meeting agenda.  In addition to assigned meetings, the non-affiliated member will attend inspections of NIH laboratory animal housing facilities where NIDCR laboratory animals are housed.</p>
<p>The non-affiliated member is responsible for reviewing all items (animal study proposals and amendments, standard operating procedures, and guidelines) submitted for approval to the committee and commenting on them at the monthly meeting. The non-affiliated member is a full voting member of the ACUC and has the unique responsibility for ensuring that the animal study proposal 'objectives' section is understandable to the non-scientific public. The member will receive the printed ACUC agenda and copies of submissions one week prior to a meeting and review the content beforehand. The member is required to evaluate and comment on the submitted ASPs, and related documents and issues brought before the committee.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that Ms. Hanes has extensive experience working with the NIDCR ACUC for the past two years.  Her specific experience with the committee has allowed her to have a great understanding of the need for the use of animals in research to promote human health.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be from the contract award date through 12/31/11 with potential option years 1-4.</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), Bethesda, MD.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690 and is a small business set aside. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-49 (January 24, 2011).</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by February 11, 2011 at 3:00pm Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements.</p>
<p>Inquiries to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(DE)-2011-097-JML, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions,   COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6151, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Jonathan Lear.  Responses may be submitted electronically to learj@nhlbi.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.</p>

<RESPDATE>032511
<CONTACT>Pearlette Merriweather, Contracting Officer, Email pearlette.merriweather@nrc.gov - Joseph Widdup, Contracting Officer/Branch Chief, Email Joseph.Widdup@nrc.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain maintenance and operational support services for an estimated 100 U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) application systems and information technology (IT) environments, as well as modernization support and documentation support through fiscal year (FY) 2021 at an estimated cost of $237 million.&nbsp; A previous sources sought notice was posted to <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a> for this acquisition (<a href="https://www.fbo.gov/spg/NRC/OA/DCPM/NRC-10-33-MOM/listing.html">https://www.fbo.gov/spg/NRC/OA/DCPM/NRC-10-33-MOM/listing.html</a>), and the results of the Government's analysis of that sources sought notice have been considered in developing the acquisition strategy for this acquisition.<br /><br />This acquisition is a follow-on to the current "Maintenance and Operational Support of NRC Application Systems" contract, for which the incumbent contractor is OAO Corporation; the incumbent contract number is DR-33-07-358 and related task orders.&nbsp; That contract expires on March 25, 2011 but has two additional six-month options to extend the term of the contract.<br /><br />The 10-year period of performance for this new acquisition provides 7 years for the modernization and maintenance of NRC's applications portfolio plus up to 3 years of contractor award terms that are tied to contractor performance.<br /><br />This acquisition is intended to be a multiple award, partial small business set-aside acquisition along functional area lines (some functional areas will be full and open competition, and others will be small business set-aside) that will result in award of multiple indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity&nbsp;(IDIQ) contracts&nbsp;under which firm-fixed-price, labor-hour or time-and-materials task orders may be negotiated and awarded.<br /><br />Unrestricted Full and Open Competition (F&amp;OC) functional areas in the solicitation will include:<br /><br />&nbsp;- Initial maintenance of legacy systems<br /><br />&nbsp;- Centralized environment support<br /><br />&nbsp;- Requirements and Design<br /><br />Note: Based on information currently available, it is estimated that the value of thes&nbsp;F&amp;OC&nbsp;services is approximately $97 million.<br /><br /><br />Small Business Set-Aside (SBSA) functional areas in the solicitaiton will include:<br /><br />&nbsp;- Legacy modernization and new software application development<br /><br />&nbsp;- Maintenance of modernized systems<br /><br />Note: Based on information currently available, it is estimated that the value of the SBSA services is approximately $140 million.<br /><br /><br />The evaluation factors for the non-set aside portion of the acquisition will include a Subcontracting Plan Evaluation Factor, which incentivizes offerors that are not small businesses.&nbsp; The acquisition will also include an "on-ramp/off-ramp" feature that provides flexibility in managing the agency's future requirements.&nbsp; NRC anticipates a single solicitation that will utilize&nbsp;a best value tradeoff source selection process for each of the functional areas identified above.&nbsp; This process will result in the award of multiple IDIQ contracts for all functional areas.&nbsp; The NRC anticipates cost/price and non-cost/price factors to be approximately equal in importance for each&nbsp;functional area when evaluating offers and selecting awardee(s) for those functional areas.<br /><br />After IDIQ contracts are awarded,&nbsp;individual requirements in those functional areas (except for Centralized Environment Support, wihich is intended to have only one awardee) will be competed among the awardees in those functional areas, with the result being a task order award based on that competition.&nbsp; The multiple-award, partial small business set-aside strategy will facilitate competition and maximize opportunities for small businesses over the potential 10-year contract period.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is expected as the legacy systems are retired over the course of this new acquisition, the need for services under the unrestricted full and open competition areas will decrease.&nbsp; In addition, over time, as NRC modernizes its systems, the need for legacy modernizaiton, software application development and maintenance of modernized systems services in the SBSA functional areas will grow.<br /><br />NRC will consider the question of organizational conflicts of interest (OCOI) for this acquisition, in accordance with NRC Acquisition Regulation (NRCAR) Subpart 2009.5, and will ensure compliance with OCOI requirements with regard to placement of resulting contract awards.<br /><br />The solicitation and related amendments will only be made available from this web site.&nbsp; Therefore, potential offerors are encouraged to monitor <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a> for information or amendments relating to this solicitation.&nbsp; The NRC currently anticipates posting the solicitation on or about February 23, 2011, with proposals due by the response date indicated in this notice.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Special Operations Research, Development, and Acquisition Center (SORDAC), Directorate of Procurement intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Submergence Group, LLC, 4 Water Street, Chester, CT 06412 in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304c(1) and FAR 6.302-1. A research study is required for the testing and evaluation of a commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) diver lock-in/lock-out dry submersible test platform with an American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) classed submersible. This study is integral to the overall acquisition strategy of employing a User Operational Evaluation System (UOES) to minimize cost and technical risks and fully evaluate the concept for a suitable Special Operations Forces (SOF) Dry Combat Submersible (DCS). The contractor shall provide an ABS classed, operational diver lock-in/lock-out dry submersible test platform, capable of demonstrating cited attributes under controlled operating conditions: (1) capable of locking out at least six divers in a single lock-in/lock-out cycle; (2) capable of a sustained, two- hour submerged speed of five knots or greater; (3) capable of transiting at least 10 nautical miles at five knots on a single battery charge; (4) capable of conducting three short duration tests, three or more hours per test per week, and one long duration test, six or more hours per test per week; (5) capable of integration with a surface host to conduct surface ship launches and recoveries; and (6) small enough to integrate with, insert into, and withdraw from a modified Dry Deck Shelter (DDS) simulator. The contractor shall design, install, integrate, support, test, and maintain temporary SOF Modifications and Risk Mitigation Modifications utilizing GFE to permit the government to more accurately evaluate the impact of GFE on capabilities of submersibles of this size. Upon completion of the study, the contractor shall be responsible for all associated demilitarization to return the DCS UOES test platform to its original state to include delivery to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The period of the study shall be one 12-month base year plus two 12-month optional periods, not to exceed 36 months. Based on market survey results, Submergence Group's S301 is the only known and available submersible meeting the Government's test profiles for diver lock-in/lock-out sustained submerged speeds, transiting distance, DDS integration pursuant to ABS classification. These requirements are paramount and cannot be waived. Submergence Group is the original manufacturer of the S301 and has working knowledge of sustaining ABS classification. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal no later than five days of the posting that shall be considered by the agency. The Government intends to award a combination Firm-Fixed Price, and Cost-Plus-Type contract for performance to begin on or about 28 March 2011.

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS POST-AWARD NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO PRESIDIO NETWORKED SOLUTIONS, INC. FOR THE REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW.

In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, Pub.L. 111-5, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) posts this notice of issuance of modification 0045 to Delivery Order 0731 of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) that was awarded to Presidio Networked Solutions, Inc. for the consolidated purchase of various International Business Machine (IBM) software licenses and maintenance.  This purchase will provide an additional 47 Millions of Service Units (MSU), upgraded license capacity and maintenance through September 30, 2011, to IBM software the IRS already owns.  In meeting the spirit of ARRA, the modification has been executed as a firm-fixed price action to a previously competed BPA awarded to Presidio Networked Solutions, Inc., a small business.

These upgrades are needed to support new workloads in the IRS mainframe environment.  Mission critical tax applications will be affected by the changes implemented by the ARRA such that increased workload volumes and changes will require additional processing resources.  The increased workloads include processing new Business Master File (BMF) tax forms and handling increased volumes of queries to support customer interactions with the IRS for other tax application systems.  This acquisition will provide the software licenses and maintenance for the additional processor capacity required to process the new workloads.

All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.<br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have &#10063; have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have &#10063;, have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has &#10063; has not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious,or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
