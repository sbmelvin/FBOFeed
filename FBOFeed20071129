[SPECIFICATIONS] The specifications are: 23520-200 SC8000HS InSb 1024x1024 f/4.0 Camera SC8000HS 1024x1024 Camera AC Power Supply USB Cable 2 Calibration Plates Graphic User Interface Shipping/Carrying Case Operating Manual (2)	23898-000 25 mm InSb lens, 3.0-5.0 micron bandpass f/4.0, Bayonet Mount Optical Interface (3)	23899-000 50mm InSb lens, 3.0-5.0 micron bandpass f/4.0, Bayonet Mount Optical Interface (4)	ThermoVision SC8000 SDK (5)	ExaminIR [SOLE SOURCE EXPLANATION] NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the items from FLIR Systems. The camera the Aerostructures branch currently has is from Indigo Systems, but this vendor and FLIR Systems merged into one company. These two vendors were the only ones that could satisfy the camera technical requirements.  Now that they have joined into a single company there are no other known companies in the marketplace that can meet our technical requirements. The camera has to have the 1024x1024 resolution to detect manufacturing defects and defect/damage propagation in the C/SiC structure resulting from testing. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and 13. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 14, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. ?A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are NOT acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Energy Information Administration (EIA), Office of Integrated Analysis and Forecasting (EI-80), intends to award a sole source contract to IHS Energy of Houston Texas for access to the EDIN Field Database.  The period of performance for this license is January 15, 2008 to January 15, 2009.  The requirement consists of licenses for the current version of the EDIN Field Database, which compiles field level information on hydrocarbon production, reserves reporting, and reservoir characteristics. The database is a critical component of numerous reports required from EIA by law, for example the Annual Energy Outlook and the International Energy Outlook. While there are other sources for domestic oil field information, there is no single source for international field data which is comparable to the EDIN Field Database.  This requirement is composed of a basic package of licenses and support which will form the initial award, with further optional items to be awarded subsequently based on funding availability.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation is available for this requirement. Interested parties may submit a capability statement and pricing information for the requirement within 15 calendar days of the publication of this notice, to be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Procurement in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for the Common Color Multifunction Display (CCMFD), Color Programmable Display Generator (CPDG) and the Enhanced Color Programmable Display Generator (eCPDG) Line Replaceable Units (LRU).  The three LRUs combined make up the Multi-function Display System (MFDS) and will be referenced as such throughout this notice.  The purchase order will include engineering services, hardware, training and technical repair data information in accordance with FAR part 15 regulations, Contracting by Negotiation.  The data information includes the following:  Existing parts lists and physical locations of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE); Level I, II, and III drawings; Acceptance test procedures and specifications; Qualification test procedures; Data associated with the factory Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) used for MFDS and/or related facilities requirements; Assembly and wiring diagrams; Theory of operation for the MFDS; System and Unit Under Test (UUT) test specifications (I/O requirements); Schematics and/or logic diagrams; Component schematics and/or logic diagrams; UUT and component timing diagrams; Parts lists; Parts lists for mating connectors that may not be shown in the LRU/LRM; Component layout drawings/IPBs; Memory and fuse map information for programmable devices (PROMS, PALS, PLAs, FPGAs ASICs, ect.) on compatible electronic media with 309 SMXG software support environment (data for any component); Source code for programs developed to test the MFDS and/or sub- assemblies (LRMs and chassis); LASAR models, structural component models with programmed data and/or hardware modeler; Any/all program files, support files and/or information required to recreate organic test capability; Factory repair process data; Test equipment and/or repair process training; Troubleshooting and/or diagnostic techniques; Data collection, data mining, and/or metrics generation processes; Configuration management process training; Unique facility requirements (power, HVAC, clean room, dark room); SRU and/or Piece part provisioning.  The award will go to Honeywell, Inc., 21640N 12th Ave., Phoenix AZ  85027-2810.  This requirement is considered sole source due to the fact Honeywell, Inc. designed and developed the MFDS and associated test equipment with proprietary software and hardware owned and sold exclusively by Honeywell, Inc.  Since the MFDS was originally developed as a Contractor Life Time Support (CLTS) item, no depot remanufacture capability or field support test equipment was developed.

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and all other interested contractors shall submit a capabilities document which states their abilities on fulfilling this requirement.  5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (paragraph (c)) of the clause reads:  Julie Primbs at (801) 777-0768, facsimile (801) 777-6830, or email julie.primbs@hill.af.mil.

A.	Cultural Resource Assessment

GSA projects may require all or parts of a Cultural Resource Assessment to be conducted for Federal actions to ensure compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and pursuant regulations (36 CFR Part 800).  The Contractor shall identify and evaluate historic properties [see 36CFR Part 800.4] on and adjacent to the project area in consultation with GSA and the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO).  The Contractor shall prepare ?Requests for Determinations of Eligibility? (DOE), a history and archaeology report, and an assessment of effects for historic properties identified which are listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).  The survey area or area of potential effect (APE) for historic properties may include prehistoric and historic districts, sites, buildings, structures, or objects which are adjacent to, abut, or located within the project area.
	
  a.  Study Components
i.	Identification and Evaluation
1.	Historic Resources
Background research.   City, County and State surveys for historic resources shall be consulted in order to locate previously identified resources within the project APE.  Survey forms for any previously identified resources within the APE shall be copied and location of the resources located on the appropriate USGS topographic map.  Files of existing and proposed National Register properties shall be consulted in the City, County or SHPO offices.  A copy of each National Register Nomination Form and National Register Summary Form shall be copied for each listed and proposed National Register property located within the APE.
Field Survey.  A field survey shall be conducted in order to identify and locate all listed and eligible National Register properties (including those within historic districts or multiple resource areas).  State Survey Guidelines shall be followed.
Survey Form.  Appropriate State Survey Forms shall be completed for each previously unevaluated historic resource located within the APE which are 50 years or older.  State Survey Manual guidelines shall be used as the reference document for completing these forms.
Requests for Determinations of Eligibility.  In addition to the survey form, requests for Determinations of Eligibility (DOE) shall be prepared by performing all necessary primary and secondary source research.  DOE documentation shall include appropriate Historic Property Information Forms (HPIF) for each previously unevaluated historic resource.  Unless otherwise specified, the information shall include current 35mm color or black and white photographs of the existing historic resources and condition thereof, copies of historic photographs if available, and a sketch of the existing and original floor plans.  Current exterior and interior photographs of the existing historic resource(s) shall be numbered, labeled, and keyed to a sketch of the existing floor plan.  In addition, date of construction of the original building(s) and any additions which were added shall be noted.  Additions to historic resources shall be clearly marked on a location map showing the original building footprint.  State property information forms shall be used as the reference document for gathering the information.
National Register Evaluation.  Apply the National Register Criteria (36 CFR, Part 63) to each existing historic resource on and facing the site that is not already listed in the NRHP.  Provide GSA with recommendations as to the eligibility or ineligibility of each resource for inclusion in the NRHP individually and/or as part of a historic district, including a justification for recommendation.
For any historic resource recommended as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and for those already included in the NRHP, the Contractor shall identify those elements or characteristics of the resource that do and do not contribute to its eligibility, including a justification for each recommendation.
2.	Archaeological Resources
Conduct a Phase I archaeological survey of the project site, and provide GSA with recommendations concerning the probability that archaeological resources eligible for inclusion in the NRHP exist on the site.  An extensive background literature review shall be conducted to document previously identified archaeological sites and to delineate areas of high site potential within and adjacent to the project area, to develop prehistoric and historic contexts for the survey corridor.  Background research shall include review of relevant documents housed with the SHPO, Office of the State Archaeologist, State Site Files, State Department of Archives and History, and the Surveyor General?s Collections.  The States? preservation plan shall also be consulted.  The study must address the following:	
?	Is it likely that significant historic or prehistoric archaeological sites, if they exist, are preserved there in whole or in part?
?	What significance (research or other) would any such site have?
?	If there is significance, would such a site be eligible for inclusion on the NRHP?
?	Is Phase II archaeological study or site testing needed to clarify the presence/absence and/or significance of archaeological resources on the project site, and if so, why?
?	Provide scope of work for any recommended site testing or Phase II evaluation.
?	If archaeological monitoring is recommended for affected sites, these activities may be required as part of this project phase. 
b.	 Effect Determination
  1.     Historic Resources

The contractor shall determine the likely effects of the undertaking on all identified listed or eligible National Register historic resources.  The contractor shall provide GSA with a determination of effect for each historic resource (no historic properties affected, no adverse effect, or adverse effect).  The determination of effect documentation shall include a discussion of direct and indirect effects to the historic resources, a justification for the determination, alternatives to avoid adverse effects, plans to minimize harm and proposed mitigation, if applicable.

2.   Archaeological Resources

The Contractor shall provide GSA with a determination of effect for each National Register eligible archaeological resource which is likely to exist on the project site.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

GENERAL

DHS has determined that performance of this contract requires that the Contractor, subcontractor(s) vendor(s), etc. (herein known as Contractor), have access to DHS facilities and that the Contractor will adhere to the following:

SUITABILITY DETERMINATION

DHS shall have and exercise full control over granting, denying, withholding or terminating unescorted government facility access for Contractor employees based upon the results of a FBI Fingerprint Check.  No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed unescorted access to a Government facility without a favorable suitability determination by the Security Office.

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION

Contract employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-time and replacement employees) under the contract, needing unescorted building access shall undergo a fingerprint check.  All fingerprint checks will be processed through the Security Office.  Prospective Contractor employees shall submit the following completed forms to the Security Office through the COTR no less than 30 days before the starting date of the contract or 30 days prior to entry on duty of any employees, whether a replacement, addition, sub-contractor employee, or vendor:

1.	Standard Form 85P, ??Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions??

2.	FD Form 258, ??Fingerprint Card?? (2 copies)

3.	Foreign National Relatives or Associates Statement

DHS will provide required forms at the time of award of the contract.  Only complete packages will be accepted by the Security Office.  Specific instructions on submission of packages will be provided upon award of the contract.

DHS will consider only US Citizens and Legal Permanent Residents for employment on this contract.

CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY

If a prospective employee is found to be ineligible for access to Government Facilities the COTR will advise the contractor that the employee shall not be assigned to work under the contract.

The Security Office may require drug screening for probable cause at any time and/or when the contractor independently identifies circumstances where probable cause exists.

DHS reserves the right to deny and/or restrict the facility access of any Contractor employee whose actions are in conflict with the DHS standards of conduct, 5 CFR 2635 and 5CFR 3801, or whom DHS determines to present a risk of compromising sensitive Government information to which he or she would have access under this contract.

The Contractor will report any adverse information coming to their attention concerning contract employees under the contract to DHS Security Office.  Reports based on rumor or innuendo should not be made.  The subsequent termination of employee does not obviate the requirement to submit this report.  The report shall include the employees?? name and social security number, along with the adverse information being reported.

The Security Office must be notified of all terminations/resignations within five days of occurrence.  The Contractor will return any expired DHS issued identification cards and building passes, or those of terminated employees to the COTR.  If an identification card or building pass is not available to be returned, a report must be submitted to the COTR, referencing the pass or card number, name of individual to whom issued, the last known location and disposition of the pass or card.

EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY

The Contractor must agree that each employee working on this contract will have a Social Security Card issued and approved by the Social Security Administration.  The Contractor shall be responsible to the Government for acts and omissions of his own employees and for any Subcontractor(s) and their employees.

In the interest of limiting access to potentially sensitive information and Information Technology (IT) Systems, DHS will consider only US Citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) for employment on this contract.  DHS will not approve LPRs for employment on this contract in any position requiring the LPR to access or assist in the development, operation, management or maintenance of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) IT systems, unless a waiver has been granted by the DHS Chief Information Officer.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

A firm-fixed price order will be made to the lowest price technically acceptable, responsive offeror, whose proposal will meet the Governments?? requirement.

PAYMENT

A purchase order will be issued for the work described in this notice.  NET 30 payment terms will apply to the order, however, payment will not be made until inspection and acceptance of work has been performed by the Government and an acceptable, original invoice has been submitted by the vendor.  An invoice shall not be submitted until all work has been completed and accepted by the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a sole-source purchase order to Bauer Compressors Incorporated, 1328 Azalea Garden Road, Norfolk, VA 23502-1944 for the repair and upgrade of seven (7) Bauer Compressors (model C-D/DV/NAVY).   The upgrades will be accomplished by removing the diesel engine and compressor block and rebuilding each returning them to like new condition.  Once the diesel engine and compressor block are reassembled and corrosion resistant improvement completed, the contractor shall assemble the compressors into assembly model C-D/DV/NAVY-SS configuration.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons:   a). Bauer Compressors is the original equipment manufacturer and is the only company qualified to complete these upgrades.  Additionally, these compressors are the only system that has been tested and designated ?Approved for Navy Use? for these compressors.  b). All of!   the life support systems must successfully complete a rigorous test series including hot and cold temperature exposure tests, shock load tests and shipboard vibration tests.  Use of any other compressors would necessitate extensive, time consuming, and costly recertification for the shock, vibration, and thermal test requirements.  It is estimated that requalifying the life support systems would cost the U.S. Navy hundreds of thousands of dollars and would take several months to complete thus significantly delaying delivery of the life support systems to the fleet. c). The physical size, weight and operating characteristic of the system components are crucial to providing a U. S. Navy certified system.  Since the physical size, weight and orientation of the Bauer Compressors determine the system response to shock loading and vibration, any changes in these characteristics from the design already tested would require additional shock and vibration testing prior to U.S. Navy!   certification of the life support system. d). There is no guarantee t hat other replacement parts will successfully pass the required shock, vibration and temperature testing necessary to certify the life support system for U. S. Navy use. Offerors wishing to qualify for future procurements may find out about the process for qualification by contacting Mr. Gerald Muskaloon, NSWC PC Code S14, (850)-235-5411, Gerald.muskaloon@navy.mil.  Award will be based on the written quotation. When the RFQ is released, it can be reviewed at the following Web Page: http://www.ncsc.navy.mil/Contracts/BusOps/Busops.htm. A firm-fixed-price order is anticipated. Anticipated award date will be on or about 14 Dec, 2007. PSC code is 4220,  NAICS Code 333912 applies. SBA Size Standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source contract to Raytheon Technical Services Company (RTSC), LLC located in Van Nuys, CA for the repair of MDA's extensively modified DC-10 aircraft used for airborne data collection and hosting guest sensors, known as the Widebody Airborne Sensor Platform (WASP).

RTSC's tasks shall include WASP airworthiness modifications (Firm Fixed Price (FFP)), aircraft maintenance activities (FFP), and flight testing and system adjustments to ensure full operating capability (Cost Plus Fixed Fee).  The anticipated award date for this contract is 29 February 2008, to meet the Government need date of 2nd Quarter Fiscal Year 2009.  The estimated contract value is $30M.  The estimated period of performance is 9 months for airworthiness modifications and routine heavy maintenance, and 18 months for flight testing and airworthiness certification, for a total of 27 months.   The contractor shall determine the contract place of performance.

The service is being considered for sole source based upon FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), which states that "Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements."  RTSC is the original modifier of the WASP, and has extensive knowledge and information on the aircraft modifications.  The Government had previously issued a sole source contract to RTSC for a WASP return to service analysis (posted on FedBizOpps on December 22, 2006 http://www.fbo.gov/servlet/Solicitation/R/ODA/MDA/WASHDC1/Reference-Number-HQ0006-07-C-WASP).  Based on the prior work already completed by RTSC, the use of any other contractor for the repair would require substantial duplication of cost and effort to gather comparable knowledge of the plane and its airworthiness issues that is not likely to be offset by competition.

As well, the Government published a Sources Sought Notice on FedBizOpps on October 31, 2007 for the repair and flight testing of the WASP (http://www.fbo.gov/spg/ODA/MDA/WASHDC1/Reference%2DNumber%2DHQ0006%2D07%2DWASP%2DREPAIR/listing.html).  No other businesses responded to the notice.  

Numbered Note 22 Applies.

<DESC>The VA Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System, Biloxi, MS is seeking offerors to secure a site, design, construct and maintain an office building under a long-term lease arrangement in Mobile, Alabama.  This will be a dedicated facility for the Mobile Veterans Center.  It is the Department of Veterans Affairs policy that Vet Centers are strategically sited in the community to maximize veterans' access to readjustment counseling. The guiding principal regarding site locations include that:          The Vet Center is located as to serve the largest number of veterans with the least            possible distances to travel to the Vet Center.          There is access to public transportation. Access to public transportation is a            critical factor, and is included as a site selection criterion.           The distance to other VA facilities and other non-VA organizations (clinics,           agencies, veterans organizations, etc.) is considered.          Any relevant data concerning the specific service needs of the local veteran           population are taken into consideration.             The specific location of a Vet Center in or near a city maximizes accessibility to           the Vet Center on the part of different population subgroups within the eligible           veteran population.            The Vet Center be located in a neighborhood which is experienced as comfortable             by all veterans and family members.     Site should conform to Federal laws and regulations governing Federal leases, site renovations, construction and fire codes.  Vet Centers may also be located at a VA medical facility; i.e., co-located with a VA outpatient clinic, or at a VA medical center.  Regarding co-located Vet Centers, available space at the VA medical facility must be suitable for Vet Center operations in accordance with established VHA criteria.  NOTE:  Any such co-location of a Vet Center after January 1988 must be reported to Congress as a revision of the Vet Center National Plan pursuant to 38 U.S.C. (United States Code) Section 1712A as amended by Public Law 100-322.  Vet Centers are designed to provide a welcoming, non-institutional environment oriented by location, design, and decor to all eligible veterans.  In particular, there is an emphasis on space and design conducive to communication between staff and clients, and among clients.  All space aspects should encourage veterans and family members to feel a sense of belonging and welcome at the Vet Center.  The successful offeror will construct and lease a building to the Department of Veterans Affairs for the Mobile Veterans Center as outlined in Government specifications. Brokers or agents may represent the site owner but any properties or proposal submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the ownership of the site.  Solicitation is expected to be released on or about December 14, 2007.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the government.  Telephone inquires will not be honored. The fax number is 228-523-4324. All requests must include the RFP number, requestors name, address, phone, fax number and email address. Please send all requests to the attention of Albertine Honore'.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 531390 and the size standard in millions of dollars is $2.0.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.

<DESC>THIS IS A MODIFICATION TO THE INITIAL NOTICE POSTED ON NOVEMBER 21, 2007. BY ISSUE OF THIS MODIFICATION, THIS PROCUREMENT IS ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS (FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION).

PROJECT DETAILS:  CFL anticipates awarding up to three Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) for construction services.  

The CFL will be requesting proposals for a MATOC for projects which primarily include improvements to low-volume and low-speed roadways that serve as Primary Missile Defense Access Highways owned and operated by local counties for the benefit of the United States Air Force Space Command. Projects may be located in environmentally sensitive areas that necessitate context-sensitive construction techniques and processes. The predominant geographic area includes north-eastern Colorado, south-western Nebraska, south-eastern Wyoming, and eastern Montana. 

The government anticipates individual task orders ranging from $50,000 to $5,000,000.00.  Potential contractors will be required to demonstrate bonding capacity of up to $5,000,000 per task order with a yearly capacity of up to $10,000,000.  Bonding will only be required for individual task orders.  Request for Task Order Proposals will include Davis Bacon wage determinations and specific plans and specs for the project.  

The first Task Order Request for Proposals (TO-RFP) will be issued simultaneously with the MATOC Request for Proposal.  Contractors will be required to submit a proposal for the first task order as well as the base MATOC RFP.         

Contractor team must be able to demonstrate their ability to mobilize in all of the aforementioned states.  Each contract awarded will consist of one base year and options to extend the contract for four additional one-year periods. The contract will have a maximum not-to-exceed five year total of $35 million. Each contract will operate with individually negotiated task orders issued in accordance with the terms of the contract. Task orders will be predominately for construction activities.

The scope of task orders may include, but are not limited to construction services including mobilization, contractor sampling and testing, roadway pulverization, production and placement of aggregate surface course. 

This is a best value negotiated type procurement and evaluation factors for award are fully stated in the RFP which is available as noted below.  Evaluation factors will include Contract Team and Qualifications including organizational qualifications and key personnel, Contractor Past Performance, Financial capability and bonding capacity, and QA/QC Program and Operations.  The Government may award two or more contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offerors whose offers conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, technical, and other factors considered.     

Tentative advertisement date is on or about JANUARY 15, 2008.  
 
PLEASE NOTE:   The Request for Proposals will be available for download on or about  JANUARY 6, 2007, from the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fedbizopps.gov.   The RFP including plans WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD IN ADOBE (.pdf) FORMAT ONLY ON CFLHD's WEBSITE at http://www.cflhd.gov/procurement/construction/advertised-projects.cfm  under the Project Name.  In order to view the plans, interested vendors must register through the CFL website.  Other information regarding this solicitation is also available at the above website.  If you have problems accessing information on the website, please call (720) 963-3354.

Technical questions specific to the project will only be addressed by FHWA via written correspondence to e-mail address CFLContracts@fhwa.dot.gov or FAX to (720) 963-3360.

A.	Cultural Resource Assessment

GSA projects may require all or parts of a Cultural Resource Assessment to be conducted for Federal actions to ensure compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and pursuant regulations (36 CFR Part 800).  The Contractor shall identify and evaluate historic properties [see 36CFR Part 800.4] on and adjacent to the project area in consultation with GSA and the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO).  The Contractor shall prepare ?Requests for Determinations of Eligibility? (DOE), a history and archaeology report, and an assessment of effects for historic properties identified which are listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).  The survey area or area of potential effect (APE) for historic properties may include prehistoric and historic districts, sites, buildings, structures, or objects which are adjacent to, abut, or located within the project area.
	
  a.  Study Components
i.	Identification and Evaluation
1.	Historic Resources
Background research.   City, County and State surveys for historic resources shall be consulted in order to locate previously identified resources within the project APE.  Survey forms for any previously identified resources within the APE shall be copied and location of the resources located on the appropriate USGS topographic map.  Files of existing and proposed National Register properties shall be consulted in the City, County or SHPO offices.  A copy of each National Register Nomination Form and National Register Summary Form shall be copied for each listed and proposed National Register property located within the APE.
Field Survey.  A field survey shall be conducted in order to identify and locate all listed and eligible National Register properties (including those within historic districts or multiple resource areas).  State Survey Guidelines shall be followed.
Survey Form.  Appropriate State Survey Forms shall be completed for each previously unevaluated historic resource located within the APE which are 50 years or older.  State Survey Manual guidelines shall be used as the reference document for completing these forms.
Requests for Determinations of Eligibility.  In addition to the survey form, requests for Determinations of Eligibility (DOE) shall be prepared by performing all necessary primary and secondary source research.  DOE documentation shall include appropriate Historic Property Information Forms (HPIF) for each previously unevaluated historic resource.  Unless otherwise specified, the information shall include current 35mm color or black and white photographs of the existing historic resources and condition thereof, copies of historic photographs if available, and a sketch of the existing and original floor plans.  Current exterior and interior photographs of the existing historic resource(s) shall be numbered, labeled, and keyed to a sketch of the existing floor plan.  In addition, date of construction of the original building(s) and any additions which were added shall be noted.  Additions to historic resources shall be clearly marked on a location map showing the original building footprint.  State property information forms shall be used as the reference document for gathering the information.
National Register Evaluation.  Apply the National Register Criteria (36 CFR, Part 63) to each existing historic resource on and facing the site that is not already listed in the NRHP.  Provide GSA with recommendations as to the eligibility or ineligibility of each resource for inclusion in the NRHP individually and/or as part of a historic district, including a justification for recommendation.
For any historic resource recommended as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and for those already included in the NRHP, the Contractor shall identify those elements or characteristics of the resource that do and do not contribute to its eligibility, including a justification for each recommendation.
2.	Archaeological Resources
Conduct a Phase I archaeological survey of the project site, and provide GSA with recommendations concerning the probability that archaeological resources eligible for inclusion in the NRHP exist on the site.  An extensive background literature review shall be conducted to document previously identified archaeological sites and to delineate areas of high site potential within and adjacent to the project area, to develop prehistoric and historic contexts for the survey corridor.  Background research shall include review of relevant documents housed with the SHPO, Office of the State Archaeologist, State Site Files, State Department of Archives and History, and the Surveyor General?s Collections.  The States? preservation plan shall also be consulted.  The study must address the following:	
?	Is it likely that significant historic or prehistoric archaeological sites, if they exist, are preserved there in whole or in part?
?	What significance (research or other) would any such site have?
?	If there is significance, would such a site be eligible for inclusion on the NRHP?
?	Is Phase II archaeological study or site testing needed to clarify the presence/absence and/or significance of archaeological resources on the project site, and if so, why?
?	Provide scope of work for any recommended site testing or Phase II evaluation.
?	If archaeological monitoring is recommended for affected sites, these activities may be required as part of this project phase. 
b.	 Effect Determination
  1.     Historic Resources

The contractor shall determine the likely effects of the undertaking on all identified listed or eligible National Register historic resources.  The contractor shall provide GSA with a determination of effect for each historic resource (no historic properties affected, no adverse effect, or adverse effect).  The determination of effect documentation shall include a discussion of direct and indirect effects to the historic resources, a justification for the determination, alternatives to avoid adverse effects, plans to minimize harm and proposed mitigation, if applicable.

2.   Archaeological Resources

The Contractor shall provide GSA with a determination of effect for each National Register eligible archaeological resource which is likely to exist on the project site.  The determination of effect documentation shall include a discussion of direct and indirect effects to the historic resource, a justification for the determination, alternatives to avoid adverse effects, plans to minimize harm, and proposed mitigation, if applicable.

<DESC>Revised posting to the previous FBO posting. A. General Information The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Safety Needles.  The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardize d products be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program. The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB. This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreemen t (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a su pplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is November 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical,  and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become mor e important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, The Government reserves the right to make tw o or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  Point of Contact Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst 808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil B.	Products & Performance Required The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Safety Needles, which at a minimum includes the high volume line items below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $126,120. This forecast is  based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. The top high volume usage lines for this project include are listed in the technical/company criteria. At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types, and packagin g information of the products supplied by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Vendors DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received by 4:0 0 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will result be disqualified from participating.   This process wi ll include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, on-site in-person in-servicing, product literature, education and training materials, and submission of electronic best price q uotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above that their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information  has actually arrived at the Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.   D.	 Evaluation Criteria The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this ini tiative.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain  the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requ irements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit  the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. Phase I: Technical/Company Evaluation Process Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by e-mailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine the acceptabilit y of each vendor. After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject med ical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and  (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. The following Technical/Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: 1.	Vendor must manufa cture and/or distribute a complete product line of Safety Needles. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work  as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, the following items are required:  a.	Safety Needle lengths 1 in 18 gauge through 25 gauge b.	Safety Needle lengths 1 1/2 18 gauge through 25 gauge Provide certification of all brands of this product line that you manufacturer or distribute with the initial submittal. 2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Safety Needles product line. Provided the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show  a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified). 3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the regional prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified).  4.	Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note that vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified). 5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy pricing quotes and competitive product cross-reference in electronic MS Excel format upon request. 6.	Vendor must provide educational tools, product literature, and materials for Safety Needles as well as no cost samples for the evaluation. Describe your available company educational tools and material resources with the initial submittal. 7.	Vendor must provide customer service (telephonic and e-mail) for regional facilities. Identify company resources and capabilities for such support with the initial submittal. 8.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region. Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with the initial submittal. 9.	Vendor is required to provide on-site, in-person in-servicing to Tripler Army Medical Center prior to the clinical evaluation. Vendors, who cannot provide on-site, in-person in-servicing to TAMC, prior to the clinical evaluation, will be disqualified. 10.	Vendor is required to provide product literature, training aids, and teaching materials prior to the clinical evaluation to NH Guam, NH Yokosuka, NH Okinawa, and the US Army Health Clinic Schofield Barracks. Vendors, who cannot provide product literatu re, training aids, and teaching materials to these MTFs, prior to the clinical evaluations, will be disqualified. 11.	Vendors product line must be latex free and indicated on the packaging and in the product literature.  12.	Vendor will provide a product and packaging which clearly displays the size of the device. Phase II: Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process The multi-disciplinary TPRB Clinical Team will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will  be allowed 21 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4:00 p.m. local time, on the (21st ) calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline  will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating. One (1) = strongly disagree, Two (2) = disagree, Three (3) = neutral, Four (4) = agree, and Five (5) = strongly agree. All clinical/performance c riteria are equally weighted.  To determine acceptability, the TPRB Clinical Tea m comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The TPRB Clinical Team intends to conduct the clinical evaluation in a clinical and/or non-clinical The Government reserves th e right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  All vendors will be required to provide an on-site, in-person in-service to Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC), prior to the use of their products. Failure to provide on-site, in-person in-servicing to TAMC will result in exclusion from the standardization  process. The TPRBs support and TAMCs rationale for in-servicing of this product group is in compliance with the Association of Peri Operative Registered Nurses Position Statement The role of the health care industry representative in the perioperative/ invasive procedure setting (AORN Recommended practices and Guidelines, 2007). In-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary. All vendors will be required to provide training materials to Naval Hospital Yokosuka, Naval Hospital Okinawa, Naval Hospital Guam, and US Army Health Clinic Schofield Barracks. These training aides will address the safe and acceptable method of using the device. The training/guidance materials may be in the form of a DVD, product literature or other instructional methods that the vendor believes will assist the clinician. These training items must arrive prior to the clinical evaluation period. Failure to provide training/instructional materials will result in exclusion from the standardization process. The clinical representatives, on the TPRB, from NH Guam, NH Okinawa, NH Yokosuka and US Army Health Clinic Schofield Barracks, opted to exercise this option  for the training and guidance of the clinicians who will use the samples. This option is another method used to support the government's minimum need and is normal and customary. Clinical evaluation process for Tripler Army Medical Center: Each vendor will provide on-site, in-person, in-servicing for a period of one week to TAMC clinical staff. One vendor per week. The TPRB Clinician will coordinate the scheduling and location of t he presentations. This individual will work with the vendors in scheduling the training activities. Day 1: vendor will provide in-servicing to the staff. A presentation reviewing 	the technical aspects of the device, the indications for use of the device, and how to use the device will be addressed. Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted. The vendor will be available for any questions, consultations, or guidance regarding the product. All vendors will be required to meet the standards of conduct in  accordance with facility policies, local, state, and federal regulations. Clinical evaluation process for Naval Hospital Yokosuka, Naval Hospital Okinawa, Naval Hospital Guam, and US Army Health Clinic Schofield Barracks. Each vendor will provide product literature, training aides and teaching material prior to the clinical eval uation. The Pacific Region TPRB clinical representative, from each of these MTFs, will select the appropriate providers for this evaluation. They will proctor and monitor the clinical evaluation process. Day 1: the staff will review all literature and teac hing aides provided by a vendor. Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted. Vendors will be available by telephone for questions, consultations and guidance. The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: 1.	Safety mechanism is easily activated using only one hand.(The mechanism lever or switch or shield can be pushed or pulled or pressed easily by one hand  two hands are not necessary to activate the safety mechanism) 2.	The safety mechanism cannot be activated passively.(The mechanism remains inactivated when holding or grasping or using device to perform a venapuncture) 3.	Once the safety mechanism is activated, no part of the needle is accessible. (The cover or shield covers the entire needle) 4.	Once the safety mechanism is activated, the device cannot be reused. (The cover or shield leaves the device with no ability to uncover the needle and reuse the needle) 5.	Product is compatible with luer-loc and slip tip syringes, regardless of manufacturer. (The hub of the safety needle will connect with a luer-loc and slip tip syringe). Phase III: Pricing Analysis Process After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors who participated in the clinical/performance evaluation will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed vo lume of 80% of the total Regional requirement. Vendors will be provided seven calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email. Price quotes must be received by 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) 7th calendar day. Failure to re spond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), with out discussions as noted above. However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the governme nt and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization  Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more  important than other pricing elements.

<DESC>PURPOSE: The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA 05Z) is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) from all potential sources who may be interested in the development and manufacture of gas turbine engines in the 9 (nine) to 15 (fifteen) Megawatt power range for use on Naval vessels.  These engines should be capable of operating at high output speeds, on the order of 6,500 to 12,000 rpm at full power.  The Navy is currently developing proof of concept hardware for advanced electrical generators and is seeking information on the potential gas turbine prime mover for the electrical generator.  The gas turbine engines may also be used in a mechanical drive application.  The resulting production gas turbine engines will need to be certified to American Bureau of Shipbuilding Naval Vessel Rules (ABS-NVR) and be capable of being in production by 2013. This RFI in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies. The information provided will assist NAVSEA in developing and further defining future procurement and acquisition strategies. Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate. However, respondents must be able to demonstrate that they currently produce engines in the power and speed ranges specified for commercial or other military applications.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) and The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) have a requirement to develop medical therapies and diagnostics to counter radiological and nuclear threats.

Description 

Radiation injury can be caused by external or internal exposure, and the effects of radiation on the body may appear within minutes or develop many years after exposure. Internal exposure occurs when radionuclides are internalized by inhalation, ingestion, or through contaminated wounds and distributed to sensitive tissues.  The primary treatment to minimize internal exposure is the elimination of internal radionuclides through the administration of chelating, decorporating, or blocking agents.  There is a need for the continued development of decorporation agents.

The Offeror will provide the required services including the following: development of an information base and rodent and non-rodent animal models of internal radionuclide contamination, development of rodent and non-rodent screen and efficacy evaluation animal models, and GLP-compliant radionuclide exposure facilities.  The animal models that are to be developed are intended to support future GLP pivotal animal efficacy studies with an eventual goal of supporting licensure of decorporation agents or other treatments of radionuclide internal contamination.

The work to be performed under this contract will be initiated by the NIAID Contracts Office through a mechanism called work assignments.  The Government intends to establish contracts for two facilities to carry out the efforts described above.
Adherence to the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (PHS Policy) is a term and condition of all PHS grant or contract awards that includes use of live, invertebrate animals.  Both OLAW and AAALAC accreditations demonstrate compliance with PHS Policy.  The USDA regulates institutions performing research on warm-blooded species other than rodents and birds and must comply with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations.  Any research facility using radioactive materials in scientific research studies must comply with appropriate federal and state licensing requirements.

It is anticipated that two work assignment type contracts will be awarded for a five (5)-year period of performance beginning on or about September 30, 2008, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 6.35 FTEs. 

Interested small business organizations that have current and potential capabilities in the following areas are invited to submit a capability statement to the NIAID.  Please submit information on existing facilities and descriptions of new facilities and instrumentation or renovations that would be required to support radionuclide studies and GLP compliance.  Facilities needs and requirements include: 

	Radionuclide resources including a range of pertinent radionuclides and physicochemical forms 

	Facilities for storage and disposal of radionuclides and contaminated waste 

	Animal facilities for rodents, canines, and non-human primates and for housing and care of radionuclide contaminated animals 

	Laboratories for all analyses and radionuclide measurements 

	Instrumentation and equipment for laboratory, animal tissue, and radionuclide  measurements 

	Laboratories for radionuclide administration by inhalation, ingestion, injection and transdermal (wound) routes 

	Support infrastructure for GLP compliance, radiation safety, security, monitoring 

	Licenses and accreditations 

	Staff trained and experienced in projected studies. 
Capability statements submitted as a result of this announcement should demonstrate the offerors? qualifications and experience, specifically providing evidence as to their capability to perform this requirement, with particular attention to the following:

	Efficacy evaluation of radionuclide decorporation agents in animal models predictive of human responses 

	Optimization studies for candidate decorporation agents (route of administration, dose, schedule of administration) 

	Pivotal GLP studies under the FDA Animal Efficacy Rule (21 CFR part 314 subpart I and 21 CFR 601 subpart H) 

	Radionuclide pharmacokinetic, biodistribution and pathophysiology studies by various routes of administration and physicochemical forms of radionuclides 

	Safety pharmacology studies in animal models; and 

	GLP Toxicology and PK/ADME studies in various animal models 

	Personnel/Management: adequacy, appropriateness and relevance of expertise, experience, qualifications, and availability of the key professional and technical staff with a project of similar size, scope, and complexity.  

	Past Performance:  Past performance is considered essential. In addition to demonstrating that they have met the above qualifications, interested parties must identify at least three other projects of similar size and complexity.

All capable small business organizations are encouraged to submit capability statements based on this announcement. Organizations that responded to the Request for Information published on March 22, 2007 (RFI NOT-AI-07-028) need not submit a capability statement.  

Interested organizations should submit two copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above.  Please limit responses to 5 pages.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  Written capability statements should be received by the Contracting Officer by December 14, 2007. Please reference the solicitation number on all related correspondence.  No collect calls will be accepted. Facsimile and e-mail transmissions will be accepted.  Any proprietary information should be so marked (see Government-Wide Numbered Note 26).

<DESC>A. General Information The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Safety Needles.  The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardize d products be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program. The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB. This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreemen t (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a su pplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is November 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical,  and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become mor e important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, The Government reserves the right to make tw o or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  Point of Contact Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst 808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil B.	Products & Performance Required The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Safety Needles, which at a minimum includes the high volume line items below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $126,120. This forecast is  based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. The top high volume usage lines for this project include are listed in the technical/company criteria. At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types, and packagin g information of the products supplied by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Vendors DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received by 4:0 0 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will result be disqualified from participating.   This process will include vendor requirements to provide electr onic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, on-site in-person in-servicing, product literature, education and training materials, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost  in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above that their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Regional Tri-Servic e Business Office (TRBO) via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.   D.	 Evaluation Criteria The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this ini tiative.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain  the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requ irements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit  the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. Phase I: Technical/Company Evaluation Process Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by e-mailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine the acceptabilit y of each vendor. After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject med ical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and  (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct.

Vendors product line must be latex free and indicated on the packaging and in the product literature.  12.	Vendor will provide a product and packaging which clearly displays the size of the device. Phase II: Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process The multi-disciplinary TPRB Clinical Team will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will  be allowed 21 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4:00 p.m. local time, on the (21st ) calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline  will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating. One (1) = strongly disagree, Two (2) = disagree, Three (3) = neutral, Four (4) = agree, and Five (5) = strongly agree. All clinical/performance c riteria are equally weighted.  To determine acceptability, the TPRB Clinical Team comprised of medica l professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The TPRB Clinical Team intends to conduct the clinical evaluation in a clinical and/or non-clinical The Government reserves the right to conduct ev aluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  All vendors will be required to provide an on-site, in-person in-service to Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC), prior to the use of their products. Failure to provide on-site, in-person in-servicing to TAMC will result in exclusion from the standardization  process. The TPRBs support and TAMCs rationale for in-servicing of this product group is in compliance with the Association of Peri Operative Registered Nurses Position Statement The role of the health care industry representative in the perioperative/ invasive procedure setting (AORN Recommended practices and Guidelines, 2007). In-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary. All vendors will be required to provide training materials to Naval Hospital Yokosuka, Naval Hospital Okinawa, Naval Hospital Guam, 18th MDG Kadena, Naval Health Clinic Hawaii, and the 121 CSH. These training aides will address the safe and acceptable meth od of using the device. The training/guidance materials may be in the form of a DVD, product literature or other instructional methods that the vendor believes will assist the clinician. These training items must arrive prior to the clinical evaluation per iod. Failure to provide training/instructional materials will result in exclusion from the standardization process. The clinical representatives, on the TPRB, from NH Guam, NH Okinawa, NH Yokosuka and 36th MDG Andersen, opted to exercise this option for th e training and guidance of the clinicians who will use the samples. This option is another method used to support the government's minimum need and is normal and customary. Clinical evaluation process for Tripler Army Medical Center: Each vendor will provide on-site, in-person, in-servicing for a period of one week to TAMC clinical staff. One vendor per week. The TPRB Clinician will coordinate the scheduling and location of t he presentations. This individual will work with the vendors in scheduling the training activities. Day 1: vendor will provide in-servicing to the staff. A presentation reviewing 	the technical aspects of the device, the indications for use of the device, and how to use the device will be addressed. Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted. The vendor will be available for any questions, consultations, or guidance regarding the product. All vendors will be required to meet the standards of conduct in  accordance with facility policies, local, state, and federal regulations. Clinical evaluation process for Naval Hospital Yokosuka, Naval Hospital Okinawa, Naval Hospital Guam, 18th MDG Kadena, Naval Health Clinic Hawaii, and the 121 CSH. Each vendor will provide product literature, training aides and teaching material prior to t he clinical evaluation. The Pacific Region TPRB clinical representative, from each of these MTFs, will select the appropriate providers for this evaluation. They will proctor and monitor the clinical evaluation process. Day 1: the staff will review all lit erature and teaching aides provided by a vendor. Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted. Vendors will be available by telephone for questions, consultations and guidance. The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: 1.	Safety mechanism is easily activated using only one hand.(The mechanism lever or switch or shield can be pushed or pulled or pressed easily by one hand  two hands are not necessary to activate the safety mechanism) 2.	The safety mechanism cannot be activated passively.(The mechanism remains inactivated when holding or grasping or using device to perform a venapuncture) 3.	Once the safety mechanism is activated, no part of the needle is accessible. (The cover or shield covers the entire needle) 4.	Once the safety mechanism is activated, the device cannot be reused. (The cover or shield leaves the device with no ability to uncover the needle and reuse the needle) 5.	Product is compatible with luer-loc and slip tip syringes, regardless of manufacturer. (The hub of the safety needle will connect with a luer-loc and slip tip syringe). Phase III: Pricing Analysis Process After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors who participated in the clinical/performance evaluation will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed vo lume of 80% of the total Regional requirement. Vendors will be provided seven calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email. Price quotes must be received by 4:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST) 7th calendar day. Failure to re spond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), with out discussions as noted above. However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the governme nt and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization  Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more  important than other pricing elements.

<SUBJECT>D--JOINT DOD-VA INPATIENT EHR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION **The results of this RFI are NOT intended to result in the issuance of an RFP or RFQ. **
<SOLNBR>W81XWH-08-RFI-EHR
<RESPDATE>121307
<ARCHDATE>02112008
<CONTACT>Barry Sayer, 301-619-1163
<DESC>**The results of this RFI are NOT intended to result in the issuance of an RFP or RFQ. ** Introduction: USAMRAA on behalf of the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs has developed this Request for Information (RFI) to support their efforts to jointly acquire and implement an inpatient Electronic Health Record (EHR).  This RFI is inten ded to solicit information from industry to support the analysis for this project.  The desired outcome of this RFI is strategic thought leadership on potential solutions that may enable the DOD and VA to realize the goal of a Joint Inpatient EHR.   The Government does not desire to receive individual corporate marketing materials or slick sheets.  The Government will not review marketing materials and slick sheets.  Please see submission procedures listed at the end of this notice.  Contractors suppo rting the DOD/VA team will review materials submitted in response to this RFI.  Booz Allen Hamilton and Gartner Inc. are currently supporting the Government with this project.  Additionally, the respondents agree that any material submitted in response to this RFI maybe used in part or in whole by the Government as required to support the joint DOD/VA Inpatient EHR project. Background: Independently both the VA and the DOD operate two of the largest healthcare systems in the world.  When considering an inpatient EHR solution for both the DOD and the VA the magnitude and complexity of the system is magnified.  In developing a response to this RFI, each respondent must consider the volume and complexity of these organizations.  Failure to adequately address the volume and complexity may render a proposed solution to be considered not viable by the Government.  For more information on each o rganization, please reference their organization websites, http://www1.va.gov/opa/fact/vafacts.asp and http://www.tricare.mil/pressroom/press_facts.aspx.   The DOD and VA have made significant progress over the last decade in the implementation of robust, comprehensive EHR Systems. In contrast to most private sector provider organizations, DOD and VA were early adopters of the EHR System (EHR-S) and are argua bly among the most advanced users of EHR Systems in the nation. Both DOD and VA have large beneficiary populations which, taken together, span the continuum from young, healthy active duty service members and their families, to elderly veterans receiving d omiciliary care. As such, the focus of each organizations EHR-S has been different. These systems, which serve active duty service members and veterans, are currently exchanging electronic health care information through applications such as the Federal H ealth Information Exchange (FHIE), the Bi-directional Health Information Exchange (BHIE), and Clinical Data Repository/Health Data Repository (CHDR). However, even though the DOD and VA currently operate the largest health information exchange in the natio n, both agencies realize that the overarching challenge, as yet unmet, is to provide seamless, comprehensive information interoperability during this time of war to further support the Wounded Warrior.  The overall goal of the Joint DOD/VA Inpatient EHR project is to determine the feasibility of conducting a joint systems acquisition strategy for a new common inpatient EHR system as agreed to by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defen se. The Government is assessing the current and projected inpatient EHR clinical and business applications as well as the functional and technical requirements that may be relevant to a potential joint application. Specifically, the study will assess VAs and DODs business and clinical processes, design features and system constraints relevant to the inpatient component of an electronic health record.  In addition to determining the feasibility of conducting a joint systems acquisition strategy for a commo n inpatient EHR, other principle initiatives include an assessment of  potential costs, schedule, and risks to implement Department-unique and joint requirements, as well as recommended follow-on activities and proposed next steps for the Government to take in pursuit of a common inpatient EHR. Recently a working group of DOD and VA subject matter experts, in conjunction with notable industry experts developed the following set of joint Inpatient EHR Capabilities (See attachments listed below for more details): Core Capabilities:  Manage Orders, Provide Automated Clinical Decision Support, Manage Clinical Tasks and Processes, Provide Knowledge Resources, Manage Patient Reported Data, Manage Results, Manage Documentation Subscribing Capabilities: Manage Coding and Billing, Support Performance Management, Support Continuous Quality Improvement, Support Risk Management, Support Clinical Research, Support Population Reporting, Support Case Management, Support Case Management,  Support Disease Management Cooperating Capabilities:  Manage Ancillary Services, Support Utilization Management, Manage Scheduling and Resource Allocation, Manage Admission, Discharge and Transfer Additional background information can be obtained by contacting the Government POC listed at the end of this notice.  If requested the following additional information will be provided: "	EHR Capability Reference Model "	List of Definitions "	Definition of Core, Cooperating, and Subscribing Capabilities Strategic Questions: The Governments desires that respondents offer their experience and recommendations on the following strategic questions: 1.	TECHNICAL SOLUTION:  a.	What type(s) of solutions should the DOD and VA consider (new custom designed system, new COTS implementation, mixed solution, expansion of VISTA or AHLTA, etc&)?  b.	Which type of solution is most likely to result in a successful joint inpatient EHR and why? (Specifically describe how this solution will support each of the capabilities.) How is this a best of breed solution? c.	Provide a high-level overview of the proposed solution from a functional, technical, and clinical perspective.  Be sure to consider the entire system lifecycle. d.	How will the proposed solution leverage, integrate with or replace the current systems?  What are some of the key issues to consider when integrating of replacing current systems? e.	How would the proposed solution interoperate with providers outside of the DoD and VA?  2.	BENEFITS:  What are the functional, clinical and technical benefits (both qualitative and quantitative) of the recommended solution relative to the other solutions? 3.	TIMELINE:  What is a feasible and realistic implementation timeline for the recommended solution?  Specifically, outline the initial deployment timelines and when would it be fully deployed? 4.	COST DRIVERS:  To the degree practicable, please discuss the costs drivers and components associated with the proposed solution?  How do these costs compare to other potential solutions?  Be sure to consider costs across the entire system lifecycle. 5.	RISKS:  What are the most significant risks involved with the recommended solution? How do these risks compare to other alternatives? How will the risks for the proposed solution be mitigated? 6.	GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND MANAGEMENT APPROACH: What type of governance model and organizational structure would you recommend for this effort?  Consider technical and non-technical aspects and provide examples of comparable joint management efforts.   7.	ACQUISITION STRATEGY: What type of acquisition strategy would you recommend for this type of solution? Include pricing strategies in your response.  Please consider the pros and cons of alternative deployment approaches.  What is the best of breed appro ach? 8.	LESSONS LEARNED:  What lessons learned would you offer to the DOD and VA as they consider planning and implementation of an inpatient EHR solution?  Please note how workflow and integration issues were addressed in projects of similar com plexity.  Please identify areas where quick wins can be achieved and areas that will be most difficult.   9.	INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND COMPLIANCE:  Describe how the proposed solution will comply and remain compliant with current federal policies and industry standards.  If the solution will not be based on industry standards, please explain. Submission Procedures: Please follow the following steps when submitting a response to this RFI: 1)  Contact Ms. Stacy Lear at Stacy.Lear@tma.osd.mil to receive the Executive Summary submission template and the additional background information. 2)  Develop RFI response that does not exceed 30 single sided pages.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Purchase of Luminex 200 Instrument/Cytometer, STarBundle Software, FDA Approved Software, and Installation
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Applied Cytometry Systems, Inc., 777 Campus Commons Road, Sacramento, CA 95825-8343, for a Luminex 200 system, which includes a Luminex 200 cytometer, Luminex XYP plate handler, Luminex high-throughput Sheath Delivery system; StarBundle advanced software package with Control License Version 2.3 for Acquisition and Analysis, Worklist editor for post-acquisition data editing, and StarCollate software for data collation with 1-year warranty and software with FDA approval; on-site installation and training with lifetime support; and calibration microspheres and 20L Sheath Fluid. This unit and software gives the laboratory the ability to adjust gates (bead regions/singlet gate) during acquisition or later. During post-acquisition analysis it is possible to re-adjust gates and re-analyze the data. This keeps the beads from shifting and not being counted. The software allows for multi-user log-in and ability to assign different security levels to different users. It customizes software according to individual user preferences for plate layout, acquisition, curve fitting and reporting, and provides automatic data reduction (post acquisition). Reports and standard curves are generated automatically, providing results in a specified unit. It handles dilutions and calculates concentrations. It gives the ability to exclude individual standards or unknown samples. It has automatic error detection and flagging during acquisition. It allows for post-acquisition editing of the standard concentrations and re-analysis. It can collate multiple plates to one standard curve. The software is also required to be compatible with other data and programs already in use by the laboratory. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

Title:	Side Facing Gunners Seats (Mobile Aircrew Crashworthy Seating Systems for Helicopters)

Research & Technical Areas: Human Systems

Government Program POC:	MAJ Matt Jury, PM-TAPO, Ft Eustis, VA 23692, Phone: (757) 878-0730, ext. 261.   Fax: 757-878-0728.  Email: Matt.Jury@us.army.mil

Objective:  Develop innovative technologies that can be incorporated into a lightweight, crashworthy, and movable helicopter seating system for aircrew that require mobility during flight to perform their duties.  The Proposed Seating System shall be compatible with the crew duties of; 1) Airspace Surveillance, 2) Target detection and Recognition, 3) Weapons manning and operation and 4)  Aircraft mission tasks of internal cargo and passenger  transport in threat areas which requires rapid ingress/egress of the aircraft.

Description:	Helicopter Side Facing Gunners Seat (SFGS) Program is intended to provide a Seating System that complements the mission needs of aircraft crewmembers in the cabin of the MH-47 aircraft.  These personnel (e.g. gunners, flight engineers, crew chiefs) are considered as mobile aircrew members.  They are located in the aircraft cabin and require mobility to give them flexibility to perform their mission duties while still being provided with adequate protection in the event of a severe maneuver, crash, or other impact event. These duties often involve reaching outside the aircraft while providing ground suppression fire using an M134 Minigun or M240 Machine Gun, scanning for survivors, operating a rescue hoist, providing medical care, scanning for threats to the aircraft or conducting other assigned duties. The Current crew cabin seating systems are either non-existent or installed in an Aft Facing orientation which does meet mission requirements.  The existing system (Forward Aft Facing seat) does not meet mission requirements and cannot be easily be moved or removed during flight or it limits crewmember full range of motion which hinders them with their duties during scanning and weapons systems operation as well as troop transport, and cargo loading/unloading. The Aft Cabin crew stations currently do not have any type of seating system which results in limited or no impact protection.   

A crashworthy, light-weight, and movable/stowable seating prototype is required that allows the cabin crewmembers the freedom to perform the majority of his airborne tasks from the seat but also allows for easy and rapid repositioning or stowing of the seat to accommodate cargo/troop ingress/egress, hoist operations, etc. The prototype will also allow the crewmember quick transition to a standing position. The seating system should provide adequate crew protection and restraint during a crash pulse at least equivalent to the flight crew seats. The seating system also needs to accommodate the entire aircrew population while wearing all the necessary crew equipment (5-95th percentile personnel with body armor, life vest, helmet, etc). To achieve acceptable seating system performance levels for the varied duties, the solution should address crew anthropometry, ergonomics, restraint systems, equipment design, workload, human-seating interface issues, Human Systems Integration (HSI) and crash protection strategies. 

The Side Facing Gunners Seat Program focuses solely on the mobile aircrew seating systems. Mobile crewmembers need to be just that mobile, in order to perform their current duties (frequently and rapidly be able to get in and out of the seats), whereas troops need to be able to quickly get into their seats, strap in, and stay there until they reach their destination, and then be able to quickly leave their seats and egress the aircraft. The mobile crewmember work areas are located in the forward aircraft door and window areas (Fuselage Station 140) and adjacent to the Aft Cabin Gunners stations areas at Fuselage Station 430.  The Forward Door and aft cabin stations are in the primary aircraft ingress and egress routes which requires that the seats need to be able to be easily and quickly moved out of the way for ingress/egress, hoist operations, troop insertions (combat assaults), etc., whereas the troop seats are not blocking doors and only need to be moved/repositioned during mission changeovers such as going from troop transport to cargo transport. The mobile crew seats need to accommodate one individual at each position. The SFGS must be compatible with the mobile crewmembers Air Warrior system of life support equipment and ballistic protection ensemble.   

The Project Manager for Technology Application Programs, MH-47 Project Management Office in concert with the Systems Integration and Maintenance Office (SIMO), 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) (SOAR(A)) anticipates hosting an Open House Workshop on 15 and 16 Jan 2008 at Fort Campbell, KY that will provide additional information and address issues related to the SFGS Program.  This Open House Workshop is open to prospective bidders on this topic, but the attendees must be US Citizens or permanent residents. The briefing information will also be available to prospective bidders who are not able to attend the Workshop. For additional information, please check for updates on the FEDBIZOPS website or contact the Contracting or Project Officer.
  	PHASE I: Develop lightweight and mobile seating system concepts to provide maximum protection to the aircrew by attenuating crash energy by adequately restraining the crewmembers, yet provide adequate mobility to allow crewmembers to perform a majority of their airborne duties from the seated position.
  	PHASE II: Validate the solution(s) identified in Phase I to include modeling, testing, prototypes, and initial operational assessment to ensure aircrew equipment/aircraft compatibility. Demonstrate the crashworthy aspects of the system. Identify aircraft structural requirements and potential modifications necessary to accommodate the system.
  	PHASE III:  Down select of the design which provides the most benefit to the Government based on Source Selection Criteria and User Evaluation feedback.  The USER Evaluation comments on seat usefulness shall be weighted heavily in this effort.

<SUBJECT>--Emerging Technology Augmented Reality Pilot
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: Participation in Emerging Technology Augmented Reality Pilot.  This is a Request for Information in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations 15.201.  The US Army Contracting Agency, Contracting Center of Excellence (CC E) at the Pentagon, on behalf of Department of Defense Chief Information Office (DoD CIO). Responses to this RFI shall be submitted via e-mail to Jackie.Moore@hqda.army.mil or Donald.Leath@hqda.army.mil no later than 2:00 P.M. EST, December 14, 2007.  Please limit each submission to 20 pages, excluding cover and content pages. Inquiries: Questions shall be submitted via e-mail to Jackie.Moore@hqda.army.mil or Donald.Leath@hqda.army.mil no later than 3:00 P.M. EST, December 5, 2007. DESCRIPTION:  The Department of Defense makes significant investments in a number of different information technology systems.  Often when conducting a review of the most appropriate technology, emerging technologies are considered.  By definition, an emer ging technology is one who's science, basic principles, and theory are understood, and at least some useful applications are recognized; one that made the challenging journey from promising idea to indispensable invention.  Unfortunately, it is often diffi cult to gather information about the various emerging technologies that can best satisfy a capability need.    It is essential that program offices, requirements personnel and technologists have an awareness of the latest emerging technologies when conduct ing their analysis of alternatives tasks. PURPOSE:  The DoD CIO is conducting an emerging technology pilot focused on Augmented Reality research and technologies.  The purpose is to bring together emerging technology vendors and researchers with potential DoD buyers by providing an environment tha t enables potential future buyers to discover ongoing research and development in emerging technologies.  This pilot project is intended to provide insight to a systemic solution to the research required to discover emerging technology. It is anticipated t hat a subset of the DoD requirements and acquisition community interested in future requirements and programmatic decisions potentially involving augmented reality technology will be viewing the content. SCOPE:  While a full net-centric technology taxonomy is provided, for the duration of the Pilot (60 days), the only net-centric technology fully detailed will be the Augmented Reality area. For the purposes of this project, emerging technology solutions ar e categorized as still developing devices, standards, applications, software and services which can aid in implementing net-centric operations.  At the point of sale, emerging technologies cease to be considered emerging and are instead looked at as COTS p roducts.  However, refinements under development for existing COTS products can be considered emerging technology. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PARTICIPATION:  The DoD CIO Emerging Technology Pilot is located at http://www.emergingtechnet.com.  Interested Augmented Reality researchers and vendors should go to this site and then click on the Industry and Researcher Participation  page.  This page has instructions for registering on the site, and for filling out a vendor/researcher overview page and descriptions of your research and products.  Additionally, you may update the Augmented Reality page as appropriate.  All told, it is  anticipated that participation in the pilot will take well less than an hours time. NOTE:  This information is for market research only.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), or solicitation or an indication that the government will contract for this requirement.  The government will not pay for information received in response to th is RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received. SUMMARY:  The DoD CIO appreciates your assistance with this emerging technology pilot and emphasizes that this effort is for pilot purposes only.  Responses and partici pation will not be treated as proposals, but may be used to aid in the development of a fully operational emerging technology discovery system.  Respondents should ensure that no proprietary information is submitted in response to this RFI.

Recycled-content products are identified in the Environmental Protection Agency?s Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPGs).  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be producing a similar list which designates Bio-based products.  EPA guideline items (and USDA designated bio-based products, when designated) are seen as the minimum that should be considered when evaluating environmentally preferable materials.  Other environmentally preferable materials and products not listed, but commonly used in industry outside of the Government, should also be considered.  
The recently issued Executive Order 13423 (January 24, 2007) requires federal agencies to use sustainable environmental practices, including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products.  Moreover, it now requires that paper of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content must be acquired or used in Agency acquisitions of goods and services.

?	All paper utilized in the performance of this contract must be of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content.
?	The contractor, by responding to this RFP/RFQ, affirmatively acknowledges that they will, to the maximum extent practicable, use sustainable environmental practices including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products in the performance of this contract that meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items, which are found at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm.   In addition, by responding to this RFQ/RFP the contractor is certifying the deliverables required under this contract shall meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items.   
? 2  	Notice of Green alternatives in Offerors? product/service.
(a)	When offering a product or service that contains Green components as that term is defined at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm, the contractor shall make the Contracting Officer aware of such facts in the submission of their quote or proposal.  
(b)	The contractor, when appropriate, shall comply with FAR Clause 52.223-9 Estimate of Percentage of Recovered Material Content for EPA Designated Products.
(c)	? 2  	Affirmative Duty of Contractors to adhere to Green Contracting Policy.  
(a)	Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to examine its packaging to eliminate or reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable material for non-recyclable material in packaging.
(b)  	Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to find other materials utilized in the delivery of services under this contract and examine whether it can reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable materials for non-recyclable materials of items consumed in the furnishing of their services.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION NOTICE.   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format of FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    

The reference number NHLBI-PB(HL)-2008-032-DDC. 

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

This requirement is being conducted as a full and open competitive, with no set aside restrictions. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 334516 and the associated small business size is 500 employees.

The Government?s estimated expected delivery date is sixty calendar days after receipt of the purchase order.

This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-20.  The total contracted dollar amount, including options will not exceed $5 million.  

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions OA, DERA intends intend to award a single, fixed priced purchase order for the purchase of a Liquid Chromatography System for Protein Purification, medical equipment as outlined below.  

The specifications of Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography System for Protein Purification 
are as follows: 

The Government requires the ability to purify biomolecules from complex starting materials derived from cell lysates, tissue homogenates, recombinant protein expression systems and other sources.  The desire system required must be able to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge, hydrophobicity, while retaining biological activity. In addition, upstream separation of proteins is very important in downstream proteomic screening of proteins especially with low copy number proteins and post-transiational modifications (PTMS) of proteins due to dynamic range limitation in complex proteomes.  		
The Government requires a Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) system with a flow rate range of 0.001-10ml/min at pressures ranging from 0-3600 psi.  The system must have an option of adding alternate pump heads to increase flow rate range to 0.01-1ml/min and 1450 psi pressure if needed.  This system needs to have a column screening tool that allows the government to optimize the separation protocol using various separation mechanism for a particular biological system such as mammalian mitochondria. 

Since the Government requires resolution that may necessitate the use of very precise, shallow gradients, the system must be a two-pump gradient system, with dynamic mixing, as evidence suggests that this configuration produces the highest accuracy and precision in gradient formation.

The Government intends to use salt buffers,  with ion exchange chromatography, and the entire wetted flow path of the system must be inert to halides. The pumps heads must be titanium with valves and tubing PEEK. The system pumps should allow operation of the system at zero backpressure to ensure system compatibility with standard low pressure chromatography supports often used in affinity chromatography and other techniques.


This system should include a fraction collector that is fully integrated into the system and controllable via the system control software. The fraction collector must have a stationary collection head that insures when collection at very low rates drop will not be knocked off.  This feature allows the fraction collector to do drop synchronization into collection positions without any sample loss. At high flow rates the faction collector must have an accumulator to prevent sample loss during the time it takes to move to the next collection vessel.  This fraction collector must have the capacity to fractionate into 96-well microplates, 12mm, 18mm, 30mm, 250ml bottles or even larger vessels with prep rack.  The collector must allow the software program to be time-based, volume-based, or column-volume based and must allow user intervention of a running method (e.g., change of a flow rate) without stopping or pausing the run.  This allows the user to overcome unforeseen problems without sacrificing or compromising the sample purification.


The system controller must allow the user to be entering details of the next purification at the same time the current separation is being done, or to simultaneously be integrating and evaluating the results of earlier runs. 

 The pumps, UV and conductivity monitors, valves and fraction collectors must all be specified for use in a cold room at 4 degrees C.

The controller must accept various input signals (e.g., UV wavelengths, conductivity, pH temperatures, pressure, etc.,).  It must be capable of plotting and integrating these signals as well as using them to trigger sub-routines in the programming when the signal exceeds a preset threshold, to allow the automation of multi-dimensional separations.  

The system must also include one automatic three-position injection valve (load, inject, and wash positions), which will allow for sample loading onto the column. 

The system controller should allow for automation of the optimization of separation parameters (e.g., sample volume, flow rates, gradient slope).  This should allow a small amount of the sample to be consumed in optimizing the purification scheme, after which the best regime can be scaled up on the same LC system.
 
Documentation of each run should be automatic and exhaustive, so that for purpose of subsequent replication and eventual publication, no detail is left unrecorded.  

Post-run chromatographic analysis and reporting functions should also be included.

In order to protect the columns, the system must have a definable pressure limit system, which will stop the pump and generate an audible and visual warning, in event pressure exceeds the preset limit.  The government also requires that the controller allow the user the option of including in his/her chromatographic methods programs, commands which will automatically reduce the flow rate if over-pressurization occurs as sample is being applied or eluted form the column. Additional variables which should also be programmable to trigger subroutines (e.g., a new tube on fraction collector, valve changes, etc.) should include UV or conductivity signals.

Installation and training must be provided by the vendor, at no additional cost, quantity one (1) each, inside delivery which includes the installation of equipment, of equipment, removal of ALL debris.

The provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items is applicable to this acquisition. 

The provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items are applicable to this acquisition.  The purchase order award will be made to the Offeror whose product meets the Government?s minimum performance specifications, functional specifications, and delivery date.  A best buy analysis will be performed taking into consideration price, shipping points, technical specifications, special features, probable life of the item selected as compared with that of a comparable item, warranty  considerations, maintenance availability, environmental and energy efficiency considerations, delivery terms, and past performance.  In addition to a price quote, the Offeror must submit descriptive literature of the product proposed, a commercial price list, warranty provisions, and any other information the Offeror considers relevant to the Government?s evaluation of the product proposed.  The Government intends to evaluate the quotes and award the purchase order without discussion with Offerors.  Therefore, the initial offer should contain the Offerors best terms for a technical and price standpoint.    However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, request product samples or demonstrations, if later determined by the Contracting Offeror to be necessary.  The Government may reject any and all offers if such action is deemed necessary.  The Government may also waive informalities and minor irregularities in the offers received.

The Offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer.
