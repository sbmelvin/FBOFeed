<SUBJECT>K--SOFIA UPPER RIGID DOOR INSULATION PANELS
<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement for the fabrication of the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) Upper Rigid Door (URD) Main Insulation Panel Assemblies.  The SOFIA program consists of an airborne observatory platform (a Boeing 747-SP aircraft) equipped with a 2.5 meter infrared telescope, and multiple subsystems to support the telescope and other scientific instruments capable of infrared and sub millimeter observations. The SOFIA observatory is being developed by NASA and its partner the DLR (German Aerospace Center). The SOFIA observatory will be the world?s largest and most sensitive airborne observatory. The aircraft will operate at a ceiling of 45,000 feet. The telescope will look out of an open cavity in the side of the aircraft and allow astronomers to obtain sharper infrared images than ever before for a planned operational life of 20 years.  The open cavity in the side of the aircraft is enclosed by the URD and a Lower Flexible Door (LFD). The work required under this contract is the fabrication of the SOFIA URD Main Insulation Panel Assemblies. The work will be accomplished at the Contractor?s facility. The Contractor shall furnish all necessary materials (unless otherwise specified in this contract) as well as management, labor, administration, operations, technical, safety and quality personnel, and services to accomplish this effort.
