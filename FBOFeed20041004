<DESC>1.0	SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION, PURPOSE, AND SCOPE 

The Program Support Center intends to enter into a sole-source contract under the authority of Part 13.5 to GEMTEH, located in Potomac Maryland.  This Award is necessary to allow the completion of work started under a competitive GSA award and allow time for a large scale full and open competition for support to be solicited.

The Human Resources Service (HRS) of the Program Support Center in the Department of Health and Human Services provides Personnel and Payroll services to all HHS employees nationwide including the Commissioned Corps.   HRS is responsible for the collection, editing, maintenance, storage, and dissemination of personnel and payroll data for the 65,000 HHS employees.  The Integrated Time and Attendance System (ITAS) provides information to the payroll process and HRS requires continuous Database Administration and application support for this system.  

As directed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), HHS is in the process of converting to a new payroll provider, Defense Accounting and Finance System (DFAS).  As part of the payroll conversion, software modifications are required to the ITAS system.  Based on a meeting held with OMB, OPM, DFAS and HHS in September 2004, the payroll conversion date was extended through January 2005.  This decision was based on added requirements and a need to fully test all components/support systems. Contractor support will be required beyond the revised proposed DFAS conversion date to ensure smooth transition to the new provider.

GEMTEH is the contractor currently providing technical support for the ITAS system.  They are responsible for modifying and testing the ITAS software changes required supporting the DFAS payroll conversion project.  PSC/HRS currently has a contract with GSA for the GEMTEH ITAS support, but the last option period ends September 30, 2004 and GSA will not extend the contract.    GEMTEH has provided excellent support in working with PSC personnel in maintaining the ITAS system.  In order to continue to meet the DFAS payroll conversion goals, it is necessary to have the on-going support of the GEMTEH consultants who are knowledge of the enhancements to the ITAS system.  GEMTEH’s past performance has allowed PSC to meet project milestones in a timely manner with quality services.  The GEMTEH staff that is currently providing support to the ITAS system is available to continue work on the project.  This continuity of personnel will eliminate the start-up time and learning curve required for new personnel.  It also eliminates the cost associated with start-up tasks.  Selecting another contractor to perform the services would impact the DFAS payroll conversion date.  

HRS is requesting a sole source contract be awarded to GEMTEH to continue ITAS support for the period of October 1, 2004 through March 31, 2005.  To ensure smooth transition to the new payroll provider, DFAS, contractor support will be required beyond the revised proposed DFAS conversion date.  HRS plans to submit an RFP for competitive bid to provide ITAS support for the period starting in April 2005.

Over the last few years, WAA has begun an agency-wide capacity building initiative, with emphasis on staff development.   Understanding the effects of trauma is a vital training requirement for staff working with individuals repeatedly exposed to violence, since it is not uncommon for them to suffer from vicarious traumatization and stress.  In this light, it is imperative that programs providing services to abused women have staff that is properly trained in addressing the aftereffects of trauma in their clients, as well as in themselves.  A nationally known organizational trauma and vicarious traumatization model of recovery known as Safety-physically and emotionally, Affect Management, Grief/Grieving, and Emancipation (S.A.G.E.) is required.  WAA has selected this model for its staff, upon completion of their training which will be conducted.  The trauma recovery training will prepare staff to deal more effectively with the aftereffects of trauma, while the client data tracking system will assist WAA in the identification of trends, services needed, and ways of improving the delivery of its services.  The period of performance for this effort is for twenty-two (22) months from date of award.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities no later than October 12, 2004 at 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time to robin.doyle@mms.gov - NO PHONE CALLS will be accepted.  This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information received will be considered by the Government.

Specifically, the effort will provide support on the C-130 and KC-130 radios, transponders, crypto equipment associated with radios and transponders, radio navigation systems, and altimeters.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA), Indoor Environments Division (IED) intends to award a fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The purpose of this acquisition is to (a) assist ORIA in developing objective and science-based criteria for evaluating product emission measurement and assessment practices; and (b) provide preliminary evaluation of current programs based on the developed criteria for potential sources of indoor environmental  contamination. The work under this Purchase Order will be based on analysis of currently available data and not based on any product testing.  Products (building materials, cleaning products, office equipment, etc.) used within buildings are potential sources of indoor environmental contamination.  There is a growing interest, especially in the green building movement, to purchase and use products which limit negative public health impacts from exposure to chemical emissions from these products. Although public health impacts from their emissions are difficult to accurately evaluate,  industries and third-party organizations have begun to label, certify or classify products as better for public health and the environment. However, the quality and merit of practices used to establish these labeling and certification claims and to assess the impacts of products vary greatly and  have not be adequately evaluated. The measurement and assessment practices and evaluation will be used to assist EPA in developing guidance that can be used by manufacturers, green products standards and certification programs, purchasers and others who make decisions on products and product  purchasing, with a focus limited to products that might impact public health by off-gassing chemical contaminants into the indoor environment during product use. For this requirement, the Contractor will draft specific criteria for evaluating practices used to assess products with regards to  chemical emissions and their public health impact. Based on these criteria, the Contractor will complete a preliminary evaluation of no fewer than five current practices, including those used in prominent labeling and certification programs. The EPA has determined that a possibility for Conflicts  of Interest (COIs) may exist for some organizations (i.e. those with product standards and certification programs, or manufacturers with labeling practices). The Request for Quote (RFQ) will include EPAAR (EPA Acquisition Regulation) 1552.209-72 -- ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 1984) and  EPAAR 1552.209-70 -- ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST NOTIFICATION (APR 1984). The applicable COI clauses will be included in the resultant Purchase Order award, and  EPA is considering what actions may be necessary to avoid, neutralize and mitigate potential COI after award. The RFQ will be  available on or after 10/14/04. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services, with a size standard of $6.0 million. Interested qualified small businesses should contact the Contract Specialist at  rodgers.jami@epa.gov for a copy of the RFQ.

<DESC>Air Force Space and Missiles System Center, Global Positioning System (GPS) Joint Program Office (SMC/GPK) solicits the fabrication, assembly, and test of six (6) GPS Block IIF Rubidium Clocks.  Perkin Elmer is the sole manufacturer of these clocks.  Space qualified clocks are the heart of the GPS.  They are essential to provide accurate position, velocity and time data to the GPS users.  The GPS satellite Programs have maintained a requirement for having two, dissimilar atomic clock technologies on every satellite to prevent a design flaw from degrading or eliminating all satellite mission performance.  The GPS Block IIF Program has met this requirement by using Rubidium (Rb) and Cesium (Cs) atomic clock designs, unique to GPS' demanding requirements, from separate manufacturers.  Thus Cs and Rb clocks are the only space qualified clock technologies currently available to meet the GPS Block IIF satellite requirements. Any contract(s) awarded as a result of this announcement are intended to reduce risk and advance technology required for the future of GPS Block IIF Rubidium Clocks. Interested offerors are highly encouraged to view and/or download the full solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) homepage at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Direct questions to the Contracting Point of Contact identified in the announcement.  The NAICS code is 541710 and the size standard is 1000 employees. Note 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Commanding Officer, United States Marine Corps, Henderson Hall, Arlington, Virginia, announced today its tentative decision to retain in-house the Base Operating Services for the Henderson Hall Complex. This decision is the result of a competitive process conducted in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76. There were approximately 23 military and civilian personnel performing the functions under study. The decision to retain the performance of the functions in-house was made after a detailed study indicated it was more cost effective to continue to perform the functions by reorganizing Governmental personnel rather than by contract. As a result of the efficiencies identified in the study, it is expected that a number of these positions will be eliminated. A 20 day appeal period commences on the date of announcement, Thursday, September 30, 2004 and will continue through close of business Wednesday, October 20, 2004. Appeals of the decision should be mailed or delivered to the Commanding Officer, NAVFAC Washington, 1314 Harwood Street, SE, Washington, DC 20374-5018, Attention: Danny Stubbs. Resolution of any appeals will occur within 30 days following conclusion of the appeals period. Implementation of the Government’s Most Efficient Organization (MEO) will not take place until all appeals are resolved.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

	This is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) from the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), Office of Space Launch (OSL), Advanced Programs Division (APD).  It is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraph 6.102(d)(2) which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Contracts awarded as a result of proposals submitted in response to this BAA are considered to be the result of competition to the maximum extent practicable.   

	The NRO may contract with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research in those areas covered in this BAA.  The intent of the Advanced Programs Division is to investigate and develop concepts and technologies that will enable the NRO to meet future launch needs.  Our goal is to develop technologies that provide the best possible launch capabilities for our users when and where needed in the most cost-effective manner.  Specific research interests and objectives covered by this BAA are found in Section 1.  Proposed research should investigate truly new and unique approaches and techniques that lead to, or enable revolutionary and evolutionary improvements in capability, performance, and cost.   

	Offerors may submit proposals on any topic either contained within this BAA or related to a BAA topic.  Prior to submitting a proposal, offerors shall contact the Technical Points of Contact (POC), identified with the description of the corresponding research.  The type of research effort contemplated should be understood and validated by the OSL technical representative prior to a potential Offeror expending extensive time and effort preparing a detailed technical proposal.  Proposals submitted that have not been pre-coordinated with the appropriate technical POC shall not be evaluated or otherwise be considered for contract award.  In addition, Offerors shall identify on the cover page of their proposal which of the three (3) topic areas (by topic number and title) is/are addressed in their proposal.  Offerors are reminded that this exchange of information in no way implies the Government will fund the concept once formally submitted in a proposal.  Offerors are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the Government to any agreement involving expenditure of Government funds.  

	The period of performance for proposals submitted in response to this BAA may be up to a maximum of one (1) year.  Proposals shall contain a brief summary of the work and a ceiling rough order of magnitude (CROM) price.  It is the Government’s intent to restrict the value of any contract awarded as a result of this BAA to a maximum price of $350K per contract.  The Government anticipates award of contracts not later than 1 Mar 2005.  Offerors shall submit proposals not later than 29 November 2004 with a proposal validity date through 1 April 2005.  Offerors are cautioned that award of any contract(s) pursuant to this BAA is subject to the availability of funds.

	All written communications, including submission of proposals pursuant to this 
BAA, shall be forwarded to the OSL Contracting Office Point of Contact, Ms. Debra Hawkins, Contracting Officer, who can be reached at (310) 416-7453.  Please call Ms. Hawkins only if you have questions of a contractual nature.  Technical questions/comments should be directed to the technical points of contact listed in Section 1 herein.
 
SECTION 1 - RESEARCH INTERESTS: Specific technology areas of interest for this BAA are listed below:

Topic 1:  Parts Certification and Qualification:  The primary goal of this BAA topic area is to seek new, improved and/or innovative methods for providing high confidence that all of the parts, components and flight hardware for launch vehicles (boosters, solid rocket motors, upper stages, etc.) are accurately built to the correct specification and will perform as intended.  This is directly related to OSL’s Mission Assurance process.  Recent NRO experience with both boosters as well as spacecraft programs has demonstrated that problems down to the piece part level are being discovered late in the processing cycle and result in unforeseen program delays.  This, in turn, results in schedule slips, higher program costs, and perturbations to master program schedules.  These parts problems often have the unintended consequence of crossing over to other booster or satellite programs and result in negative impacts.

The root cause for recent parts problems is unknown.  Some speculation points to an aging work force giving way to a younger inexperienced work force.  While determining the root cause with any degree of confidence may be unachievable, the overall focus on parts reliability remains our focus.  Offerors should address the entire parts production process to include, but not limited to, the following:  manufacturing, testing, quality control, screening, certification, qualification, standardization, re-work, configuration control and reliability.  We are also interested in commercially produced parts that have both space and non-space applications and understanding the differences in the production processes but not to the exclusion of satellite vehicle production processes.  Offerors should attempt to identify the potential benefits of their concepts to the launch integration community specifically focusing on the mission assurance process.  Offerors are discouraged from submitting proposals that require the creation of new software or databases.

Topic 2:  Advanced Launch Vehicle Technologies for Operationally Responsive Space Launch:  Several initiatives external to the NRO are underway that focus on a responsive space launch capability.  For example, the Chief of Staff, Air Force (CSAF) has embraced a new concept called Joint Warfighting Space (JWS) to rapidly launch satellites in direct support of a joint force commander.  The AF Scientific Advisory Board is just completing a study on Operationalizing Space Launch.  This study focused on launching a 1000 lb satellite within 48 hours.  Similarly, OSL is interested in a responsive launch capability.  OSL is interested in improvements, innovative methods, technologies, unique ideas, etc. that would render existing launch systems more responsive.  Additionally, OSL is interested in new launch systems that provide a more responsive launch capability.  This new launch system should address smaller satellites (1000 kg) and focus on simplified methods for payload integration, test, checkout and launch.  Each approach should have a payoff in terms of schedule, cost and risk mitigation that is consistent with the established OSL mission assurance process.

The primary purpose of this topic is to focus on launch capabilities for technical demonstration satellites.  The NRO is developing a plan to launch at least one tech demo satellite per year.  The OSL mission includes being able to provide a launch service for each of these tech demo satellites and ensure that the overall mission integration process for each of these satellites can be accomplished in an efficient manner.  Offerors should include enough technical detail on the proposed system to enable OSL to assess its technical maturity and feasibility.  The tech demo satellite program will not be successful if the associated launch services cannot support the annual launch timeline.  Offerors are discouraged from submitting proposals that require the creation of new software or databases.

Topic 3: New Approaches for Secondary Payloads: OSL is interested in approaches for secondary payloads that will not complicate the integration of the prime satellite with the boost vehicle.  Unique payload adaptors, below the prime satellite, complicate the integration process to an extent that the primes are reluctant to entertain ride sharing.  These special adaptors reduce available payload fairing volume for the prime and complicate loads analyses by moving the prime satellite forward in the payload fairing envelope.  The ideal ride share approach would provide the small satellite to the prime early in the schedule so that it could be included in all systems level tests performed by the prime.  The required analyses would be so benign that no additional effort would have to be performed by the prime.  Typical objections of prime satellites to ride sharing are:  
-	The sub-satellite/adaptor creates a unique loads case, which increases the complexity of the prime’s analyses 
-	The sub-satellite is not available early in the prime’s build schedule and, therefore, cannot be integrated in the systems level tests
-	There is added risk to environments e.g. contamination, thermal, shock, acoustics, vibration, etc.
-	The sub-satellite characteristics (weight, volume, etc.) are not available until late in the schedule
-	The sub-satellites typically are on a very small and tight budget and cannot be flexible enough to support to prime’s schedule changes

Offerors are discouraged from submitting proposals that provide lengthened adaptors for the purpose of carrying small satellites below the prime satellite.  The offerors are encouraged to provide unique approaches that will not be objectionable to primary missions.  Any approach that encourages the primes to seek sub-satellites as a ride share would be of special interest.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
Background:
The Nevada Test Site (NTS) power system is a 138 kV primary power transmission loop, approximately 100 miles in length.  The NTS is located remotely (about 60 miles north of Las Vegas, Nevada) from large sources of power and therefore has two distinct power sources.  The 138 kV primary power transmission loop is fed from Nevada Power Company (NPC) and the Valley Electric Association (VEA).  Source one is a 138 kV transmission line which connects the NTS system to NPC at the Mercury Switching Center (MSC), and a line between Jackass Flat Substation (JF) and MSC provides a feed at that point.  The second source to the NTS is tied to the VEA via a 138 kV transmission line which runs from JF to the VEA Substation at Lathrop Wells.  
This Overall Task Order Subcontract is to furnish the following Technical Services:
1.	Provide testing and commissioning services for the Nevada Test Site (NTS) power transmission and distribution systems for new and existing substations, as well as periodic additions and upgrades to these systems.
2.	The support will include inspection and testing services to assure that all new and upgraded electrical equipment is functional and operational within industry and manufacturer’s tolerances and is installed in accordance with the design documents.
3.	 The Testing Firm (Subcontractor) shall provide all material, equipment, labor, and technical supervision to perform such tests and inspections
4.	The tests and inspections shall determine suitability for energization of specified equipment and systems.
5.	The Subcontractor shall be responsible for implementing all interim and final settings and adjustments on protective devices in accordance with the Contractor’s specified values.
6.	The Subcontractor must be familiar with and use Electrocon International’s CAPE programs for relay setting calculations and setting input.
7.	The Subcontractor must be familiar with and use the SEL-5010 computerized program for setting the Schweitzer relays.

<DESC>Subject

Request for Information (RFI) for a comprehensive data backup solution designed to provide reliable local data protection for the Enterprise Information Technology Services (EITS).

Background

Enterprise Information Technology Services (EITS) is the collective term used to refer to the integrated instantiation of three distinct, but interconnected, services within the USMC system domain:
·	Common IT Infrastructure (CII)
·	Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)
·	Shared Data Environment (SDE)

Common IT Infrastructure (CII)
The CII comprises a disciplined and standardized hardware, software, and firmware baseline that forms the basis of the USMC IT Centers. The CII hosts a variety of database systems and applications. Its primary components are Dell Servers linked to a Symmetrix Storage Area Network (SAN).

Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)
The COOP provides a comprehensive planning, infrastructure, and execution framework to prevent unacceptable loss of CII capability while continuing USMC business and processes. This capability is based on data transfer and replication over a dispersed geographical area and is distinct from the scope of the local backup requested in this RFI.

Shared Data Environment (SDE)
The SDE establishes the foundation for managing data in a net-centric environment. It directly supports a subset of the Global Information Grid Enterprise Services (GIG-ES).

Description

In it entirety, EITS will provide the Marine Corps with IT Centers (ITC) offering the physical infrastructure, the storage, the software, and the services required to host USMC application systems and databases. This consolidation of computing power and storage in centralized and managed centers will furnish the Marine Corps with robust production, testing, and development environments, and with expert and comprehensive IT services.

From a physical standpoint, EITS will offer:
·	Storage Capacity on Storage Area Networks (SAN)
·	Network Bandwidth
·	Server Equipment
·	System Software
·	Electrical Power
·	Cooling and Environmental Systems
·	Physical Security

This baseline will host multiple database systems and applications in a custom N-tier architecture which will include load balanced servers, database clusters, and multiple application servers. Furthermore, EITS will provide the requisite administrative and management services to fully support the hosted systems. In particular, these services will include:
·	Cluster Management
·	Operating System Administration
·	Database Administration
·	Content Distribution
·	Server Load Balancing
·	Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP)/Continuity of Operations Planning (COOP)
·	Advanced Monitoring and Reporting

Currently, there exist two EITS centers: site 1 at Quantico and site 2 at the Navy Annex.

Requirements

This RFI specifically seeks technical options for the implementation and deployment of a local data backup solution for EITS. For each such option the following information is required:
·	Option Description
·	Hardware Specification
·	Software Specification
·	Training Requirements
·	Cost Estimates
·	Schedule Estimates

Specifications

This section provides the high-level technical and functional requirements for this RFI. The proposed local backup solutions will need to be instantiated in two geographically separate sites with each site’s backup being completely independent of each other.

Quantitative Specifications Site 1

	Current	Expected
Data Storage	15TB	40TB
Backup Window	86400sec	86400sec
Throughput	174MB/sec	463MB/sec

Quantitative Specifications Site 2

	Current	Expected
Data Storage	15TB	75TB
Backup Window	86400sec	86400sec
Throughput	174MB/sec	868MB/sec

Qualitative Specifications

Platform		Architecture	
	Redhat Linux		SAN
	MS Windows 2000	Network	
	MS Windows 2003		Gigabit Ethernet
	HP-UX 11.x		Fibre Channel
	Solaris 7	Location	
	Solaris 8		Adjoining
	Solaris 9	Other	
	IBM AS400		Scalability
Hardware			Remote Access
	EMC Symmetrix		

It is imperative to clarify that the described COOP capability of EITS is outside the scope of this RFI and will remain totally separate from any option presented as a response to this document.

Any response has to provide a local backup solution for data protection and has to meet the presented quantifiable requirements and account for the qualitative ones.

Solutions that have been considered included tape library backups, disk backups, SAN mirroring backups, and combinations thereof. Responses may include any of these concepts or other original options or configurations.

Responders are encouraged to contact the Technical POC and make arrangements for site tours and for more information.

All communications must be in writing to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Christine M. Kuney, kuneycm@mcsc.usmc.mil

Please submit responses via email in MS Office compatible format by 07/30/2004, to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD intends to procure airframe Depot level maintenance for the Navy and Marine C-9B/DC-9 aircraft.  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to request statements of interest to support the procurement of Depot level maintenance for C-9B/DC-9 aircraft.  Engine Depot is not anticipated to be included in this procurement. The DC9s are slated for retirement and will require only limited maintenance, such as drop-ins and field teams. The Government has a requirement to procure a base year plus 4 options. The Navy and Marines currently operate 17 C-9Bs and 4 DC9s worldwide. These aircraft are an “off-the-shelf’ version of the commercial DC-9 aircraft and differ slightly from the rest of commercial DC-9 fleet due to Navy unique modifications. Parts, material, Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) maintenance documentation, manuals, and necessary OEM engineering source data are commercially available. However, there may be the necessity to maintain a licensing agreement with the OEM. The prime contractor and subcontractors must be Aircraft Repair Station licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 145 to participate in this effort. The primary performance objective is to provide the aircraft depot maintenance services necessary to meet the C-9B/DC-9 aircraft operational requirements. This also includes field team maintenance that occurs away from the Contractor’s designated depot facility, via Contractor Field Teams or Contractor selected Subcontractors and Vendors. The contract type will be a requirements type contract with no minimum or maximum ordering requirements due to the uncertain number and timing of aircraft retirements. The contract may or may not include modification work for planned upgrades.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE AN INLINE EVENFLOW MATERIAL DISTRIBUTOR FOR PNEUMATIC MATERIAL FEED SYSTEMS
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE AN INLINE EVENFLOW MATERIAL DISTRIBUTOR FOR PNEUMATIC MATERIAL FEED SYSTEMS

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), seeks one or more industry partners further develop and commercialize its Inline Evenflow Material Distributor for Pneumatic Material Feed Systems.

Pneumatic material feed systems are known to have clogging problems in the feed lines that cause frequent shutdowns to clean-out the lines. One known solution to the clogging problem in pneumatic material feed systems is to dry materials in an oven to remove all moisture to prevent the agglomeration of abrasives in the system. This process is time consuming, results in high energy costs, and does not completely alleviate the clogging. 

LLNL has developed an inline evenflow material distributor technology that solves the ongoing problem of abrasive materials clogging in water jet machining systems, resulting in better efficiency and reliability of the system. LLNL’s technology replaces drying ovens and lowers energy costs while increasing productivity in pneumatic delivery applications for powdered or granular abrasion materials. Utilizing this inline evenflow technology enabled LLNL to use otherwise unusable moisture ridden garnet abrasive without difficulty, saving time, energy, and materials.

A patent is pending on LLNL’s inline evenflow material distributor that can be used in pneumatic systems for any material that is affected by moisture or where clogging and clumping is a common problem. LLNL’s inline evenflow material distributor technology provides even distribution of ambient moisture ridden materials in pneumatic supply systems; it allows the use of abrasives that have excessive moisture (due to relative humidity) in waterjet machining applications; and it minimizes excessive/erratic flow rates of abrasive to the mixing tube. Disruptions in cutting action reduces productivity and edge quality.
 
LLNL is utilizing its inline evenflow material distributor technology for metal cutting applications. The device is scalable and can be applied wherever pneumatic material delivery systems are used including waterjet machining, abrasive/sandblasting, industries that use large dryers and/or build machinery for the chemical industry, automotive industry, food processing, and pharmaceutical manufacturing.

 
Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in developing and commercializing LLNL's inline evenflow material distributor technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and Address
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 95-04

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in developing and commercializing LLNL's evenflow material distributor technology.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposer's Day Announcement - High-Precision Long-Range Laser Designator/Locator (HPLD)
<DESC>PROPOSERS’ DAY CONFERENCE:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) will host a Proposers’ Day Workshop in support of the High-Precision Long-Range Laser Designator/Locator (HPLD) program on October 20, 2004 at the Hilton Arlington & Towers, 950 North Stafford St., Arlington, VA 22203 beginning at 8:30am and lasting until 2:30pm.  The purpose of this Conference is to provide information on the HPLD program, promote additional discussion on this topic, address questions from potential proposers and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.

The objective of the HPLD program is to develop and demonstrate new target-in-the-loop active optics (AO) approaches and novel high accuracy pointing methods.  This new technology will be demonstrated in an affordable, small, laser-target-designator/locator package that will enable the user to observe, track, and designate a target at operationally significant ranges.  DARPA anticipates that these new target-in-the-loop active optics (AO) approaches and novel, high-accuracy pointing methods could enable a single operator to precisely determine, within a 1m spherical error, the Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates of a target up to 10 km away.

The AO and associated processing of the device will be capable of controlling the spot size and correcting/stabilizing the beam and image line-of-sight for atmospheric turbulence and platform jitter.  These capabilities will vastly improve the performance of small handheld and UAV optical systems.

These new target-in-the-loop AO approaches will be different than the current astronomic-based systems.  There will be a long horizontal path at ground level with significant turbulence along the entire path.  The target has real extent, depth, and surface roughness, and there is no compliant beacon or guide star to aid atmospheric compensation.  These features, coupled with the additional requirements that the system be small, power-efficient, and affordable, force a new set of solutions.  These new optical components, control methodologies, and digital processing required to operate in this environment are at the core of this solicitation.

To focus the design effort, DARPA has selected a handheld laser target designator/locator system as the target application and demonstration vehicle for the HPLD technology.  This device will be used by ground combat elements that conduct terminal attack control (TAC) and call for fire (CFF).  Therefore, it should be designed to support their full range of operations and deployment methods, and be able to survive in a harsh environment for long periods of time with minimal maintenance.  At a minimum, the device must be capable of day and night operation, target observation, designation and location at 10 km, and communication with other devices.  Once the position is precisely determined, the operator should be able to observe, track, and laser-designate the target as required, using a single device.  The system might consist of the device, tripod, and any other components necessary to achieve the required pointing accuracy calibration.  Once calibrated in a location, the device should be able to operate without any outside aid other than GPS.  

A Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is anticipated to follow soon.    

REGISTRATION INFORMATION
Please send an e-mail to BAA05-01@darpa.mil not later than October 12, 2004 if you plan to attend.

The incumbent will lead any communications and field contacts needed for further investigations related to any of the injury cases.  The contractor shall hire personnel whose work will support aspects of the following:  This study of nonfatal injuries and illnesses in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) is by direction of the Assistant Secretary of Defense/Health Affairs to provide a better understanding of the medical issues related to the military operations in Iraq.  As agents of OASD/HA, investigators at USUHS will collect and analyze deployment and medical data from multiple sources within the Military Health System (MHS) in order to describe types and circumstances of nonfatal injuries and illnesses in the theater of operations with a focus on identifying potential points of preventive intervention.  The primary work site is the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS).  A secondary work site is the Deployment Health Support Directorate, Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Health Protection and Medical Readiness, Washington, DC, primarily for purposes of coordinating or facilitating data collection efforts.  The study will be under the direction of the principal investigators at USUHS, where the bulk of the analyses will be performed.  METHODS:  This is a descriptive epidemiologic analysis of the types and causes of nonfatal injuries and illnesses resulting from OIF, with a focus on the identification of health risk and possible safety issues as well as potential preventive interventions.  Investigators will identify, access, and characterize automated medical data on all nonfatal injury or illness events from multiple sources.  Unique identifiers will be used to link multiple databases to integrate in theater medical information, if possible.  An integrated database containing demographic, military service, and medical information will be constructed from available sources and will be assessed in terms of data elements, quality, missing information, and adequate numbers.  Investigators expect to have access to data from the following sources:  Service Casualty Office information – cases to include all nonfatal casualties identified by the casualty offices as wounded in action (WIA), both hostile and non-hostile; Safety investigation report – all nonfatal accident cases identified by the safety offices (which should overlap with the above); Joint Medical Work Station (JMeWS) – Disease Non-Battle Injury (DNBI) reports and electronic theater patient encounter records; TRANSCOM Regulating and Command and Control Evacuation System (TRAC2ES) – medical evacuations from theater; Theater Inpatient Admissions (if electronically available); Electronic individual medical data from the Defense Medical Surveillance System (entrance physical exam, inpatient and outpatient visits, personnel and deployment history, pre-and post-deployment health assessments).  For each case of nonfatal injury/illness identified for OIF through WIA, TRAC2ES, and Safety data systems during a 12-month period, all of the above electronic records will be sought and the data elements compiled, reviewed, abstracted, and summarized. Information that is coded and recorded in an analyzable format will be evaluated to determine reason for evacuation (if applicable) and the relationship to pre-deployment health status, mission factors, and safety and other issues. Descriptive analyses will integrate information from as many data sources as possible, and focus on force health protection issues, preventability of injuries and illnesses, similarities of circumstances, and operational/medical issues.  This study involves computerized demographic and health information and illness codes generated within the Military Healthcare System (MHS).  Once health information is linked, individual patient identifiers will be removed to protect patient confidentiality.  No individual patients will ever be traced, contacted, or notified.  Release of any information will be in aggregate form only.  For each medical event, the following factors will be assessed depending on data availability: Activity/Circumstances; Medical diagnosis and outcome; Pre-deployment health status; Mission factors; Other relevant factors.  DELIVERABLES:  Work on this study will conclude when the in-theater OIF medical database has been created, characterized, and analyzed.  This project is expected to be completed within approximately 12 months and will result in the following deliverables:  The final database constitutes a product with potential benefit to medical planners by (1) providing information on the strengths and weaknesses of the existing data collection and management system during military operations; (2) establishing whether or not existing medical data sources are adequate to address force health protection issues and to identify points for preventive measures; and (3) establishing a mechanism for using automated medical data to assess patterns and trends in medical events, which may be useful in predicting future health services resource needs in similar operational settings.  Detailed report of study findings for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, including analysis, conclusions, and recommendations.  Publishable manuscript(s) for a peer-reviewed medical journal.  Final report accounting for budget, procedures, and other administrative issues.  MANAGEMENT OF PROTOCOL WORK: The principal investigators, or their designated representatives, will supervise all activities related to this protocol and delegate responsibilities and resources to associate investigators and contract personnel as appropriate.  Non-federal research support personnel will sign a standard form to ensure compliance with all federal regulations related to privacy issues.  All manuscripts, presentations, and interviews regarding this work must first be approved and coordinated by the principal investigators and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense-Health Affairs, in addition to all other standard clearance procedures.  TIMELINE:  The period of performance is 12-months from date of award to provide review and analysis of nonfatal injuries and illness occurring in the OIF theater of operations.  Work on this study will conclude when the results of analyses have been summarized, and the findings have been interpreted and reported.  Study investigators will prepare a final written report to the Assistant Secretary of Defense-Health Affair, as well as manuscript(s) for publication in the peer-reviewed literature by the end of the 12-month period of performance.

<SUBJECT>B -- School Leadership Program Grantee Project Evaluations
<SOLNBR>eeud0403
<RESPDATE>090904
<CONTACT>Jay Zagursky, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-245-6132, Fax 202-245-6297, Email Jay.Zagursky@ed.gov
<DESC>The purpose of the proposed contract is to assist the Department of Education (ED) to review and provide technical assistance to the School Leadership Program (SLP) grantees on their project evaluations. More specifically, the contractor will work with ED to review the SLP evaluation frameworks, and to design a format for bringing the grantees together to hear about and discuss their approaches to developing their evaluation methodologies, what they learned from the process, their expectations for the value and use of the evaluation results, and provide technical assistance support to strengthen those evaluations. This effort will provide an opportunity to capitalize on the experiences and lessons learned from the participants to inform the current as well as future SLP program evaluations.

The School Leadership Program grants support projects that develop, enhance or expand programs to recruit, train and mentor assistant principals and principals for high-need school districts. Grant awards assist local education agencies (LEAs) in partnership with other entities to develop, document, evaluate and disseminate innovative, cohesive models of preparation of and support for assistant principals and principals. These programs combine active recruitment of diverse and talented individuals, a rigorous selection process, high-quality coursework in instructional and managerial leadership with internships and mentor support to increase the quality and quantity of school leaders for rural and urban schools. For additional information about the SLP program, please visit the program web site at http://www.ed.gov/programs/leadership/index.html.

As a result of the FY 2002 SLP grant competition, 24 projects were funded. Twenty (20) of the grantees will begin the 3rd year, and 4 will begin the 2nd year of their grants on October 1, 2004. While the application for the SLP grants included a requirement to conduct an evaluation of their programs, grantees were given flexibility in the framing and implementation of those evaluations.  While this made some sense given that grantees were implementing a variety of approaches to recruiting, training and support school leaders, the result is a wide range of evaluation designs across the 24 grants. ED is seeking a better understanding of the approaches and strategies used by the grantees to develop their evaluation methodologies and questions, and to engage them in a discussion of their outcomes and how to best use and disseminate them. To do that, ED is proposing to bring together the grantees and their evaluators with others engaged in similar efforts together to hear how they framed their evaluations—successes and challenges--and, their perceptions of how the results may be used to enhance our knowledge of the effectiveness of practices to develop school leaders. Participants will also be asked to provide suggestions or recommendations on the types of technical assistance support that would be most helpful to them and others developing evaluations for similar projects or programs. 

The contractor would provide assistance to ED in four areas by 1) reviewing and preparing an overview report of SLP evaluation frameworks, 2) providing technical expertise in framing and developing the meeting content and format, 3) assisting with logistical arrangements for the meeting, and 4) preparing a summary report of the meeting outcomes with recommendations for technical assistance strategies for current and future grantees on the design and implementation of project evaluations. ED estimates that approximately 50 project directors and evaluators will attend the meeting as well as up to an additional 50 other participants including ED staff and others from organizations and foundations engaged in school leadership efforts. It is expected that all participants will be responsible for their own travel expenses.

ED will give preference to bidders who demonstrate the following expertise and experience:

Preference for a contractor that previous experience in working with or conducting research on school leadership programs; 

Preference for a contractor that has previous experience in designing and conducting program evaluations; and,

Preference for a contractor that has previous experience conducting and facilitating meetings. 

The deliverables are described below:

Task 1: Prepare a report on the strengths and weaknesses of the 24 SLP grantee evaluation frameworks (will be provided to the contractor within five days of the contract award.) 

The contractor shall prepare an overview of the 24 grantees' evaluation designs. The report will provide information to ED on commonalities across the evaluation methodologies and questions, and on how the information may be used to inform meeting with grantees and their evaluators. 

Deliverables: 5-10 page report.

Task 2: Design and develop a meeting agenda and format that proposes outcomes, based on the review conducted in Task 1, that includes 1) Meeting expectations and outcomes; 2) A framework and/or set of key questions to structure the meeting discussion; 3) A process and format for engaging participants; 4) Suggested speakers and/or facilitators; and 5) A process for documenting the outcomes.

Deliverables: 1) Agenda; 2) Outline of Meeting Content and Materials; 3) Description of Meeting Format; 4) List of Proposed Facilitators and Speakers.

Task 3:	Complete the logistical arrangements for the meeting that includes: 1) Contracting with a hotel in Washington, DC; 2) Preparing meeting materials; 3) Providing facilitators and recorders; 4) Conducting the meeting; and 5) Processing travel arrangements for consultants and/or facilitators.

QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED AND ANSWERED


1. Is there an incumbent for this activity?

 

 

No.

 

2. We would like to see what a CDC looks like.  Is there a sample that 

we could access?

 

Not sure the vendor needs to see a CDC at this point.  Our CDCs are multi volume (usually 3) paper-based courses.  They are B&W with still graphics, some foldouts and schematics. Each Unit has self-check short answer questions and the answers are provided in the back of the book. Our AFIADL website has a catalog that describes the courses.

 

3. It seems that AFIADL already has a Learning Management System and 

Content Repository.  Is it assumed that the e-CDC system would leverage 

that infrastructure?

 

Yes.

 

4. Has AFIADL coordinated their e-learning architectures with other 

agencies?

 

Our systems are conformant to OSD's ADL specifications and standards:   www.ADLnet.org

 

5. The SOW specifies a task to recommend R&D priorities for e-CDC.  Is 

this development oriented? Is it separate from other AFIADL R&D?

 

Not sure at this point.  Vendor will have discretion to recommend what needs to be studied and evaluated in the future based on findings.

<DESC>Technical Questions regarding the "Research Scientific Personnel
Support for the Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) Project" RFQ (solicitation
#PMB4038).


As a result of questions asked from an offeror, this requirement is amended to provide the following clarifications:  


1.    The RFQ indicates that primary work site would be USUHS and secondary work site is Deployment Health Support Directorate, ASD(FH).  Is it sufficient if the Project Coordinator and the Senior Epidemiologist are in Bethesda for access and response to USUHS and other staff members are at USUHS only as necessary (determined by the PD)?  


No, it is not sufficient, on site is required, with additional staff at USU as needed. 

 
     a.    Could the other three positions be located outside of Bethesda? 


No, must be located at USU.


     b.    If the data is electronic, is the physical presence of staff at USUHS immaterial? 


Data is electronic, but there are too many issues that will require close contact with USU Principal Investigators (PIs).  Efficient staffing for complex data management requires on-site at USU.


2.    Does the Data Abstractor have to physically go to military installations to get the data?  Hence, should we cost travel to some installations and if so which ones?


No. I do not think travel will be necessary.  You aren’t required to travel to any installations.  


3.    The RFQ sounds as if it is describing individuals, e.g. one data abstractor.  Could there be two or more data abstractors if that is necessary to efficiently gather the data so long as the total number of hours allocated to those two individuals does not exceed 960?  


Yes, you the contractor has to assure the staff you are providing can accomplish the work as outlined in the synopsis. 


4.    What is expected in the option years? 

The option years will involve additional data management and analyses.

<DESC>Technical Questions:

As a result of questions asked from an offeror, this requirement is amended to provide the following clarifications:

1)What is the level of epidemiologic expertise and experience needed?  
	
At the minimum the listed positions should have the following qualifications:

The Project Coordinator – MS with experience in oversight of research projects;

Senior Epidemiologist – PhD, DrPH or MD/MPH with 15 years of experience in the design and conduct of epidemiologic studies, especially those of military relevance, and extensive experience with military data systems;         

Senior Analyst – Masters with 6 years of experience of PhD with 2 or more years of experience;       

Research Associate – Masters or Bachelors with 2 years of experience; and        

Data Abstractor – Certified medical record abstractor, preferably experienced in military data.        


2)  Will study design, analysis and interpretation be needed?  Or is it more of a data collection activity under USUHS direction? 

Not much needed in the way of study design--this is a descriptive study.  Yes, to directed data collection activities, analysis, and interpretation.  Project entails a complex process of identifying, characterizing, evaluating, selecting, and integrating data from multiple DoD sources (different formats); constructing an analyzable data set; performing appropriate analyses; and interpreting the results.

<DESC>FOR FULL AMENDMENT 02 LANGUAGE, INCLUDING THE SF 30 AMENDMENT FACE PAGE, PLEASE WRITE TO TJ.MCLAREN@CPA-IQ.ORG.  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERS ARE A CONTINUATION OF AMENDMENT 01 QUESTION AND ANSWERS, POSTED 03OCT04.


34.	Question: Under Section 2.3, "execute contingency perimeter security of the An Numaniyah ASP", is this intended by the government to mean the 16 square km additional facility as depicted on the map at figure 1, page 11 of 42,  in the original Statement of Work? 

The bidder is referred to the answer in Question number 35.
 
35	Question: Will there be an additional Option CLIN developed in order to provide a price for this service at the additional facility depicted as the An Numaniyah ASP, which could actually be larger in size and scope than the An Numaniyah Base Garrison? 

The Government will not be placing another CLIN on the solicitation.  The SOW states the security force is to be prepared to assume security of the ASP if the base commander deems the ASP as a threat. The current ASP is located on the base and the proposed ASP is currently under construction with an estimated completing date of November. Per the engineers the off site location maybe a range only since an ASP was constructed on the base. If the ASP is moved off the base and to the site, bidder would be required to provide minimal security forces upon completion since the danger will not be to the garrison compound itself or its personnel. This will require 24 hours security patrols of two vehicles and one mounted tower.


SOW `CLARIFICATIONS
36.	Section 1.3, Page 4 of 42; The Al Kasik Military Training Base actually has three (3) ECP’s, one at the site of the old front gate that is manned by 4th BDE soldiers, another at the main gate manned by incumbent contractor.  There is also a contractor’s gate that is manned by third party contractor security that will soon be turned over to the Commandant Base Commander (Government security).  SOW stated only one ECP – instead of three (3).

37.	Section 6.5.1.4, Page 8 of 42; – Currently the Al Kasik Military Training Base has “sufficient” ex-pats with an approximate ratio of about 7:390; the Government is recommending that the ratio of at least 1:30 (ex-pats to guards), roughly one ex-pat per platoon strength.

38.	Section 8.4, Page 9 of 42; - Government is revising the language of this section to make mandatory that the bidder must propose having at least one ex-pat at all times at this position (24/7), in addition to whatever number of other third country nationals and/or home country nationals (TCN/HCN).

39.	Section 8.6, Page 9 of 42; Government is revising the language of this section to mandate to the terms that all bidders must propose at least one ex-pat 


for all exterior patrols.  The Government has determined that this is a must for command, control and communication back to the Commandant Base Commander.

40.	Section 8.7, Page 10 of 42; – Change size to “The QRF shall consist of a platoon sized element at a minimum (30-45 persons) that can respond to a situation in fire team, squad, and platoon strength;

** Add: Security Team will provide PSD/Convoy escort to and from Ft Tal Afar (satellite installation to Al Kasik) and to the Mosul area (Diamondback, Freedom, Maurez) on schedule / on call.
