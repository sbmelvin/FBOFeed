<CONTACT>Gary Goldberg Contracting Officer 9077863408     gary_goldberg@fws.gov;
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), National Wildlife Refuge System, administers the Service's Challenge Cost Share program.  Challenge Cost Share (CCS) funds are congressionally appropriated monies designated for the protection and conservation of wildlife resources.  This is a federal matching funds program which leverages federal dollars with non-federal sources.  In addition to money, these federal dollars can be matched with in-kind valuation assigned to non-federal contributions such as labor, equipment use, material and supplies.  The non-federal matches may be contributed by State and local governments, private individuals, private organizations, business enterprises, and charitable groups.  Service policy dictates that no more than 50 percent of the total cost to implement the project may come from federally funded sources.  The CCS program encompasses awards made through both federal assistance and procurement instruments (contracts).  This "call for proposals" is the single designated annual competition through which multiple awards will be made.  A twin posting of this call for proposals # 701816R006 has been posted on http://www.grants.gov.  The Alaska National Wildlife Refuge System invites the submission of new proposals in support of Alaskan natural resource management and science camps, both as components of the 2006 CCS program. Science camps must have at least a 25 percent nonfederal match.  Project proposals must demonstrate a strong relationship between a non-federal group and an Alaskan U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service office. This is the initial announcement for this funding opportunity.  The CCS program is an annual funding source set up on the federal fiscal year schedule; therefore, the objectives and work identified in the proposals selected for award under this announcement must be completed no later than September 30, 2006.  Proposals must be delivered to Maeve Taylor at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office at 1011 East Tudor Road, Anchorage, AK by 4:00 PM Alaska Time on December 19, 2005.  Proposals may be mailed to the address below and must display a postmark earlier than December 20, 2005:  Maeve Taylor, Challenge Cost Share Coordinator; Alaska's National Wildlife Refuge System; 1011 East Tudor Road, MS#235;Anchorage, AK 99503.  Projects will be considered on or in the proximity of all 16 National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska.  Please note: (1) There is no "bidder's list" or "plan holders list" to get on.  (2) There is no printed Solicitation Packet to request.  The entire Funding Opportunity Description including examples of previous selected projects and relevant eligibility and evaluation criteria are available online at  http://alaska.fws.gov/nwr/pdf/costshare_fa.pdf   Please direct questions to Maeve_Taylor@fws.gov or contact her by calling (907) 786-3391.

<DESC>USAID intends to issue an RFP for construction services for street/road construction, rehabilitation and or repair in the West Bank and Gaza. Proposals will be sought from American and Local Palestinian Grade 1,Class A construction contractors for these construction services. 

USAID proposes to finance the construction of selected priority road segments in Gaza and the West Bank in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority’s Ministry of Planning and Ministry of Public Works & Housing as well as Local Governments. This project is part of the US led effort to support the Road Map for Peace in the Middle East. The restoration of roads improve access to markets and the movement of labor and goods and the Palestinian construction industry receives an economic boost. Road        restoration also opens job opportunities, increases the amount of materials supplied, and stimulates the manufacturing sector. 

It is USAID’s intent to award several Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contracts for these efforts within specific geographic areas of the West Bank and Gaza, with each contract being active for a three year period.  Although this solicitation will be open to U.S. Firms, current travel restrictions prohibit entry into Gaza by contractor personnel who are U..S. citizens,
U.S. Green card holders or third country nationals. U.S. Firms are also reminded of the restriction imposed by AIDAR 725.703(b), which requires at least 50% of the supervisory and key personnel working at the project site to be citizens or legal residents of the United States. No Exceptions will be authorized The selected contractors must be able to mobilize quickly and must have similar construction  experience and demonstrated capability of 
managing such projects. 

The solicitation and RFP for services indicated will be available after 17 November,2005.

<DESC>The Western Area Power Administration (Western), Upper Great Plains Region, Montana Maintenance Office intends to issue a purchase order on a sole-source bases to General Electric (GE) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The requirement is for a study to be performed by GE for modification and re-calculation of the Electromagnetics Transient Program (EMTP) for Westernâ€™s Miles City HVDC Converter Station.  GE designed and constructed the Miles City Converter Station.  The converter station is a highly complex system with complicated and involved interactions among its components.  The study is to determine if the existing S&C circuit switchers could be replaced with breakers that provide point-on-wave switching.  Western needs to perform critical equipment updates and additions to the Converter Station, which require a modification to and re-calculation of the EMTP study before designs can be started.  A critical step in the design was the EMTP study of how these components interact and their effect upon the high voltage power systems. GE has exclusive knowledge of and experience with this systemâ€™s design and operation and with the EMTP setup and parameters unique to this converter station.   The Statement of Work is available from the Contracting Officer, Holly Kittleson at kittles@wapa.gov.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DoD) SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PROGRAM 2006.1.  Small high-technology firms are encouraged to submit proposals to DoD for R&D projects with both military and commercial applications in response to SBIR solicitation 2006.1, which was publicly released on the DoD SBIR Web Site (http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir) on November 1, 2005.   The 2006.1 SBIR Solicitation will open for receipt of proposals on December 13, 2005 and will close at 6:00 AM EST, January 13, 2006.  NOTE:  Proposals received after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3).  Submissions must include the proposal cover sheets, technical proposal, Company Commercialization Report, and cost proposal to be considered a complete proposal. Six DoD components will participate in the 2006.1 solicitation – the Air Force, Chemical and Biological Defense, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Department of Navy, and United States Special Operations Command.  The solicitation lists all the R&D topics under which DoD is seeking proposals, and also contains detailed information on the parameters of the SBIR program and how to submit a proposal.  Small firms apply first for a six-month phase I award of $70,000 to $100,000 (unless otherwise specified in the component instructions) to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of a particular concept.  If phase I proves successful, the firm may be invited to apply for a two-year phase II award of $500,000 to $750,000 to further develop the concept.  Proposals must be submitted via the DOD SBIR website at “http://www.dodsbir.net/submission” following the instructions contained in the solicitation, including the instructions specified in the solicitation for the DoD component to which you are applying.  Offerors bear the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, so plan ahead and submit early.  The complete solicitation may be accessed at http://www.dodsbir.net/solicitation.  Participation in the DoD SBIR Program is restricted to small business firms organized for profit with 500 or fewer employees, including all affiliated firms. Questions may be directed to the SBIR/STTR Help Desk at (866) 724-7457 or Mr. Michael Caccuitto at (703) 588-8610, or by e-mail: michael.caccuitto@osd.mil or Ms. Tessy P.

<DESC>The Fleet & Industrial Supply Center of Jacksonville, FL, intends to procure rentals for a feed- water-processing unit to filter silicates and other minerals from water, for shipboard applications requiring de-mineralized water, for the USS John F. Kennedy, stationed in Mayport, FL.  The unit shall be capable of processing approximately 70,000 to 90,000 gallons of water daily.  At a minimum, the ship anticipates processing a minimum of 150,000 gallons each time it requests rental services, with the possibility of renting the unit for several consecutive days.  Although it is customary in the industry to charge a flat fee for renting a unit that covers up to several days’ use, interested vendors are instructed to quote the Government a DAILY rental rate to permit an unambiguous evaluation of all offers the Government receives in response to this solicitation.  The estimated quantity is for 180 rental days during the time following the date of contract award through the !  remainder of fiscal year 2006.  The solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis, open to both small and large businesses.  If an interested vendor does not have a presence in the greater Jacksonville metropolitan area, the vendor shall clearly state in its offer how the required delivery time will be met.  The solicitation may be accessed via this web site or by submitting a written request to the Contracting Officer’s e-mail address, thomas.hollinger1@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS:  Lighting Maintenance Services at Various Locations on Oahu, Hawaii.  The work includes, but is not limited to, furnishing all labor, supervision, management, tools, materials, equipment, facilities, transportation, incidental engineering, and other items necessary to provide recurring interior and exterior lighting maintenance services.

The NAICS Code for this procurement is 561790 and the annual size standard is $6,000,000.  The contract term will be a base period of one year plus four option years.  The total term of the contract, including all options, will not exceed 60 months.  If the Government does not award a follow-on contract in time, the Government may require the Contractor to continue performance for an additional period up to six months under the Option to Extend Services clause.  In either case, the Government will not synopsize the options when exercised.  During the term of the contract, the Government may authorize customers to use purchase cards to order and pay for indefinite quantity work for task orders.  This process will be implemented by a modification to the contract.  Task orders and payments shall not exceed the limits specified by the modification.  Upon issuance of the modification, the Contractor shall comply with the requirements.  The proposed contract will be a combination firm fixed-price and indefinite quantity type contract.

<DESC>MODIFICATION TO PREVIOUS NOTICE: 

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC) Maritime group seeks strong, responsive proposals from well-qualified sources to enter into a Firm Fixed price (FFP), Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC).  The proposed procurement contains an option to extend the contract period one of more times at the discretion of the government.  The total shall not exceed 5 years.  This is a sole source solicitation for the supplies listed in Section B for both DLA stock locations and military customers around the world.  CONTRACT SCOPE:  The scope of this long-term initiative is items for which Rix Industries is an approved source and/or items which Rix Industries has supplied in the past directly or through dealers, whether or not the NSNs are ultimately procured from Rix Industries, Cage Code 28953.  438 NSNs are included in this initial grouping (see listing of NSNs below).  Award will be made on an ALL OR NONE BASIS per NSN for the supplies covered under this contract.  It is currently projected that a mix of stock and Direct Vendor Delivery (DVD) orders will be issued.  The Small Business size standard is 500 employees.  Specifications, plans or drawings are NOT AVAILABLE.  This is an UNRESTRICTED acquisition.  Other Than Full and Open Competitive procedures apply.  This acquisition is for supplies for which the government does not possess complete, unrestrictive, technical data, therefore the government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) 1.  The scope of this long-term initiative is items for which Rix Industries is an approved source and/or items which Rix Industries has supplied in the past directly or through dealers, whether or not the NSNs are ultimately procured from Rix Industries, Cage Code 28953.  While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.  The initial 438 sole source NSNs are listed below.  Additional NSNs may be added to any resultant contract at a later date using the Add / Delete Clause H15D01 and are subject to synopsis in the CBD.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: The solicitation will be open for a period of 60 days after its publication at FedBizOpps.

In addition to hard copies, an electronic copy of each Offerors spreadsheet must be submitted on floppy diskette(s) or compact disk(s), according to instructions in the solicitation. Proposals submitted by fax or e-mail are NOT acceptable and will NOT be considered. DSCC will neither acknowledge receipt of nor return submissions. PROPOSAL FORMAT: Detailed instructions for completing the proposals are contained in the solicitation. Proposals not conforming to the specified format will not be reviewed or evaluated.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals received. The Government also reserves the right to fund all, or any part of, a proposal evaluated to be eligible for award. All responsible sources may submit an offer / quote, which shall be considered.

Contract  writting system problems prevented loading a complete RFP document. A word  version of the Draft RFP FA8626-05-R-2077 has been loaded to the PIXs  library below. This word version does not contain the section J  attachments which have been loaded separately to the library. Plans are to  update the draft RFP on 14 October 2005 to flesh out several aspects  including: H0XX – OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria; H081 –  Provide goals for Small Business participation; Section I Reference  Clauses – some fill-ins need filled in; Sec J – Exhibit A - add initial  CDRL Data Item Description (DID) package; Sec J – Attachment 1 – update  Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) Sections 1 -4 and Sec 6 to  eliminate redundancy and streamline the requirements; NOTE: PWS Section 5  describes the five functions, A through E,and is reasonably complete,  however Sections 1 – 4 and Section 6 need updating to streamline and add  the Service Delivery Summary (SDS)etc.; Sec L075 – Update paragraphs  7.3.2; 7.3.3; 7.3.4; for instructions on the Technical Expertise and  Systems Engineering Mission Capability sub-factors; add the tailored L-8  Labor Cost/Price spreadsheet; Sec M – Function E evaluation criteria need  added; remaining Sec M is good SIMAF Library Listing of planned contents  will be added to PIXS library Virtual Industry Day (VID) The Virtual  Industry Day (VID) Meet-Me phone number will be provided to interested  firms who register with the SIMAF POC Ms. Stiles at 937-904-7205,  Margaret.stiles@wpafb.af.mil .

Firms will be identified during the VID only by a  letter identifying their company at time of registration, e.g. Company A,  Company B, etc., actual company names will not be used. Questions on the  draft RFP for Virtual Industry Day should be e-mailed to the buyer,  Theresa hay, at Theresa.hay@wpafb.af.mil with a copy to the Program  manager, Vince Lewis at Vincent.lewis@wpafb.af.mil . Detailed questions on  format and minor issues are not the purpose of the VID. Questions that  address omissions and significant issues or areas of confusion are  desired. XR-SIMAF Library The XR-SIMAF Library is not available until 19  Oct 05 between the hours of 0900 and 1500 EST. Library appointments must  be made thru the SIMAF POC, Ms. Stiles at 937-904-7205,  Margaret.stiles@wpafb.and Buyer Name Update The XR-SIMAF draft RFP is planned for release by 11 October 2005.

Look for further information on this site for further information regarding this Virtual Industry Day. Note: New buyer Theresa Hay replaces Michelle Hendricks on all future correspondence.  ************************************************************************ Update 30 Sep 2005 - Re-Send to Fed Biz Opps - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Fed Business Opportunities site can not handle the Description in excess of 24000 characters so the original Sources Sought announcement of 17 May has been saved as a WORD file and loaded to the XR-SIMAF PIXS library below as "ORIGINAL_SOURCES_SOUGHT_ANNOUNCEMENT_17MAY05". NOTE: The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  ************************************************************************ Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant concern for successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration Services contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to reflect this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address the OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to the Government. The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  *********************************************************************** Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require offerors to submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services that involve a high level of complex skill sets. The NAICS code of 541710 remains the same however the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to 1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000 however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500 employees. The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of 500 could overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust subcontracting plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses that could provide support for this acquisition and artificially reduce subcontracting goals. Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small business participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business Administration offices.  ********************************************************************** =?646?Q?Update_18_Aug_2005_=96_Initial_Acquisit?=  =?646?Q?ion_Strategy_+_Delay_in_dRFP_Release_?= Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed on 8 July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at the Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was determined that this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business (SB)Set-Aside. The SB strategy under consideration will require offers to provide aggressive small business subcontracting participation in any proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the Acquisition Plan, we will consider up to two awards for consolidated Function Areas A, B, C and E under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best Value Source Selection decision). Area D may be made as a stand alone award or combined with an A-B-C-E award. Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that will be addressed in a tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be posted to PIXS in the next two weeks. The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days to late Sept 2005. Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP.  Release of the formal RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with proposals due early Jan 06. Award is contemplated late April 06. A new attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected schedule for this effort.  ********************************************************************** Update 8 July 2005: Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has been added to the library (scroll below). Questions were received during one on one interview sessions June 15, 2005.  ********************************************************************* Update: Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June 2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and current contractors working in SIMAF. A request was also received for contact information of companies participating in Industry Days. Both have been added to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions received during Industry Day and anticipate posting answers by 6 July 2005. ************************************************************* Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14 Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS library.  ********************************************************* Update:  Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun 05 During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the submittal of the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday June 17th will be extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions were asked about the SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple Functions QUESTION: Because the standard business practices, company past performance and responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR requirements/restrictions will be the same for all functional areas, would it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a cover letter with separate attachments; one containing the common company data and then attachments that address each functional area separately? ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions being proposed may be grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a package. Common or repeated information may be referred to from another function area SOC, however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will be acceptable, however. Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one page cover page that may contain business information and details like business size and CAGE code, etc. The cover page does not count towards the 5 pages per function. Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be acceptable to submit the SOC via email? ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is acceptable. Please allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC submittals to Patricia Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO will confirm receipt of the SOC. Availability of Industry Day Briefings QUESTION: Will the 14 June 05 XR-SIMAF Industry Day briefings be made available to industry via PIXS, or via a CD and when?

Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small  business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small business  participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition  has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been  coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business  Administration offices.  **********************************************************************  Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release  Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed  on 8 July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at  the Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was  determined that this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business  (SB)Set-Aside. The SB strategy under consideration will require offers to  provide aggressive small business subcontracting participation in any  proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the  Acquisition Plan, we will consider up to two awards for consolidated  Function Areas A, B, C and E under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best  Value Source Selection decision). Area D may be made as a stand alone  award or combined with an A-B-C-E award. Organizational Conflict of  Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that will be addressed in a  tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be posted to PIXS in the  next two weeks. The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days  to late Sept 2005. Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP.  Release of the formal RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with  proposals due early Jan 06. Award is contemplated late April 06. A new  attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort.  **********************************************************************  Update 8 July 2005: Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has  been added to the library (scroll below). Questions were received during  one on one interview sessions June 15, 2005.  *********************************************************************  Update: Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June  2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and  current contractors working in SIMAF. A request was also received for  contact information of companies participating in Industry Days. Both have  been added to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions  received during Industry Day and anticipate posting answers by 6 July  2005. *************************************************************  Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14  Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS library.  ********************************************************* Update:  Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun 05  During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the submittal  of the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday June 17th  will be extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions were asked  about the SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following infromation is  provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple Functions  QUESTION: Because the standard business practices, company past  performance and responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR  requirements/restrictions will be the same for all functional areas, would  it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a cover letter with separate  attachments; one containing the common company data and then attachments  that address each functional area separately? ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is  providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions being proposed may be  grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a package. Common  or repeated information may be referred to from another function area SOC,  however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will  be acceptable, however. Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one  page cover page that may contain business information and details like  business size and CAGE code, etc. The cover page does not count towards  the 5 pages per function. Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be  acceptable to submit the SOC via email? ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is  acceptable. Please allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low  band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC submittals to Patricia  Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO will confirm receipt  of the SOC.

Contracting Office Address:  Fleet & Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Suite 600, Code 40, 1968 Gilbert Street, Norfolk, VA  23511-3392

Description:  The Fleet & Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk is seeking information on Small Business sources that can provide services under the following proposed contract(Large Businesses do not respond please):
The proposed contract will facilitate work in direct support of the Navy Personnel Research Studies and Technology (NPRST) manpower, personnel, training and education research using web and wireless technologies, data and database technologies, and modeling and simulation enhancement and development.  Elements of web and wireless technology are widely used, but the use of these technologies in modeling and simulation, survey assessment, and performance posting is narrowly explored. These technologies will offer NPRST customers greater access to tools that are conducive to their mobile and expansive environment.  Also, data currency, availability, access, manipulation, linkage, use, security, storage, and maintenance are critical for conducting research and providing guidance to NPRST clients.  NPRST needs expertise to assist with eliminating hindrances with respect to model development, operation, testing, data mining and analysis, and trends assessments.  Finally, as the human resource enterprise seeks to become less stove-piped, the tools developed will require better integration, information delivery, and ease of use. While specific tasks will be outlined in task orders, generally these tasks will be related to: 1) web and wireless technologies for modeling and simulation access, survey implementation, and performance posting; 2) data base design, development, linkage, and maintenance; and 3) model development, evaluation, redesign, update, enhancements and integration, and maintenance.  The contract will expand research conducted in modeling and simulation, data and information access, and organizational assessment for manpower managers and analysts in such a way that it minimizes the technical requirements from the user.

<DESC>The Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) is a program dedicated to providing high quality, high throughput genotyping in support of efforts to locate and identify genes responsible for human disease. The identification of the locations of genes that predispose to or are responsible for a variety of human diseases will greatly benefit the programs of the National Institutes of Health. When the chromosomal localizations of genes contributing to such diseases are in hand, the genes likely to be involved can be identified and the functioning of their gene products in normal and disease states can be studied. New DNA-based diagnostic methods can be developed. Ultimately, identification of the genes can illuminate the biochemical and physiological pathways that have become deranged in these disorders and thus provide insights that may be crucial to developing both preventive and therapeutic interventions, thereby improving the public health. CIDR is a program established and supported by twelve NIH Institutes:  National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Eye Institute, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institute on Aging, National Institute of Deafness and other Communication Disorders, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the National Institute on Drug Abuse.  NHGRI provides the scientific and administrative oversight. The purpose of this acquisition is to provide high quality, high throughput human and mouse genotyping services and statistical genetics expertise dedicated towards finding the genetic basis for disease in support of extramural and intramural research programs supported by the twelve participating Institutes. Services to be provided include: (1) Short tandem repeat (STRP) genotyping to allow whole genome linkage scans of  at least 10,000 human samples per year at an average marker spacing of ~10 cM. (2) Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping using 6,000-10,000 uniformly spaced loci to allow SNP whole genome linkage scans of 24,000 human samples per year. (3) SNP genotyping of custom sets of between 380 and 3000 SNPs on 36,000 human DNA samples per year.  This genotyping needs to be done in a CLIA-approved manner if required by the investigator’s study design. (4) SNP genotyping of human MHC region with ~1200 or ~2400 SNPs. This genotyping needs to be done in a CLIA-approved manner if required by the investigator’s study design. (5) SNP genotyping of up to ~1500 SNPs in 2,000 mouse DNA samples per year. (6) SNP genotyping at 250,000 to 500,000 loci designed to capture >~80% of the variation in human DNA, when taking human linkage disequilibrium into account, for the purposes of genome-wide association studies. Genotyping for genome wide association studies must have a capacity of 10,000 samples in the first year, increasing to 20,000 samples in years 2-5. (7) Consultation on statistical genetics questions including power estimates for assessing sample size requirements before production genotyping is carried out, and analysis of genotyping data after production genotyping is complete. (8) Strict quality control to include testing of all samples for adequacy of amount and quality of DNA prior to full genotyping. Use of pedigree structure information to test for inheritance errors, misattributed parentage, and incorrect gender assignments, all of which might point to sample mix-ups. Opportunity for investigators who submit their projects to CIDR to replace problematic DNA samples that do not pass pre-testing quality control before production genotyping is undertaken. (9) Accurate quality control reports for each project and an annual summary over all projects on missing data, pedigree structure errors, and blind duplicate error rates, using either available software or designing and implementing novel software to generate these reports. (10) Databases for laboratory information management (tracking samples and reagent usage, DNA and reagent quality control), collecting genotyping results, and analyzing genotypes for data quality control metrics. (11) Ability to provide results on CD-ROM or removable hard disk media in a format mutually agreed upon by the CIDR Program and the submitting Investigator. (12) Data back-up in a secure location off-site that is specially designed to provide protection from physical damage to storage media. (13) Ability to receive and interpret electronically encoded family and pedigree structure information. (14) Capacity to receive >30,000 DNA samples per year from submitting investigators in multi-well, barcode encoded plates. Ability to aliquot, dilute, test, store and genotype these DNA samples without cross-contamination. (15) Expertise in evaluating and implementing novel genotyping technologies and work flow procedures in order to keep CIDR’s methodology up to date and cost effective. (16) Ability to provide SNP genotyping results in a CLIA approved manner upon request for clinical studies. Responses to this synopsis will be evaluated based on the following technical evaluation criteria which are listed in approximate descending order of importance: (1) Evidence of availability and skill of staff, including project management, to provide all of these services including sample and reagent handling, tracking  and reagent and sample quality control using a Laboratory Information Management system, high throughput production genotyping, analysis to provide data quality control assessments, statistical genetics expertise in study design and data analysis, and database management. (2) Evidence of ability to hire and retain senior staff with the necessary qualifications to import and/or implement highly technical genotyping methods, work flow procedures, to implement and apply state-of-the-art statistical genetics programs for study design and data analysis, and to import or create novel computer algorithms and programs in support of the goals of the CIDR Program. These qualifications are to include having academic appointments in a university or government-based organized research unit (Department, Branch, Institute or Center) specializing in genetics research. (3) Evidence of prior experience in providing the database support, data back-up, and data analysis required for linkage and association studies involving many thousands of samples and hundreds of thousands of loci. (4) Demonstrated prior experience in high throughput genotyping of DNA samples at a rate of >24,000 samples per year. (5) Demonstrated ability to provide SNP genotyping service on at least two different platforms, with SNP sets ranging in size from a few hundred SNPs to >~250,000 SNPs genotyped per sample. Ability to provide SNP genotyping results on up to 3,000 SNPs per sample in a CLIA approved manner, when requested by the submitting investigator. (6) Demonstrated ability to perform genome-wide STRP genotyping at ~10 cM interval in a highly multiplexed, cost-efficient manner. Johns Hopkins University has been providing these services under a noncompetitive contract since the CIDR program was created in 1996. The NHLBI, on behalf of NHGRI, intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Johns Hopkins University for a five year contract to continue to provide these services. This synopsis is intended to test the market to determine if our planned non-competitive award to Johns Hopkins University should be done competitively instead; there is no solicitation at this time. Responses are due at the following address not later than December 16, 2005: National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6138, Bethesda, MD  20892-7902 (use 20817 for express mail) Attention: Lynn M.

1.0	DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
1.1	Introduction
The ABL test program requires access to various test targets to characterize, verify, or demonstrate inherent weapon system capabilities such as target acquisition, tracking and pointing.  These tests will be accomplished, over the course of the next four years, at various test ranges, to include White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), Edwards AFB Range Complex, and the Western Test Range (WTR).  The Proteus aircraft is a manned twin turbofan high altitude multi mission aircraft powered by Williams International FJ44-2E engines leased and operated by Scaled Composites, LLC, Mojave, CA (California).  The aircraft is designed to support long duration high altitude operations carrying a variety of “customer specific” payloads.  Specifically, it is designed to carry payloads in the 2000-pound class to altitudes above 60,000 feet and remain on station up to 14 hours The ABL program office has selected the Proteus aircraft to carry the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)/Lincoln Lab (LL) target board in support of the ABL test program requirements.  

Furthermore, this document contains an overview of those requirements. It is important to note that the specific ABL payload, the Proteus Target Board System (PTBS), which will be carried by Proteus, is the responsibility of the MIT/LL.  MIT/LL is responsible for the target board design, fabrication, integration, and characterization as required to support ABL program requirements.  

The target board carrier was designed and fabricated by Scaled Composites, LLC, Mojave, CA.  It is a one of a kind target board carrier specifically designed to be carried on the one and only Proteus aircraft also operated by Scaled Composites.  

For the purpose of this contract, ABL will only be procuring flight hours and support required to support flight tests.  Mounting of the PTBS and PTBS support will not be covered in this contract but maintained through existing and future contracts between Scaled Composites and MIT/LL.
1.2	Scope
Scaled Composites is required to provide captive carry support of the MIT/LL PTBS and associated subsystems as required to collect ABL specific data.  Additionally, Scaled Composites is required to provide transportation support services of the PTBS to and from various locations as required to support the ABL program.
 
1.3	Personnel Requirements
Contractor personnel must have prior and unique detailed knowledge of the PTBS.  
1.4	Data Analysis
The contractor will not have access to any data that is retrieved from the flight test.  Only the ABL/ITF, MIT, ABL System Program Office (SPO), or other designated government agencies/organizations will have access and be able to download or retrieve any data. MIT/LL will continue to perform data analysis collection through their existing contract.  

1.4.1.1	 There shall be no classified or sensitive data processed at the contractor facility under this contract.
1.5	Technical Requirements
The following section describes required technical requirements. These requirements may be satisfied by the contractor in one or more of the following task areas:

a)	Provide aircraft flying hours for Proteus Target Board System (PTBS) through an all inclusive flying hour cost. 
b)	Participate in the Test Planning Working Group (ABL/ITF engagement scenarios), technical and safety reviews, pre/post mission briefings, and mission planning activities as directed by ABL/ITF.
c)	Provide flying hours to ferry PTBS to and from locations supporting flight tests and target board maintenance.
d)	Functionally check/calibrate the applicable instrumentation prior to commencing ground and flight test.

1.6	Program Management
The contractor shall designate a Project Manager (PM) responsible for all contract efforts.  This person shall be the primary point of contact for programmatic issues.  The contractor shall designate an alternate PM designated to act on behalf of the PM during absences.

The contractor PM will issue monthly management progress reports to ABL/ITF PM summarizing the status of the PTBS and each major function/task, including the actual cost and schedule.  
2.0	CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT (CM) AND QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA)
The contractor shall provide CM and QA functions in the performance of this contract.  
3.0	TRAVEL
The government will pay for travel costs associated with Proteus aircraft deployments. Cost will not exceed max per diem rate for lodging and food as stated by GSA (www.gsa.gov).  Personnel traveling from Scaled Composites will stay in government approved facilities.  Travel will include 2 rental cars per deployment and air fare for Scaled Composite personnel.  The contractor will be responsible for any costs outside the max per diem rate.
4.0	BASE SUPPORT AT DEPLOYED LOCATIONS
Base support services are already being covered in the contract between Electronic Systems Center and MIT/LL/Scaled Composites.  The current support given will remain contracted as such. Neither the SPO, nor ABL/ITF will contract or pay for these services.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for Market Research for the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) Office of System Accountability.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. 
As a civilian agency of the U.S. Department of Defense, DoDEA serves the educational needs of the dependents of military and civilian employees by providing PK-12 instruction to over 90,000 students in seven states, 13 foreign countries, Guam, and Puerto Rico.  DoDEA’s curriculum, resources, and student achievement scores on standardized assessments compare favorably to high-performing US public schools. 
DoDEA is beginning a K-12 foreign language initiative, which will make foreign language a required subject in grades K-12.  The goal is to graduate students at the Pre-Advanced or Advanced level of proficiency.  The purpose of this Sources Sought is to identify sources for DoDEA’s FLES Spanish initiative, which is a key component of the larger foreign language initiative.   
DoDEA is asking companies to provide information about published copyrighted instructional materials, software, technical support (if applicable) and professional development for the K-6 level.  These materials are those consistent with curriculum purchases, that is, such materials as student textbooks, student workbooks, teacher editions, teacher resource materials, assessment materials, and digital courseware such as online, CD-ROM, downloadable material, audio-cassette tapes, or DVDS, integral to the implementation of the textbook.  It is a critical element that the Low Novice materials be suitable for use by teachers who are proficient in speaking Spanish but may not necessarily possess native fluency.
DoDEA also needs to know the breakdown of the “modules” offered; e.g., they may be K-1, 2-3, 4-5, and 6 or K-2, 3-5, and 6 or K-2, 3-6.  Although materials from several vendors may be needed to meet the Government’s requirements, responses to the Sources Sought Notice shall include advice on the feasibility of having one Company provide the whole gamut of K-6 materials and professional development and of having one Company meet the timeline requirements outlined in the attached SOW.    
The estimated quantity of instructional materials required during the base period and option years is shown below.  These figures do not guarantee or confirm any actual order.  As stated, no solicitation exists at this time.  

The attached Statement of Work (SOW) has additional details of interest.  The SOW will be modified based on the information gleaned from this request. 

This is a Sources Sought Notice for MARKET RESEARCH ONLY.
No Final Solicitation Documents Exist At This Time.
Responses shall include a description of the respondent’s past experience and capabilities in successfully performing this type of contract, including a description of the contract, name and phone number of the point of contact at the purchasing organization.  Responses shall include the Company name, point of contact, email address, telephone and facsimile numbers, type and business size.  A Draft Statement of Work will be uploaded to provide further details.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY MEMS CONTACT STRESS SENSOR
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
MEMS CONTACT STRESS SENSOR

Opportunity:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license and commercially develop a flexible, extensible contact sensor for use in a variety of commercial applications.

Background: This technology addresses a long understood need for contact stress sensing across a large variety of applications.  At present there are no adequate products to solve the need for repeated, dynamic measurements on a two-axis curvature.  By capitalizing on micromachining technology, pressure sensing techniques are scaled to assess contact stress in a device 50 microns thick.  The flexibility of LLNL’s MEMS contact stress sensor allows it to conform to complex curvatures, while the small form factor means there is no extra pressure caused by the device.

Description:  The LLNL MEMS Contact Stress Sensor can be a single unit or a flexible array of sensors that measures mechanical or solid pressure. A large variety of load ranges can be easily accommodated by dimensioning of the MEMS sensing diaphragm.  Single silicon sensors (for point measurements), and sensor arrays, can be 50 um thick or 125 um total thickness, including the package.  While a single sensor measures loads (stress) perpendicular to the surface of contact, a sensor array can flex and stretch, allowing conformity to any curvature (i.e. a human hip joint) greater than 5mm.     

Advantages:
·	Re-useable and stable (does not wear out), can be used as a component in a commercial product
·	Minimally intrusive: very thin, does not alter stress being measured
·	Arrays are flexible and extensible for wide application
·	Flexible design for various load ranges
·	Proven silicon performance; highly elastic, useful for high-speed (dynamic) measurements

Potential Applications:  Our technology is designed for any application that includes two contacting surfaces with a need to measure pressure of interfacing loads.  Promising applications include:  brake pads; in-situ tire monitoring; gaskets and seals; artificial joints; podiatry (foot pressure); seating, bedding, and prosthetics; tumor monitoring; robotics and haptic devices; injection molding; and impact studies.                  

Development Status:  A Patent Application has been filed.  DOE is currently producing and using prototype sensors internally. Please see additional information on the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/announcement/MEMS_ContactStressSensor.php

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.

<SUBJECT>--Collaborative Technology Alliance on Advance Microsystems Initiative
<DESC>The US Army is currently involved in preliminary discussions on a new Collaborative Technology Alliance on Advanced Microsystems.  The Army envisions this alliance will bring together government, industrial, and academic institutions to address some of the fundamental scientific and technological underpinnings to enable the deployment of microsystems, such as micro air vehicles, micro ground vehicles, and unattended ground sensors, on the battlefield.  Fundamental research is sought in microsystems integration, integrated processing, microbionic aeromechanics and ambulation, miniature powe r and energy generation, and microelectronics. As part of this collaborative alliance, the Army intends to reach out to and engage with non- traditional government contractors.  Contingent upon available funding, the Army expects to support the alliance for five years with an option for an additional five years at greater than $10M per year.  The US Army expects to hold an open workshop in earl y calendar year 2006 to explore scientific opportunities in microsystems.  The Army further expects to invite interested consortia of industry and academia to submit proposals in connection with the program around the second quarter of calendar year 2006.  This announcement makes interested organizations aware of this upcoming initiative.

This project will support the NCI LPG which is engaged in a number of studies involving correlation of genotype variations in candidate genes in pathways related to cancer susceptibility, disease, and/or response to treatment.    The Government requires the determination of genotypes from DNA isolated from a variety of clinical samples.  These genotypes must be determined using a highly accurate state of the art technology that requires a minimum amount of DNA sample.  This technology must be a proven technology with references of successful (at least 95% efficiency rate) large-scale projects (more than 1000 samples processed per project) in a peer-reviewed journal.   Key aspects of any large-scale genotyping study are the quality and quantity of DNA required to obtain accurate, reliable, and complete results.  The genotyping assay(s) must be robust over a range of DNA concentrations and quality.  In prior experience, some specific marker assays require different genotyping technologies from others to achieve the required accuracy.  For these studies, it is required that the assay(s) be able to generate accurate data from 3 nanograms or less of DNA per assay and have a proven reliability for large scale genotyping studies.  The Government is interested in assays with the ability to multiplex at the reaction level to further minimize the required amount of sample DNA, and  interested in proven technologies involving Whole Genome Amplification.  The Government also requires the data be reported in an electronic file format and have a reportable quality parameter associated with each genotype call.

Statement of Work

Train Network Management System Development-- Technical Support for Demonstrations of Locomotive Emergency Egress, Locomotive Security System and Advanced Concept Train


Overview of Train Demonstrations— Locomotive Emergency Egress, Advanced Concept Train and Locomotive Security System

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Office of Research and Development proposes to build a five-car train to demonstrate new freight car technology systems that FRA has been developing during the past several years. The demonstration covers three areas from three separate program areas—Rolling Stock and Equipment, Train Occupant Protection and Train Security.  FRA has developed Emergency Egress concepts for locomotives. The roof hatch, removable windshield, detachable door hinge and the Automatic Collision Notification System were developed under the Train Occupant Protection Program to improve locomotive crew safety.  FRA proposes to demonstrate these concepts as part of the demonstrations.  The objective of the Advanced Concept Train (ACT) Project is to develop and demonstrate advanced systems for continuously monitoring and remotely controlling freight car mechanical components to improve freight rail transportation safety and efficiency. This includes the use of Electrically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) Braking.  The program is part of the Rolling Stock Program Element in FRA's Five-Year Strategic Plan for Railroad Research, Development and Demonstrations.  The Locomotive Security System (LSS) is part of the Train Security Program.  The objective of the LSS is to develop and demonstrate advanced concepts to prevent unauthorized operation of locomotives.

During FY 2003 FRA purchased an EMD GP40-3 EM2000 computer controlled locomotive for these projects.   FRA proposes to acquire five freight cars on loan from co-operating railroads for the Advanced Concept Train Demonstration projects. The five freight cars will be equipped with sensors to monitor the following components:

·	Bearings (vibration signature and temperature)
·	Trucks (ride quality and hunting)
·	Wheels (flat and out-of-round)
·	Brakes (piston travel)
·	Car Ride Quality (all three directions)

The freight cars will also be equipped with actuators to remotely control the following components:

·	Coupler
·	Cut-levers
·	Angle-cocks
·	Advanced cushioning device
·	Advanced handbrake

The FRA also plans to equip the ACT locomotive and freight cars with stand alone hard-wired AAR S-4200 compliant Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) brakes.  FRA purchased New York Air Brake’s EP-60 ECP brakes along with locomotive CCB-II brakes to control braking. FRA also plans to upgrade the locomotive to provide locomotive systems for on-board monitoring for safe and efficient maintenance and operation. The ACT locomotive (GP-40-3) will be modified to incorporate a Locomotive Security System (LSS).

An IEEE 802-11b based two-way wireless intra-train communication system will link the freight cars to the locomotive. The communication system enables the freight cars to transmit safety alarms and status information to the locomotive and to receive commands and information requests from the locomotive. When a defect affecting train safety is detected, a safety alarm will be sent to the locomotive to alert the engineer.  Non-critical defects detected during normal operations are flagged and reported for maintenance. The freight car sensor data will also be linked to a remote database server through a wireless telecommunications system.  The database server will be accessible via the Internet.  FRA currently has five cars equipped with the on-board monitoring system operating in a revenue service demonstration in co-operation with Southern Company and Norfolk Southern Corporation.  The experience gained with that demonstration will be extended to the ACT.

Integrating Locomotive Display/Computer Systems with ECP Braking and the ACT Monitoring and Control System

FRA has reviewed available locomotive computer systems for use in the ACT Demonstration Project. The FRA GP-40-3 locomotive is an Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) built locomotive with the EM-2000 computer. The EMD Functionally Integrated Railway Electronics (FIRE) locomotive display and cab computer with integrated Communications Management Unit (CMU) and IntelliTrain remote monitoring system is uniquely qualified to support the FRA ACT project.  The FIRE locomotive display and cab computer is built on a Microsoft Windows embedded XP platform and is designed to operate in the locomotive cab environment.  The FIRE computer uses an EMD proprietary inter-process communication protocol known as NetCore, which is based on a TCP/IP network socket bus architecture.  The FIRE computer CMU supports numerous wireless communications technologies, including 1xRTT and GPRS packet switched cellular, CDMA circuit switched cellular, and 802.11b wireless LAN.  The FIRE computer integrated CMU and NetCore messaging protocol is employed to seamlessly exchange data between the locomotive and remote databases.  EMD has created a FIRE Developer’s Kit (FDK) that provides a set of tools to support development of third party applications for the FIRE locomotive display and cab computer. The FDK will facilitate development of software for the ACT demonstration.

In view of the above FRA is seeking a contractor to support the ACT development team in developing the necessary software and to provide related technical support to install the software on the locomotive FIRE computers installed on the FRA GP-40-3 locomotive. The required software and its function for each of the specific tasks are described in detail below:

TASKS

Task 1: Train Network Management System Development for Actuator Remote Control and On-Board Sensor Monitoring

a) Messaging Protocol Development for communication between the freight cars and the locomotive FIRE computer and locomotive applications 

The contractor shall support the ACT development team in developing a messaging system for two-way communication between the locomotive and the freight cars and between the locomotive and remote database servers.  The messaging system will be based on an open protocol such as Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS).  The messaging system software shall run on the FIRE computer to support operation of various graphical user interfaces for controlling advanced components and displaying monitoring system data and two-way messaging between the locomotive and the ACT freight cars.
b) Graphical User Interfaces on Locomotive FIRE computers

Task 2:  Locomotive Security System

In recent times there has been a heightened concern about railroad security in the US.  One area of particular concern is the vulnerability of locomotives and trains to operation by unauthorized individuals and the potential use of a train as a terrorist weapon.  It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to stop a loaded train carrying hazardous material, going 70 MPH, in a populated urban area by any means other than by derailing it.  At the very least, this would result in significant property damage and be extremely disruptive to America’s railroad transportation system. FRA, has identified the risk of using a locomotive/train as a terrorist weapon and the unique challenge faced by the railroads to secure their locomotives and infrastructure.

Because many different personnel operate locomotives and they are often interchanged between railroads, locomotives are not equipped with an ignition key like an automobile.  Instead, locomotives are equipped with a universal removable "Reverser" handle that is mechanically interlocked with the locomotive "Throttle" handle.  The "Reverser" handle is inserted into a slot in the locomotive controller mechanism in order to operate the locomotive. Because the "Reverser" handle is designed to be interchangeable between locomotives, a lost, misplaced, stolen or duplicated "Reverser" handle could be used by an unauthorized individual to operate any standard freight or passenger locomotive in North America.  Locomotive cabs are also equipped with door locks, however they are seldom used, especially when the locomotives are being operated.  In any case, they would provide little protection against an armed terrorist determined to hijack a locomotive.

To address these security risks and prevent unauthorized operation of locomotives, FRA would like to develop and demonstrate a Locomotive Security System.  The system, as envisioned, would utilize electronic ID technology, such as SmartCards, to authenticate the identity of a certified locomotive engineer/operator.  If the operator fails to authenticate properly, a full service penalty brake would be initiated by the LSS to stop the train and prevent operation of the locomotive The contractor shall develop a prototype system for application to the FRA Advanced Concept Train Locomotive. The contractor shall provide technical support to install, test and verify operation of the LSS. 

Locomotive Security System Concept

The LSS, as envisioned, would use an electronic ID (e.g. smartcard) to prevent unauthorized operation of a locomotive.  In the basic embodiment of the system, authorized locomotive operators would be issued an electronic ID and their own unique PIN.  The PIN is encrypted so that the ID card can not be duplicated if lost or stolen.  The locomotive would be equipped with an electronic ID card reader and keypad.  The electronic ID card readerwould interface to the LSS computer.  The LSS computer would  prevent operation of the locomotive unless a valid PIN is entered by the locomotive operator. A functional discussion follows.

Each time the locomotive comes to a stop, the locomotive operator must enter his PIN before the LSS computer will allow the locomotive to be operated.  While the locomotive is moving, the locomotive operator must periodically enter his PIN.  If the locomotive operator fails to enter the correct PIN, the LSS computer will send a signal to the locomotive airbrake system to initiate a penalty brake application.  A penalty brake application will result in removal of locomotive traction power and the reduction of brake pipe pressure to zero psi at a service rate.  

An optional distress message can automatically be transmitted to alert authorities of unauthorized locomotive operation when an incorrect PIN is entered or when a special PIN is entered (e.g. backward PIN).

In another embodiment of this invention, operator biometric information (e.g. fingerprint) is stored on the electronic ID.  The locomotive is equipped with an electronic ID card reader and corresponding biometric scanner (e.g. fingerprint reader).  The operation is identical to that described above using a PIN to authenticate locomotive operation except that a biometric scan is conducted instead of a PIN being entered by the operator. Periodic reaffirmation can be incorporated with the ALERTER system. The handle may be equipped with a fingerprint scanner which will allow the locomotive engineer/operator continuing authentication. 

As part of this work, the FRA GP40-3 locomotive shall be equipped with an Electro-Motive FIRE™ Locomotive Cab Computer and Display (LCC&D).  FRA proposes to further utilize this locomotive to implement a prototype LSS with capabilities to use either a PIN or a fingerprint for operator authentication.

The proposed locomotive security system shall use an electronic ID card that contains the operator’s encrypted personal identification number (PIN) and fingerprint information.  The locomotive security system shall be integrated with the brake system.  The locomotive will be equipped with both an electronic ID card reader and a finger print scanner.  The FIRE™ computer shall be used to implement the LSS algorithms and for operator PIN input.  

The operator must insert his/her ID card into the electronic ID card reader and input his/her PIN, or place his/her index finger on the fingerprint scanner, before operating the locomotive.  If the operator does not enter the correct PIN, or the fingerprint authentication fails, the locomotive security system will initiate a full service penalty brake application.  During operation of the locomotive, the operator will be asked to periodically enter his/her PIN into the system or place their finger on the fingerprint scanner in order to prevent a penalty brake application from being activated by the LSS.

A task report describing the Locomotive Security System shall be prepared and delivered to FRA for review and comment. This report shall be revised and submitted for final distribution. The prototype hardware shall be delivered for installation and support provided for installation of the same.

           			     ASSEMBLY
I have determined, that negotiations shall be conducted only with NW PROPELLER OPERATIONS, INC., the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), or their authorized distributor under statutory authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

The CONTROL, VALVE ASSEMBLY is a proprietary item of the proposed contractor. The reproduction manufacturing drawings, specifications and other technical data have not been purchased. NW PROPELLER OPERATION, INC, is the only contractor that can guarantee interchangeability and standardization of the CONTROL, VALVE ASSEMBLY. The Coast Guard did not purchase the rights to the technical data when the CONTROL, VALVE ASSEMBLY were purchased.

 The CONTROL, VALVE ASSEMBLY is a component that is used on the PROPULSION SYSTEM  and for main propulsion system the replacement must have the exact design characteristics The CONTROL, VALVE ASSEMBLY must be of original size, location and configuration in order to fit a location without modification of the CONTROL, VALVE ASSEMBLY. The Engineering Logistics Center stocks repair parts for the installed CONTROL VALVE  ASSEMBLY, and 270 FT. WMEC  carry allowance repair parts onboard that would not be compatible with a CONTROL, VALVE ASSEMBLY of another manufacturer. The purchase of a CONTROL, VALVE ASSEMBLY of another manufacturer would necessitate the preparation of a new ALLOWANCE PARTS LIST and eliminate fleet standardization.

However, other potential sources desiring to furnish other than NORTHWEST PROPELLER OPERATIONS INC parts are required to submit the following information:  1) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e. salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics) or 2) Data that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufactured for the government or the original equipment manufacturer.

This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-06.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is 532490. The size standard for a small business under this NAICS code is one that is equal to or less than $6,000,000. This Request for Quotation is being submitted as a restricted solicitation open to small businesses. This is a commercial purchase.  CLIN 0001 – 2 ea – Lease of Generators, Must be able to use Bio-Diesel, Period 1 Dec 05-15 May 06.  Requirement:  The basic requirement is to provide a safe, reliable, temporary solution to the power shortfall in the CAOC-N bullpen for JEFX 06 using generators.  This shortfall equates to approximately 1478 Amps for Spiral 2 and 2338 Amps for Spiral 3 and MainEx (dates below, see Tables 1 and 2 for power requirements summary).  The desire is to implement a generator and distribution system for Spiral 2 that will also service the requirements for Spiral 3 and MainEx, since the additional activity directed for JEFX 06 drives essentially continuous operations from 1 Dec 2005 through 15 May 2006. The overall desire is to minimize the number of small generators required due to space limitations and to mitigate the care/feeding required of a generator “farm” by using a single “power plant” to service the bullpen’s tactical power requirements.  The power provided shall be of an “uninterruptible” nature to maximum extent possible.  Solutions which involve tandem generators with a delay in the backup generator assuming the load are not acceptable.  For example, a solution in which a backup generator senses the primary has dropped the load and it cranks up and assumes the load within 10 seconds is unacceptable, as some users in the bullpen will lose their systems.  A solution with two generators constantly running and sharing the load, with the capability for one to assume the entire load almost instantaneously, should one fail, would be acceptable. The requirement also includes a system to distribute power to the various user requirements outlined in the tables below and depicted in the bullpen diagrams for Spiral 2 (Attachment 1) and Spiral 3/MainEx (Attachment 2) as well as connecting the distribution system to each trailer/system in the bullpen.  The supplier needs to devise, provide, install, and remove the distribution system and generators.  Note that Trailer #4 will be on commercial power so it will not be included in the generator power distribution system.  Due to the security and basic coordination challenges involved with fuel truck deliveries from off-base sources over the 6-month period to support this requirement, the government will provide fuel for, and re-fuel the generators during operations using B20 bio-diesel.  The specifications on Air Force B20 bio-diesel fuel are outlined in Attachment 3.  The solution should include a fuel tank of sufficient size to provide a run-time of approximately 48 hours under constant load between re-fueling.  Additionally, the contractor shall provide a trouble call number that JEFX personnel can call (24 hours a day 7 days a week) to report problems.  The contractor shall respond to all trouble calls (24 hours a day 7 days a week) with a return phone call (“follow-up call”) to JEFX designated representative(s) (name(s) and phone number(s) to be provided after award) within 10 minutes of a trouble call.  If so required, the contractor will have technicians, mechanics and/or electricians on-site within 45 minutes of the follow-up call.  It is expected that the contractor will train qualified JEFX power pro personnel in the procedures to start and stop the generator(s) so that the contractor does not have to have an operator on site each day for routine starting and stopping of the generator.  However, this does not alleviate the contractor from sending out a mechanic to perform oil checks and routine inspections as required by the generator’s manufacturer.  Additionally, the contractor will work with JEFX personnel to schedule routine PMIs (such as oil changes) so that it does not effect JEFX operations, i.e., JEFX expects such activities to occur outside it’s operational windows and expects the contractor to schedule such activities accordingly.  The contractor will request PMI time at least 2 days prior to need date.Electrical Distribution System Requirement.  The contractor will install an electrical distribution system to distribute generator power as required to meet the tactical power needs outlined for each item in the Spiral 2 and Spiral 3/MainEx Bullpen diagrams and power requirement tables (Tables 1 and 2, Attachments 1 and 2).  All components of the distribution system will be sunlight resistant (where exposed to direct sunlight) and will use weatherproof connectors, distribution boxes, splices, etc as required.  Additionally, all circuits, circuit breakers, panels, and cutoffs will be adequately marked.  The distribution system will have the ability to isolate each item requiring power in the bullpen to allow work on each item without removing power from remaining items.  The contractor will install a grounding system that meets all NEC 2005, Article 250 and 550 requirements.  The contractor will also comply with the Nellis AFB and 99CES digging permit process prior to installing any grounding rods.Dates Required:  The solution needs to be in-place on 1 Dec 05.  For Spiral 2, power is required 14 hours per day during the period 1 Dec 05 to 9 Jan 06, 24 hours per day during the period 9 – 20 Jan 06, and 14 hours per day during the period 21-31 Jan 06.For Spiral 3, power is required 14 hours per day during the period 3 – 28 Feb 06, 24 hours/day during the period 1-10 Mar 06, and 14 hours per day during the period 11-23 Mar 06. For MainEx, power is required 14 hours/day during the period 27 Mar – 17 Apr 06, 24 hours/day during the period 18 – 28 Apr 06, and 14 hours/day during the period 29 Apr – 15 May 06.

Statement of Work

Train Network Management System Development-- Technical Support for Demonstrations of Locomotive Emergency Egress, Locomotive Security System and Advanced Concept Train


Overview of Train Demonstrations— Locomotive Emergency Egress, Advanced Concept Train and Locomotive Security System

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Office of Research and Development proposes to build a five-car train to demonstrate new freight car technology systems that FRA has been developing during the past several years. The demonstration covers three areas from three separate program areas—Rolling Stock and Equipment, Train Occupant Protection and Train Security.  FRA has developed Emergency Egress concepts for locomotives. The roof hatch, removable windshield, detachable door hinge and the Automatic Collision Notification System were developed under the Train Occupant Protection Program to improve locomotive crew safety.  FRA proposes to demonstrate these concepts as part of the demonstrations.  The objective of the Advanced Concept Train (ACT) Project is to dring and remotely controlling freight car mechanical components to improve freight rail transportation safety and efficiency. This includes the use of Electrically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) Braking.  The program is part of the Rolling Stock Program Element in FRA's Five-Year Strategic Plan for Railroad Research, Development and Demonstrations.  The Locomotive Security System (LSS) is part of the Train Security Program.  The objective of the LSS is to develop and demonstrate advanced concepts to prevent unauthorized operation of locomotives.

During FY 2003 FRA purchased an EMD GP40-3 EM2000 computer controlled locomotive for these projects.   FRA proposes to acquire five freight cars on loan from co-operating railroads for the Advanced Concept Train Demonstration projects. The five freight cars will be equipped with sensors to monitor the following components:

·	Bearings (vibration signature and temperature)
·	Trucks (ride quality and hunting)
·	Wheels (flat and out-of-round)
·	Brakes (piston travel)
·	Car Ride Quality (all three directions)

The freight cars will also be equipped with actuators to remotely control the following components:

·	Coupler
·	Cut-levers
·	Angle-cocks
·	Advanced cushioning device
·	Advanced handbrake

The FRA also plans to equip the ACT locomotive and freight cars with stand alone hard-wired AAR S-4200 compliant Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) brakes.  FRA purchased New York Air Brake’s EP-60 ECP brakes along with locomotive CCB-II brakes to control braking. FRA also plans to upgrade the locomotive to provide locomotive systems for on-board monitoring for safe and efficient maintenance and operation. The ACT locomotive (GP-40-3) will be modified to incorporate a Locomotive Security System (LSS).

An IEEE 802-11b based two-way wireless intra-train communication system will link the freight cars to the locomotive. The communication system enables the freight cars to transmit safety alarms and status information to the locomotive and to receive commands and information requests from the locomotive. When a defect affecting train safety is detected, a safety alarm will be sent to the locomotive to alert the engineer.  Non-critical defects detected during normal operations are flagged and reported for maintenance. The freight car sensor data will also be linked to a remote database server through a wireless telecommunications system.  The database server will be accessible via the Internet.  FRA currently has five cars equipped with the on-board monitoring system operating in a revenue service demonstration in co-operation with Southern Company and Norfolk Southern Corporation.  The experience gained with that demonstration will be extended to the ACT.

Integrating Locomotive Display/Computer Systems with ECP Braking and the ACT Monitoring and Control System

FRA has reviewed available locomotive computer systems for use in the ACT Demonstration Project. The FRA GP-40-3 locomotive is an Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) built locomotive with the EM-2000 computer. The EMD Functionally Integrated Railway Electronics (FIRE) locomotive display and cab computer with integrated Communications Management Unit (CMU) and IntelliTrain remote monitoring system is uniquely qualified to support the FRA ACT project.  The FIRE locomotive display and cab computer is built on a Microsoft Windows embedded XP platform and is designed to operate in the locomotive cab environment.  The FIRE computer uses an EMD proprietary inter-process communication protocol known as NetCore, which is based on a TCP/IP network socket bus architecture.  The FIRE computer CMU supports numerous wireless communications technologies, including 1xRTT and GPRS packet switched cellular, CDMA circuit switched cellular, and 802.11b wireless LAN.  The FIRE computer integrated CMU and NetCore messaging protocol is employed to seamlessly exchange data between the locomotive and remote databases.  EMD has created a FIRE Developer’s Kit (FDK) that provides a set of tools to support development of third party applications for the FIRE locomotive display and cab computer. The FDK will facilitate development of software for the ACT demonstration.

In view of the above FRA is seeking a contractor to support the ACT development team in developing the necessary software and to provide related technical support to install the software on the locomotive FIRE computers installed on the FRA GP-40-3 locomotive. The required software and its function for each of the specific tasks are described in detail below:

TASKS

Task 1: Train Network Management System Development for Actuator Remote Control and On-Board Sensor Monitoring

a) Messaging Protocol Development for communication between the freight cars and the locomotive FIRE computer and locomotive applications 

The contractor shall support the ACT development team in developing a messaging system for two-way communication between the locomotive and the freight cars and between the locomotive and remote database servers.  The messaging system will be based on an open protocol such as Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS).  The messaging system software shall run on the FIRE computer to support operation of various graphical user interfaces for controlling advanced components and displaying monitoring system data and two-way messaging between the locomotive and the ACT freight cars.
b) Graphical User Interfaces on Locomotive FIRE computers
The contractor shall support the ACT development team in developing graphical user interfaces (GUI) on the FIRE computer to control the advanced components (hand brakes, cut levers, angle cocks, etc.) and display information from the passive monitoring system.
c) Transmitting OBMCS (sensor) data to web accessible database server
The contractor shall develop software for the locomotive FIRE computers to transmit car sensor data and pertinent locomotive data (locomotive health status, fuel data, asset tracking) to a web accessible database server when required. The On-Board Monitoring and Control System also provides a direct path to the web accessible database server.  The software shall use the messaging system developed in a).
d) ACT Hazard Analysis
The contractor shall provide engineering technical support to assist with conducting a hazard analysis of the ACT system, particularly the intra-train wireless communication system between the locomotive and the ACT freight cars.  A report describing the Hazard Analysis shall be written and submitted to the FRA.

Task 2:  Locomotive Security System

In recent times there has been a heightened concern about railroad security in the US.  One area of particular concern is the vulnerability of locomotives and trains to operation by unauthorized individuals and the potential use of a train as a terrorist weapon.  It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to stop a loaded train carrying hazardous material, going 70 MPH, in a populated urban area by any means other than by derailing it.  At the very least, this would result in significant property damage and be extremely disruptive to America’s railroad transportation system. FRA, has identified the risk of using a locomotive/train as a terrorist weapon and the unique challenge faced by the railroads to secure their locomotives and infrastructure.

Because many different personnel operate locomotives and they are often interchanged between railroads, locomotives are not equipped with an ignition key like an automobile.  Instead, locomotives are equipped with a universal removable "Reverser" handle that is mechanically interlocked with the locomotive "Throttle" handle.  The "Reverser" handle is inserted into a slot in the locomotive controller mechanism in order to operate the locomotive. Because the "Reverser" handle is designed to be interchangeable between locomotives, a lost, misplaced, stolen or duplicated "Reverser" handle could be used by an unauthorized individual to operate any standard freight or passenger locomotive in North America.  Locomotive cabs are also equipped with door locks, however they are seldom used, especially when the locomotives are being operated.  In any case, they would provide little protection against an armed terrorist determined to hijack a locomotive.

To address these security risks and prevent unauthorized operation of locomotives, FRA would like to develop and demonstrate a Locomotive Security System.  The system, as envisioned, would utilize electronic ID technology, such as SmartCards, to authenticate the identity of a certified locomotive engineer/operator.  If the operator fails to authenticate properly, a full service penalty brake would be initiated by the LSS to stop the train and prevent operation of the locomotive The contractor shall develop a prototype system for application to the FRA Advanced Concept Train Locomotive. The contractor shall provide technical support to install, test and verify operation of the LSS. 

Locomotive Security System Concept

The LSS, as envisioned, would use an electronic ID (e.g. smartcard) to prevent unauthorized operation of a locomotive.  In the basic embodiment of the system, authorized locomotive operators would be issued an electronic ID and their own unique PIN.  The PIN is encrypted so that the ID card can not be duplicated if lost or stolen.  The locomotive would be equipped with an electronic ID card reader and keypad.  The electronic ID card readerwould interface to the LSS computer.  The LSS computer would  prevent operation of the locomotive unless a valid PIN is entered by the locomotive operator. A functional discussion follows.

Each time the locomotive comes to a stop, the locomotive operator must enter his PIN before the LSS computer will allow the locomotive to be operated.  While the locomotive is moving, the locomotive operator must periodically enter his PIN.  If the locomotive operator fails to enter the correct PIN, the LSS computer will send a signal to the locomotive airbrake system to initiate a penalty brake application.  A penalty brake application will result in removal of locomotive traction power and the reduction of brake pipe pressure to zero psi at a service rate.  

An optional distress message can automatically be transmitted to alert authorities of unauthorized locomotive operation when an incorrect PIN is entered or when a special PIN is entered (e.g. backward PIN).

In another embodiment of this invention, operator biometric information (e.g. fingerprint) is stored on the electronic ID.  The locomotive is equipped with an electronic ID card reader and corresponding biometric scanner (e.g. fingerprint reader).  The operation is identical to that described above using a PIN to authenticate locomotive operation except that a biometric scan is conducted instead of a PIN being entered by the operator. Periodic reaffirmation can be incorporated with the ALERTER system. The handle may be equipped with a fingerprint scanner which will allow the locomotive engineer/operator continuing authentication. 

As part of this work, the FRA GP40-3 locomotive shall be equipped with an Electro-Motive FIRE™ Locomotive Cab Computer and Display (LCC&D).  FRA proposes to further utilize this locomotive to implement a prototype LSS with capabilities to use either a PIN or a fingerprint for operator authentication.

The proposed locomotive security system shall use an electronic ID card that contains the operator’s encrypted personal identification number (PIN) and fingerprint information.  The locomotive security system shall be integrated with the brake system.  The locomotive will be equipped with both an electronic ID card reader and a finger print scanner.  The FIRE™ computer shall be used to implement the LSS algorithms and for operator PIN input.  

The operator must insert his/her ID card into the electronic ID card reader and input his/her PIN, or place his/her index finger on the fingerprint scanner, before operating the locomotive.  If the operator does not enter the correct PIN, or the fingerprint authentication fails, the locomotive security system will initiate a full service penalty brake application.  During operation of the locomotive, the operator will be asked to periodically enter his/her PIN into the system or place their finger on the fingerprint scanner in order to prevent a penalty brake application from being activated by the LSS.

A task report describing the Locomotive Security System shall be prepared and delivered to FRA for review and comment. This report shall be revised and submitted for final distribution. The prototype hardware shall be delivered for installation and support provided for installation of the same.

Deliverables

Task Deliverables 

The contractor shall document and make available to FRA all applicable software developed as part of this work. The rights to use any proprietary software incorporated into the Train Network System shall be granted to the Government.  The deliverables for each task are listed with each task.
	
Final Report
The final report shall describe all work done under this project referencing individual task reports and other materials.  The final report shall be suitable for publication by the Government. An electronic version, in either MS Word or WordPerfect shall be delivered to the Government. This version shall include all figures and tables. Publication and distribution of all reports and other documents produced as a result of this effort is at the sole discretion of the U.S. Government.
Monthly Summary Management Status Reports
The contractor shall prepare and submit (within 15 days of the end of the reporting period a Monthly Summary Management Status Report, which will be addressed to the COTR It shall briefly describe the work accomplished during the reported during the reported month, problem areas encountered, corrected action(s) taken, and work planned for the next reporting period. Using the Monthly Management Status Form, the report shall detail monthly and cumulatively plan vs. actual activity for both hours and estimated cost for the reported period.  The report shall also highlight any problem areas with respect to expenditures relative to budget, progress relative to schedule, and overall resource allocation. Additionally, the contractor shall notify the OSCOTR and the Contracting Officer when 75% of the total authorized funding has been expended.
Meetings and Oral Presentations 
The Contractor shall participate in tele-conferences on a regular basis and meet quarterly or as arranged by the FRA at a mutually agreed place and time to discuss the status of the work and make oral presentations. The contractor shall furnish the FRA with a minimum of two sets of hard copies of all presentation materials used. The audience for these meetings may include representatives from the FRA, and/or other persons who may be invited to attend.

If the operator fails to authenticate properly, a full service penalty brake would be initiated by the LSS to stop the train and prevent operation of the locomotive The contractor shall develop a prototype system for application to the FRA Advanced Concept Train Locomotive. The contractor shall provide technical support to install, test and verify operation of the LSS. 

Locomotive Security System Concept

The LSS, as envisioned, would use an electronic ID (e.g. smartcard) to prevent unauthorized operation of a locomotive.  In the basic embodiment of the system, authorized locomotive operators would be issued an electronic ID and their own unique PIN.  The PIN is encrypted so that the ID card can not be duplicated if lost or stolen.  The locomotive would be equipped with an electronic ID card reader and keypad.  The electronic ID card readerwould interface to the LSS computer.  The LSS computer would  prevent operation of the locomotive unless a valid PIN is entered by the locomotive operator. A functional discussion follows.

Each time the locomotive comes to a stop, the locomotive operator must enter his PIN before the LSS computer will allow the locomotive to be operated.  While the locomotive is moving, the locomotive operator must periodically enter his PIN.  If the locomotive operator fails to enter the correct PIN, the LSS computer will send a signal to the locomotive airbrake system to initiate a penalty brake application.  A penalty brake application will result in removal of locomotive traction power and the reduction of brake pipe pressure to zero psi at a service rate.  

An optional distress message can automatically be transmitted to alert authorities of unauthorized locomotive operation when an incorrect PIN is entered or when a special PIN is entered (e.g. backward PIN).

In another embodiment of this invention, operator biometric information (e.g. fingerprint) is stored on the electronic ID.  The locomotive is equipped with an electronic ID card reader and corresponding biometric scanner (e.g. fingerprint reader).  The operation is identical to that described above using a PIN to authenticate locomotive operation except that a biometric scan is conducted instead of a PIN being entered by the operator. Periodic reaffirmation can be incorporated with the ALERTER system. The handle may be equipped with a fingerprint scanner which will allow the locomotive engineer/operator continuing authentication. 

As part of this work, the FRA GP40-3 locomotive shall be equipped with an Electro-Motive FIRE™ Locomotive Cab Computer and Display (LCC&D).  FRA proposes to further utilize this locomotive to implement a prototype LSS with capabilities to use either a PIN or a fingerprint for operator authentication.

The proposed locomotive security system shall use an electronic ID card that contains the operator’s encrypted personal identification number (PIN) and fingerprint information.  The locomotive security system shall be integrated with the brake system.  The locomotive will be equipped with both an electronic ID card reader and a finger print scanner.  The FIRE™ computer shall be used to implement the LSS algorithms and for operator PIN input.  

The operator must insert his/her ID card into the electronic ID card reader and input his/her PIN, or place his/her index finger on the fingerprint scanner, before operating the locomotive.  If the operator does not enter the correct PIN, or the fingerprint authentication fails, the locomotive security system will initiate a full service penalty brake application.  During operation of the locomotive, the operator will be asked to periodically enter his/her PIN into the system or place their finger on the fingerprint scanner in order to prevent a penalty brake application from being activated by the LSS.

A task report describing the Locomotive Security System shall be prepared and delivered to FRA for review and comment. This report shall be revised and submitted for final distribution. The prototype hardware shall be delivered for installation and support provided for installation of the same.

Statement of Work

Train Network Management System Development-- Technical Support for Demonstrations of Locomotive Emergency Egress, Locomotive Security System and Advanced Concept Train


Overview of Train Demonstrations— Locomotive Emergency Egress, Advanced Concept Train and Locomotive Security System

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Office of Research and Development proposes to build a five-car train to demonstrate new freight car technology systems that FRA has been developing during the past several years. The demonstration covers three areas from three separate program areas—Rolling Stock and Equipment, Train Occupant Protection and Train Security.  FRA has developed Emergency Egress concepts for locomotives. The roof hatch, removable windshield, detachable door hinge and the Automatic Collision Notification System were developed under the Train Occupant Protection Program to improve locomotive crew safety.  FRA proposes to demonstrate these concepts as part of the demonstrations.  The objective of the Advanced Concept Train (ACT) Project is to develop and demonstrate advanced systems for continuously monitoevelop and demonstrate advanced systems for continuously monitoring and remotely controlling freight car mechanical components to improve freight rail transportation safety and efficiency. This includes the use of Electrically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) Braking.  The program is part of the Rolling Stock Program Element in FRA's Five-Year Strategic Plan for Railroad Research, Development and Demonstrations.  The Locomotive Security System (LSS) is part of the Train Security Program.  The objective of the LSS is to develop and demonstrate advanced concepts to prevent unauthorized operation of locomotives.

During FY 2003 FRA purchased an EMD GP40-3 EM2000 computer controlled locomotive for these projects.   FRA proposes to acquire five freight cars on loan from co-operating railroads for the Advanced Concept Train Demonstration projects. The five freight cars will be equipped with sensors to monitor the following components:

·	Bearings (vibration signature and temperature)
·	Trucks (ride quality and hunting)
·	Wheels (flat and out-of-round)
·	Brakes (piston travel)
·	Car Ride Quality (all three directions)

The freight cars will also be equipped with actuators to remotely control the following components:

·	Coupler
·	Cut-levers
·	Angle-cocks
·	Advanced cushioning device
·	Advanced handbrake

The FRA also plans to equip the ACT locomotive and freight cars with stand alone hard-wired AAR S-4200 compliant Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) brakes.  FRA purchased New York Air Brake’s EP-60 ECP brakes along with locomotive CCB-II brakes to control braking. FRA also plans to upgrade the locomotive to provide locomotive systems for on-board monitoring for safe and efficient maintenance and operation. The ACT locomotive (GP-40-3) will be modified to incorporate a Locomotive Security System (LSS).

An IEEE 802-11b based two-way wireless intra-train communication system will link the freight cars to the locomotive. The communication system enables the freight cars to transmit safety alarms and status information to the locomotive and to receive commands and information requests from the locomotive. When a defect affecting train safety is detected, a safety alarm will be sent to the locomotive to alert the engineer.  Non-critical defects detected during normal operations are flagged and reported for maintenance. The freight car sensor data will also be linked to a remote database server through a wireless telecommunications system.  The database server will be accessible via the Internet.  FRA currently has five cars equipped with the on-board monitoring system operating in a revenue service demonstration in co-operation with Southern Company and Norfolk Southern Corporation.  The experience gained with that demonstration will be extended to the ACT.

Integrating Locomotive Display/Computer Systems with ECP Braking and the ACT Monitoring and Control System

FRA has reviewed available locomotive computer systems for use in the ACT Demonstration Project. The FRA GP-40-3 locomotive is an Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) built locomotive with the EM-2000 computer. The EMD Functionally Integrated Railway Electronics (FIRE) locomotive display and cab computer with integrated Communications Management Unit (CMU) and IntelliTrain remote monitoring system is uniquely qualified to support the FRA ACT project.  The FIRE locomotive display and cab computer is built on a Microsoft Windows embedded XP platform and is designed to operate in the locomotive cab environment.  The FIRE computer uses an EMD proprietary inter-process communication protocol known as NetCore, which is based on a TCP/IP network socket bus architecture.  The FIRE computer CMU supports numerous wireless communications technologies, including 1xRTT and GPRS packet switched cellular, CDMA circuit switched cellular, and 802.11b wireless LAN.  The FIRE computer integrated CMU and NetCore messaging protocol is employed to seamlessly exchange data between the locomotive and remote databases.  EMD has created a FIRE Developer’s Kit (FDK) that provides a set of tools to support development of third party applications for the FIRE locomotive display and cab computer. The FDK will facilitate development of software for the ACT demonstration.

In view of the above FRA is seeking a contractor to support the ACT development team in developing the necessary software and to provide related technical support to install the software on the locomotive FIRE computers installed on the FRA GP-40-3 locomotive. The required software and its function for each of the specific tasks are described in detail below:

TASKS

Task 1: Train Network Management System Development for Actuator Remote Control and On-Board Sensor Monitoring

a) Messaging Protocol Development for communication between the freight cars and the locomotive FIRE computer and locomotive applications 

The contractor shall support the ACT development team in developing a messaging system for two-way communication between the locomotive and the freight cars and between the locomotive and remote database servers.  The messaging system will be based on an open protocol such as Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS).  The messaging system software shall run on the FIRE computer to support operation of various graphical user interfaces for controlling advanced components and displaying monitoring system data and two-way messaging between the locomotive and the ACT freight cars.
b) Graphical User Interfaces on Locomotive FIRE computers
The contractor shall support the ACT development team in developing graphical user interfaces (GUI) on the FIRE computer to control the advanced components (hand brakes, cut levers, angle cocks, etc.) and display information from the passive monitoring system.
c) Transmitting OBMCS (sensor) data to web accessible database server
The contractor shall develop software for the locomotive FIRE computers to transmit car sensor data and pertinent locomotive data (locomotive health status, fuel data, asset tracking) to a web accessible database server when required. The On-Board Monitoring and Control System also provides a direct path to the web accessible database server.  The software shall use the messaging system developed in a).
d) ACT Hazard Analysis
The contractor shall provide engineering technical support to assist with conducting a hazard analysis of the ACT system, particularly the intra-train wireless communication system between the locomotive and the ACT freight cars.  A report describing the Hazard Analysis shall be written and submitted to the FRA.

Task 2:  Locomotive Security System

In recent times there has been a heightened concern about railroad security in the US.  One area of particular concern is the vulnerability of locomotives and trains to operation by unauthorized individuals and the potential use of a train as a terrorist weapon.  It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to stop a loaded train carrying hazardous material, going 70 MPH, in a populated urban area by any means other than by derailing it.  At the very least, this would result in significant property damage and be extremely disruptive to America’s railroad transportation system. FRA, has identified the risk of using a locomotive/train as a terrorist weapon and the unique challenge faced by the railroads to secure their locomotives and infrastructure.

Because many different personnel operate locomotives and they are often interchanged between railroads, locomotives are not equipped with an ignition key like an automobile.  Instead, locomotives are equipped with a universal removable "Reverser" handle that is mechanically interlocked with the locomotive "Throttle" handle.  The "Reverser" handle is inserted into a slot in the locomotive controller mechanism in order to operate the locomotive. Because the "Reverser" handle is designed to be interchangeable between locomotives, a lost, misplaced, stolen or duplicated "Reverser" handle could be used by an unauthorized individual to operate any standard freight or passenger locomotive in North America.  Locomotive cabs are also equipped with door locks, however they are seldom used, especially when the locomotives are being operated.  In any case, they would provide little protection against an armed terrorist determined to hijack a locomotive.

To address these security risks and prevent unauthorized operation of locomotives, FRA would like to develop and demonstrate a Locomotive Security System.  The system, as envisioned, would utilize electronic ID technology, such as SmartCards, to authenticate the identity of a certified locomotive engineer/operator.  If the operator fails to authenticate properly, a full service penalty brake would be initiated by the LSS to stop the train and prevent operation of the locomotive The contractor shall develop a prototype system for application to the FRA Advanced Concept Train Locomotive. The contractor shall provide technical support to install, test and verify operation of the LSS. 

Locomotive Security System Concept

The LSS, as envisioned, would use an electronic ID (e.g. smartcard) to prevent unauthorized operation of a locomotive.  In the basic embodiment of the system, authorized locomotive operators would be issued an electronic ID and their own unique PIN.  The PIN is encrypted so that the ID card can not be duplicated if lost or stolen.  The locomotive would be equipped with an electronic ID card reader and keypad.  The electronic ID card readerwould interface to the LSS computer.  The LSS computer would  prevent operation of the locomotive unless a valid PIN is entered by the locomotive operator. A functional discussion follows.

Each time the locomotive comes to a stop, the locomotive operator must enter his PIN before the LSS computer will allow the locomotive to be operated.  While the locomotive is moving, the locomotive operator must periodically enter his PIN.  If the locomotive operator fails to enter the correct PIN, the LSS computer will send a signal to the locomotive airbrake system to initiate a penalty brake application.  A penalty brake application will result in removal of locomotive traction power and the reduction of brake pipe pressure to zero psi at a service rate.  

An optional distress message can automatically be transmitted to alert authorities of unauthorized locomotive operation when an incorrect PIN is entered or when a special PIN is entered (e.g. backward PIN).

In another embodiment of this invention, operator biometric information (e.g. fingerprint) is stored on the electronic ID.  The locomotive is equipped with an electronic ID card reader and corresponding biometric scanner (e.g. fingerprint reader).  The operation is identical to that described above using a PIN to authenticate locomotive operation except that a biometric scan is conducted instead of a PIN being entered by the operator. Periodic reaffirmation can be incorporated with the ALERTER system. The handle may be equipped with a fingerprint scanner which will allow the locomotive engineer/operator continuing authentication. 

As part of this work, the FRA GP40-3 locomotive shall be equipped with an Electro-Motive FIRE™ Locomotive Cab Computer and Display (LCC&D).  FRA proposes to further utilize this locomotive to implement a prototype LSS with capabilities to use either a PIN or a fingerprint for operator authentication.

The proposed locomotive security system shall use an electronic ID card that contains the operator’s encrypted personal identification number (PIN) and fingerprint information.  The locomotive security system shall be integrated with the brake system.  The locomotive will be equipped with both an electronic ID card reader and a finger print scanner.  The FIRE™ computer shall be used to implement the LSS algorithms and for operator PIN input.  

The operator must insert his/her ID card into the electronic ID card reader and input his/her PIN, or place his/her index finger on the fingerprint scanner, before operating the locomotive.  If the operator does not enter the correct PIN, or the fingerprint authentication fails, the locomotive security system will initiate a full service penalty brake application.  During operation of the locomotive, the operator will be asked to periodically enter his/her PIN into the system or place their finger on the fingerprint scanner in order to prevent a penalty brake application from being activated by the LSS.

A task report describing the Locomotive Security System shall be prepared and delivered to FRA for review and comment. This report shall be revised and submitted for final distribution. The prototype hardware shall be delivered for installation and support provided for installation of the same.

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.
