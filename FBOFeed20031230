<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This announcement amends NRL-Wide Broad Agency Announcement BAA (BAA) 03-01 posted on Jan 02, 2003 by restating the list of BAA topics valid through 31 December 2004, noting topic cancellations and revisions. The Naval Research Laboratory is interested in receiving innovative proposals that offer potential for advancement and improvement in the technical topic areas listed. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.302(d) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. This BAA is a continuously open announcement valid through 31 December 2004. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. Awards may take the form of a contract, grant or cooperative agreement. Multiple awards are anticipated. NRL encourages Educational Institutions, Small Businesses (SBs), Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns (SDBs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) to submit proposals under this BAA. In order to conserve valuable offeror and Government resources, prospective offerors shall first submit an initial proposal, including a rough cost estimate, to the technical point of contact for each topic. Prospective offerors are encouraged to submit initial proposals as early in the fiscal year as possible to maximize the potential for award. The selection of proposals for award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to each BAA. The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal. Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation. Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds. The complete BAA including proposal preparation instructions, technical points of contact for each topic, and evaluation criteria is available at http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/baa.htm A list of specific research topics of interest follows.  Cancellations and revisions to specific topics are noted within. POC information for individual topics is not identified here.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Tax Analysts, 6830 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA, 22213, to purchase 1,770 Tax Analysts Federal Tax Baedeker handbooks for FY 2004, with similar quantities anticipated for fiscal years 2005 through 2008.  The Federal Tax Baedeker provides an explanation to key federal tax laws and regulations. It covers the latest tax provisions affecting individuals, business entities, trusts and estates. The Baedeker answers questions about exclusions and deductions, capital gains and losses, gift and generation-skipping taxes, and self-employment and estimated tax payments. It also reflects the recent changes made by tax legislation. These handbooks have been determined to meet the definition of commercial items in accordance with Part 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

<SUBJECT>S -- Privatization of the Electric, Natural Gas and Water Distribution Systems and Wastewater Collection System at The United States Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-122903A
<RESPDATE>011204

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to privatize the electrical, natural gas, water distribution and wastewater collection infrastructure systems at The United States Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, CO. The Air Force Academy (AFA) is located north of the city limits of Colorado Springs, CO. There are 18,455 acres of land within the AFA boundaries. The electric, natural gas and water distribution systems and wastewater collection system are being considered for privatization. The utility system information provided here is an estimate only and is subject to change. The electrical distribution system: The City of Colorado Springs provides and wheels power to two substations at the AFA. The City owns and operates the 34.5kV overhead lines and equipment in the substations. The AFA owns and operates the 34.5kV–12.5kV substation transformers and all 12.5kV distribution equipment. The 12.5kV equipment at the substation is metal-clad switchgear. The distribution system is primarily concrete encased duct bank from the substations to the AFA facilities with select and interrupt switches in manholes and transformer vaults. Most transformers are unit substation type (dry or oil-filled) in vaults in the buildings. Some are pad-mount type adjacent to buildings. There are some single-phase overhead lines to remote facilities. Natural gas distribution system: The natural gas distribution system at the AFA consists of a network of approximately 189,000 lineal feet of coated and wrapped steel and polyethylene piping, ranging in size from 1 to 14 inches in diameter. The City of Colorado Springs provides and supplies natural gas through a single metering station. The main natural gas transmission line begins at a metering station east of Interstate 25. Gas is taken from the metering station at 50psig. The majority of the steel gas piping is protected with three-deep anode bed systems with rectifier units. Distribution piping within the Military Family Housing (MFH) areas is protected with galvanic anodes. There are 11 pressure regulating valve pits located throughout the AFA where the gas pressure is reduced to 15 psig for further distribution.  The gas pressure is reduced to a few ounces by individual regulators at each building such as residencies in the MFH areas. Meters and regulators will be privatized. The Water distribution system consists of approximately 283,000 lineal feet of water mains consisting of various materials ranging in size from 4 to 24 inches. All of the potable water supply comes from the City of Colorado Springs supply main (or supply pipeline). Potable water is stored in the AFA’s four reservoirs, which have a total storage capacity of 3.4 million gallons. A chlorinating system is located at each reservoir. A fluoridation system serves the MFH area. The system was originally installed between the years 1958 and 1960. The underground piping systems are protected against external corrosion with cathodic protection. During 1987 and 1988, all cathodic protection systems at the AFA were upgraded. Wastewater collection system: The AFA operates an extensive wastewater collection system that drains the major building areas and grounds from the western boundary, east to the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) located near the east boundary off of Stadium Boulevard. The wastewater collection system consists of approximately 330,000 lineal feet of pipe and three lift stations. The pipe materials used are vitrified clay, reinforced concrete, cast iron, and PVC, 21 inches in diameter and smaller. Some lift stations include backup power generators, which will be included in the privatization. The WWTP treats wastewater treated within the AFA. The wastewater treatment plant is a 2.0-MGD activated sludge plant operating at approximately 1.0 to 1.4 MGD. Its 30-day average biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids limits are 25 and 10 respectively with varying seasonal discharges to nearby Monument Creek. The WWTP consists of preliminary, primary, and secondary treatments, filtration, disinfection, and sludge handling. The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right of Way as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  At this time, no solicitation exists: therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION. Vendors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirement are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought including, commercial market information and company information via e-mail or facsimile (703-767-2382) to Mily Le, no later than January 12, 2004.

<SUBJECT>D -- Notice of intent to negotiate a sole-source acquisition for services related to the development of a disaster recovery infrastructure for the Federal and State Disability Determination Services

<DESC>NOTICE OF GOVERNMENT INTENT TO NEGOTIATE ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS

This posting provides notice that the Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate a sole-source acquisition pursuant to FAR 12 with Versa Management Systems Inc. (Versa). This notice is neither a request for quotation nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. 

Under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act (42 USC 402 and 416), SSA mandates the State Disability Determination Services (DDS) in each state to perform determinations of disability for the residents of that state who file for Social Security disability benefits. In addition to each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territorial governments of Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands have established DDS entities. SSA has also established a Federal DDS, which, among other functions, serves as a test-bed of policy and procedure for the disability program. Virtually every DDS currently uses, or is migrating toward the use of an IBM AS/400 (now known as IBM iSeries) mid-range processor for case processing.  Many of the state DDS’s use licensed proprietary software developed by Versa Management Systems Inc (Versa). Over the last few years, SSA and the DDS’s have been engaged in major initiatives to improve and safeguard the administration of the disability programs. One such initiative is the development of comprehensive disaster recovery for DDS operations.

This sole source acquisition will be for services related to the development of a disaster recovery infrastructure for the Federal and State Disability Determination Services (DDS) that utilize IBM AS/400 (now known as IBM iSeries) mid-range processors and Versa licensed proprietary software. Specific services to be procured from Versa include: 1) assistance in conducting exercises with the State DDS’s and SSA to simulate disaster and implementation of disaster recovery plans, 2) expert technical troubleshooting support to the State DDS’s and SSA during disaster recovery, 3) assistance in the restoration of the affected DDS’s production environment, and, 4) assistance in ensuring that DDS production data is not corrupted during simulation exercises.

At this time the Government believes Versa Management Systems to be the only source capable of providing the required services, as Versa is the only known source that can provide, modify and maintain its own software and source code. SSA will not provide the Versa proprietary source code to any third-party, nor will SSA assist any third-party in obtaining access to Versa’s proprietary source code. 

Vendors having the capability and experience to provide such services are invited to submit complete details regarding their technical capabilities and expertise. Vendor capability statements MUST include the following: 1) demonstrated success in supporting the IBM AS/400 platform, and, 2) a detailed explanation of the strategy that will be used in dealing with the Versa proprietary source code and data structures. 

The Government will consider all responses to this notice, but a determination by the Government to conduct a sole source acquisition remains at the discretion of the Government. Information submitted in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining the feasibility of conducting a competitive procurement, and the Government will not pay for any information submitted. Interested sources that believe they have the ability to perform the services required should submit a detailed statement of their capabilities in writing to Leslie Hyman, Contract Specialist, via email at Leslie.Hyman@ssa.gov. Responses must be received by 3:00 p.m. EST on January 14, 2004. If no viable responses are received by January 14, 2004, the Government will issue a Purchase Order to Versa Management Systems, Inc.

2.	PROJECT INFORMATION:
The National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS) is a GIS database that contains the locations and selected attributes of hazardous liquid and gas transmission pipelines, breakout tanks, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities operating in onshore and offshore territories of the United States where the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) has authority to regulate pipeline facilities.  The NPMS was developed as a joint effort between the U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), other Federal and state agencies, and the pipeline industry.  The NPMS originally consisted of pipeline and LNG facility data voluntarily submitted by pipeline operators.  The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (codified at 49 U.S.C., 60132) requires that pipeline operators submit their hazardous liquid and gas transmission pipeline and LNG data to the NPMS.  The data collected for the NPMS is necessary for regulatory oversight and for monitoring the security of the pipelines.

The NPMS National Repository is operated and maintained by a contractor working on behalf of OPS.  The current National Repository began operation in 1998. The current contractor has assisted in finalizing the first NPMS Operator Standards in March 1999; developing procedures for collecting, editing, and processing pipeline and LNG geospatial data; developing quality control procedures; advising OPS on technical issues; developing and maintaining the NPMS homepage at www.npms.rspa.dot.gov; developing Web-based GIS applications; providing system integrity and security; providing on-site GIS support in OPS; updating the NPMS Operator Standards in January 2003; and updating the NPMS Repository Standards in March 2003.  The latest standards are available from the NPMS website at www.npms.rspa.dot.gov.

The NPMS originally consisted of a single National Repository and multiple state repositories.  In September 2002, OPS ended the state repository program in favor of using a single National Repository for the processing and storage of the NPMS geospatial data. The National Repository is responsible for processing and maintaining pipeline data, LNG facilities, and breakout tanks.  Pipeline operators are required to make updated submissions to the NPMS as changes occur along their pipeline system.

SELECTION CRITERIA:  See FedBizOps numbered Note 24 for a general description of the selection process. Following an initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, three or more firms considered to be most highly qualified to provide the type of services required will be chosen for negotiation.  Selection of firms for negotiation will be through an order of precedence based on demonstrated competence and qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required that include the following criteria which are of equal importance: (a) Demonstrated specialized experience and technical competence in: (1) managing and maintaining large relational geospatial databases in a GIS, including demonstrated experience in working with the full line of ESRI software including ArcGIS 8.x, ArcSDE, ArcIMS, ArvView 3.x and Oracle RDBMS, (2) working with U.S. hazardous liquid and gas transmission pipeline companies and their respective data records, and (3) converting digital data, digitizing paper maps, managing relational databases, projecting data, and performing quality-control processes.
