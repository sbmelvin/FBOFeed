<SUBJECT>Avian Influenza Vaccines, Eurasian HPAI H5
<SOLNBR>AG-6395-S-16-0066
<ARCHDATE>03312016
<CONTACT>James Roloff, Contracting Officer, Phone 612-336-3223, Email james.g.roloff@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) intends to award multiple commercial, indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts for vaccines and vaccine combinations effective against Eurasian highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5 clade 2.3.4.4 (EA H5) in order to establish an emergency vaccine stockpile.
<p>The APHIS National Veterinary Stockpile (NVS) is the nation's repository of critical veterinary supplies, equipment, and service resources. It exists because of the nation's concern over animal diseases of catastrophic proportions that would<br />&bull; deplete State and local response inventories, <br />&bull; generate surge requirements that would overwhelm commercial sources, and<br />&bull; prevent unaffected States from providing significant help for fear of the threat crossing their borders</p>
<p>NVS's ability to deploy within 24 hours large amounts of critical veterinary resources ensures states have what they need to respond to catastrophes and other outbreaks. The arrival and subsequent evolution of Eurasian HPAI H5 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4 lineage (EA H5 viruses) in North America has resulted in a catastrophic epiornitic, affecting both domestic poultry and captive avian wildlife. These viruses may persist within the wild bird compartment which could serve as a reservoir and pose a significant threat to U.S. poultry and avian collections.</p>
<p>Therefore, NVS seeks sufficient supplies of vaccine, to be used singly or in combination with other vaccines that are effective against EA H5 viruses, suitable for use in chickens and/or turkeys ranging from one-day of age up to &ge; 3 years of age. The goal is to acquire and maintain an emergency/supplementary stockpile of EA H5 vaccines available for delivery anywhere in the United States within 24 hours of order by the NVS.</p>
<p>Such products might include but not be limited to the following formulations/platforms: finished vaccine with shelf-life &ge; 1 year; vaccine precursors that can be rapidly processed into finished vaccine (e.g., antigen concentrates for inactivated vaccines) with potency retention of &ge; 2 years; and modified-live, or nonviable/nonreplicating vaccines that can be stored in a manner to ensure potency retention of &ge; 2 years. This vaccine stockpile would be used for emergency vaccination and to supplement commercial supplies as part of a larger vaccination campaign. All finished vaccines or vaccine precursors would be stored and maintained at the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Nationally, the placement rate of laying hens and meat turkeys is approximately 20 million birds per month. With each bird requiring two doses of vaccine prior to placement, 80 million doses per month will be needed just for these two sectors alone. Therefore, vaccine companies should minimally have a production capacity &ge; 100 million doses per month to address these two sectors.</p>
<p>NVS seeks a contract that will have the following components: <br />1) Production and banking of AI vaccine or vaccine precursors: Contractors would produce and store product and must demonstrate a storage capacity of a minimum of 100 million doses to a maximum of 500 million doses of vaccine or vaccine precursor that are effective against EA H5 viruses, whether used alone or as combinations of different vaccines;<br />2) Vaccine must be fully licensed, conditionally licensed, or permitted (only products permitted for general distribution and sale will be considered) in accordance with the Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) regulations in order to be eligible for award. Delivery anywhere within the continental U.S. of up to 100 million doses of finished vaccine eligible for distribution and sale must be made within 10 calendar days of order as directed by the NVS;<br />3) Vaccine or vaccine precursor must be stored in a manner consistent with the longest potency viability of the product, and demonstrate satisfactory potency when tested at 12 month intervals throughout the duration of the contract;<br />4) Small serials of finished vaccine from vaccine precursor will be produced by the manufacturer every 12 months and potency tested by the manufacturer and provide potency data for review by the CVB;<br />5) Samples of finished vaccine and/or serum samples from vaccinated birds will be provided to CVB if requested by the CVB; <br />6) Product will be stored by the manufacturer in a manner that ensures the longest shelf life while retaining satisfactory potency as determined by the CVB (e.g., vaccine antigen concentrate) which shall be no less than two years;</p>
<p>The contracts will have a guaranteed minimum of $6 million worth of doses up to a maximum of 500 million doses of vaccine or vaccine precursor effective against EA H5. The North American Industry Classification System code is 325414 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. Solicitation number AG-6395-S-16-0066 will be issued on an unrestricted basis and posted on FBO on or about February 22, 2016. Any questions or inquiries must be e-mailed to Jim Roloff, contracting officer, at james.g.roloff@aphis.usda.gov.</p>

<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Edgewood Contracting Division intends to negotiate an extension of the period of performance under existing sole source Purchase Order W911SR-15-P-0008 with MRIGlobal, Inc., 425 Volker Blvd Kansas City, MO 64110 under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1)(i), for maintenance/sustainment of the Individual Protection Ensemble Mannequin System (IPEMS) facility at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah. The IPEMS was designed, developed and installed at DPG by MRIGlobal under competitively awarded contract.</p>
<p>MRIGlobal designed IPEMS as a highly specialized unique system which is in the component level verification stage of development and consists of an integrated IPE Mannequin, exposure chamber, and control room. Since the IPEMS is incomplete, and the required maintenance program has not been fully developed, the Government requires a contractor familiar with this highly specialized one-of-a-kind system to perform the maintenance during FY2016. Currently, the Government does not have trained individuals on site at DPG with operational knowledge and experience to properly sustain the IPEMS facility. The anticipated award of the modified Purchase Order is anticipated no later than 23 February 2016.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quote. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<SUBJECT>Field Trials of General Use Pesticides for the Control of Vector Ticks
<SOLNBR>2016-Q-64693
<RESPDATE>022916
<CONTACT>Caleb Watkins Owen, Phone 7704882833, Email xyl3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The vendor shall furnish all labor, materials and equipment necessary to evaluate the efficacy of select commercially available pesticides available as over-the-counter and labeled for tick control against nymphal and larval deer ticks and lone star ticks in a field setting on Naval Weapons Station Earle, Colts Neck, New Jersey. Vendor needs to be a licensed pest control operator in the state of New Jersey, have an approved Experimental Use-Scientific Collecting Permit (New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection) to conduct the study, and supply appropriate equipment for pesticide applications. The vendor will identify suitable test plots that contain &gt; 0.1 nymph/m2, mark and stake each treatment and control plot, and conduct weekly pre- and post-treatment flagging and sampling to determine the ability of these products to effectively control questing ticks and reduce the risk of tick-borne diseases. Vendor will provide weekly reports and perform statistical analysis. All data will be sent to CDC/NCEZID/DVBD, Fort Collins, CO.
<p>TASKS TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>-A minimum of 5 plots/treatment, including untreated controls, of 100-m2 area will be established and staked for each treatment. There will be a total of 3 test products as well as an untreated control or 20 plots total. Plots should be established in areas where documented populations of I. scapularis and/or A. americanum are well-established (&gt; 0.1 tick/m2). Plots need to be established in uniform forest stands with minimal edge so that direct comparison of observed pesticide efficacy can be made without potential for environment conditions (e.g., variation in tick numbers due to habitat differences, microclimate conditions, variations in habitat associated with residential properties, etc.) confounding the results. In addition, trials are to be conducted in areas where access to spray plots can be closely controlled and monitored.</p>
<p>-Plots will be sampled a minimum of 3 times prior to applying acaricides at weekly intervals to determine tick abundance.</p>
<p>-Acaricides will be applied using label rates and recommendations for tick control to all treatment plots during a single 24-h period. Applications are to be made at the onset of peak nymphal tick abundance (e.g., on or about June 1 in New Jersey).</p>
<p>-Acaricides will be applied by licensed commercial pesticide applicators. All acaricides will be formulated as granular products and will be applied according to label instructions and applied using homeowner grade spreaders.</p>
<p>-All plots will be sampled by dragging/flagging at 24 hr and 1, 2, 3, and 4 wk post-application to determine initial treatment efficacy and residual activity against ticks. Efficacy data will be recorded for each trial and statistical analysis performed. Written reports will be provided to CDC/DVBD PI by email and Word documents.</p>
<p>-Selection of test products to be applied have been determined based on sales volume, market share, and other measures (Consumer Reports). Indirect measures included studies that looked at exposure, pesticide storage, and environmental contamination (which may suggest what pesticides are most often being used). Based on findings in the literature, (see Section 11), carbaryl is the most often applied pesticide in the home and garden market, followed by pyrethroids, most notably bifenthrin. The vendor must apply at minimum 1 carbaryl product and 1-2 pyrethroid products (or a third product representing an alternative AI) pre-selected by the CDC/DVBD PI.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The period of performance shall commence upon receipt of a purchase order and shall continue for a period of 365 days. The anticipated award date is on or before May 1, 2016.</p>

Vendor <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will Provide a written <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; report to CDC, DVBD project <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; officer via email and Word <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; documents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CDC/DVBD PI will determine if the deliverables have been met sequentially prior to releasing approval for payment to vendor. Factors that may affect accomplishing the deliverables as outlined and according to provided timeline would include but not be limited to: adverse weather events that prevent timely application of pesticides and subsequent flagging of all plots; weather conditions that affect questing tick populations, and a delay in notice of award to vendor. The timelines as suggested are critical in order to assess efficacy during the nymphal tick season (May - June) and the larval season (Aug - Sept).</p>
<p>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All trials will be conducted at Naval Weapons Station Earle, Colts Neck, NJ. This is a secure military installation with access limited to investigators possessing prior approval for entry. Vendor must have approved access to work on this facility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This acquisition will use sole source simplified procedures in accordance with FAR 13.106(b)(1). This requirement is not set aside for small businesses. CDC is not requesting competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Interested parties who believe they possess the capabilities to satisfy this requirement should indicate their interest in writing and submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, on February 29, 2015. Determination not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Respondents will assume all financial costs for preparing a response to this notice. The U.S. Government assumes no financial obligation for the preparation and distribution of prepared responses. Inquiries may be sent to Caleb Owen via email at xyl3@cdc.gov.</p>

<ARCHDATE>02292016
<CONTACT>Gibran Mills, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-245-6072, Email gibran.mills@ed.gov - Veronica L. Price, Sr. Contracting Officer, Phone 202-245-6158, Fax 202-245-6278, Email veronica.price@ed.gov
<DESC>***THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS***<br /> This synopsis notice is posted in accordance with FAR Part 5.203(a).
<p>The U.S. Department of Education (Department) anticipates the solicitation and award of one hybrid contract (contains both Fixed Price and Cost Reimbursement Tasks) for a new Fiscal Year 2016 procurement titled "Study of an Information Strategy to Increase Enrollment in Postsecondary Education" (hereafter referred to as "EOC") on behalf of the Institute for Education Sciences (IES), National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE).  The purpose of the requirement is to conduct a study of an information strategy to increase participation in postsecondary education among individuals from low income families and those who are potential first generation college students.</p>

The study is designed to examine a strategy which may improve EOCs' effectiveness in meeting the program's aim of increasing the number of disadvantaged adults who enroll in postsecondary education.  EOC grantees provide information and counseling to clients in-person and via telephone.  The Department seeks to test whether systematic, low-cost messaging can enhance these services. The DRAFT EOC Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for reference.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the anticipated contract is 75 months (if the option period is exercised), broken out as indicated below:</p>
<p>Base Period (19 months) <br />&bull;	The 19 month Base Period focuses on convening the first meeting of the study's Technical Working Group, grantee recruitment, designing data collection, obtaining The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Institutional Review Board (IRB) clearances for data collection, designing the study intervention, and designing the client recruitment and random assignment process within each study site.</p>
<p>Option Period (56 months)<br />&bull;	The 56 month Option Period focuses on obtaining client intake data from grantees, randomly assigning eligible clients, implementing the intervention, collecting and analyzing study data, convening a meeting of the study's Technical Work Group in order to discuss preliminary findings, and producing a report that includes the final study findings.</p>
<p><br />The Department anticipates posting the EOC Request for Proposals on www.FBO.gov in late February or early March 2016.  It is anticipated that the acquisition strategy will be a negotiated, competitive acquisition (open to both small and large businesses) conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.</p>

<DESC>Item Description: NSN 2510-01-618-1087- Plate, Mounting, bought in accordance with AM General (34623) part number 6042541. Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item with 15 days of this notice. The required quantity is 840 units with a 50% option shipping to (W62G2T) Tracy, CA 95376-5000. This solicitation is being issued under the First Destination Transportation (FDT) program. FOB origin and inspection at destination are required. This solicitation will be available on the internet at http://www.dibbs.bsmdla.mil/rfp after the issue date of 02/23/16. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery and past performance. The required delivery is 210 days. Surplus is not acceptable for this procurement and will not be considered. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in English and in US dollars. All interested parties may submit an offer.<br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br />Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed. E-mailed proposal shall not be transmitted directly to the contracting officer. Submit e-mailed proposals to the Bid and Abstract Room at: ContractorProposalDLALandandMaritime@dla.mil.

THIS ORIGINAL MARKET SURVEY WAS POSTED ON THE FAA'S CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES WEBSITE (FAACO.FAA.GOV).  IF YOU ARE VIEWING THIS FROM ANOTHER SOURCE, THE INFORMATION MAY NOT CONTAIN ALL PERTINENT INFORMATION.
GENERAL INFORMATION:

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), is conducting a Market Survey to improve the Governments understanding of the current marketplace and to identify qualified and capable sources.  This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Offer (RFO) of any kind.  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of metal enclosures and panels for electronic equipment for Instrument Landing System shelters.  Seven different sizes/types of enclosures are described in the (draft) Technical Exhibit attached to this market survey.  

The requirement is for an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract with firm-fixed-price pricing arrangements.  First article testing of each enclosure/panel will be required.  The resultant contract will include four one-year option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the Government. 

BACKGROUND

Metal enclosures and panels are required for the FAA Logistics Center (FAALC) Equipment Shelter Program, which is a subset of the AML-2070 Structure Support Branch.  Instrument Landing System (ILS) and/or Airfield Lighting System (ALS) electronics equipment is normally installed in fiberglass equipment buildings or shelters.  Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) are the equipment that provides radio guidance to aircraft on final approach to the runway.  ILS systems can include a glideslope, localizer, DME, or marker beacon.  Airfield Lighting Systems (ALS) are the lighting systems providing visual guidance on some CAT I sites, e.g., medium intensity Approach Lighting System w/REILS (MALSR).  Electrical connections to/from the shelters are typically installed inside the metal enclosures.  Electronic equipment such as lighting arresters can also be located inside these enclosures.

The metal enclosures and panels must adhere to the specifications defined in the (draft) Technical Exhibit.

Responses to this market survey may be used to determine if there is adequate competition to set the requirement aside for Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, or the 8(a) program in lieu of opening the acquisition up for full and open competition.

Any information provided in response to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  Vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.

Interested sources should provide evidence of qualifications/capabilities available to manufacture metal enclosures and panels for electronic equipment for Instrument Landing System shelters.

The NAICS Code for this requirement is 332312 Fabricated Structural Metal Manufacturing, with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.

Response submittals must include information for the following three (3) requests:

1.  Vendor responses will describe the resources available to meet the description set forth in this market survey and provide documentation that clearly demonstrates that the interested vendor is qualified and capable to manufacture metal enclosures and panels for electronic equipment in accordance with the (draft) 
Technical Exhibit.  The format of the documentation is at the discretion of the vendor.  

2. A short list of projects for which the vendor has successfully manufactured similar enclosures and panels shall be submitted to demonstrate the capabilities that the vendor possesses in this area. Points of contact for each project must be included on the list.

3.  Completed and signed Business Declaration Form (attached) for descriptive information regarding the business status of the vendor.

All response submittals (one response per company) are to be provided with a cover letter on company letterhead.  Responses must be received no later than 2:00 P.M, local time February 23, 2016.  Market survey responses received after the time and date specified may be determined to be late and may not be considered.

All response submittals, including attachments, shall be submitted electronically to the following email address:  connie.m.houpt@faa.gov, Reference: Metal Enclosures and Panels Market Survey.  

All interested vendors are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this market survey.  Therefore, any costs associated with vendors market survey submissions will be solely at the interested vendors expense.

All FAA documents are to be downloaded and printed from the FAA Contracting Opportunities web site found at http://faaco.faa.gov (or by access through http://fast.faa.gov).  Please note that documents downloaded from sites other than the FAAs Contracting Opportunities web site may not be the latest documents.  


NOTE:  Any contract awarded for the requirements above will contain the AMS Clause 3.3.1-33 System for Award Management (August 2012).  Award cannot be made to a vendor that has not accomplished this registration.  See paragraph (d) of the clause below:

***(d) If the offeror does not become registered in the SAM database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered offeror.

<p><br />FEMA Directive 262-3 dated 11-03-11 designates the ENS system as the official FEMA solution for emergency notification. No other notification systems have been authorized for FEMA use. This system is provided by Airbus DS Communication, Inc. and is known as the VESTA&reg; Communicator. Installing and uploading another product from another contractor will void the warranty with Airbus DS Communications, Inc. and possibly create interoperability issues. FEMA requires an authorized service provider of VESTA&reg; Communicator to perform these services.</p>
<p>Maintenance and support specifications required for this system include:<br />&bull; 24x7 on-site support to 3 separate locations <br />&bull; Datasync replication from primary to 2 backup systems <br />&bull; SMS\text messaging provided through the existing Airbus DS SMS gateway to include accounting, monitoring, usage report and unlimited messages <br />&bull; On-site 24x7 technical support and maintenance for Survey Module <br />&bull; On-site 24x7 technical support and maintenance for a Workstation Alert <br />&bull; Inbound Bulletin Board <br />&bull; Updates to new versions of VESTA&reg; Communicator software<br />&bull; Training for VESTA&reg; Communicator application <br />&bull; Able to create or modify custom call flows<br />&bull; Able to create or modify Pager services with the VESTA&reg; Communicator application <br />&bull; 24x7 on-site support for Custom Report module <br />&bull; 10 separate DHS agencies are supported</p>
<p>The contractor shall not modify any current VESTA&reg; Communicator or FEMA configuration settings external or internal to the existing systems including passwords and user accounts. <br /><br />FEMA is aware of no other firm, other than Airbus DS Communications, Inc. that can provide the type of services and software maintenance described here. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government, and information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining if other potential sources for these services exist. FEMA will not be responsible for paying for any of the costs incurred or associated with the development of any responses submitted to this posting. However, any firm that believes it is capable of providing these services, and is an authorized service provider of VESTA&reg; Communicator, shall e-mail a Statement of Capabilities to Christine Todd at Christine.Todd@fema.dhs.gov.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent.
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a Brand name only basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with the Savillex Corporation, located in Eden Prairie, New Mexico to purchase long term storage Perfluoroalkoxy polymer resin (PFA) Jars for laboratory use.</p>
<p>Brand name only justification is based on the following:</p>
<p>To meet its mission requirements, the Chemical Science Division supports the former National Biomonitoring Specimen Bank (NBSB) facility at NIST Gaithersburg, MD and the current Marine Environmental Specimen Bank (Marine ESB) at NIST Charleston, SC. The NBSB was established by NIST in 1979 for the long-term preservation of representative environmental specimens for deferred analysis and evaluation. These valuable samples enable investigators to extend their research into the past and provides for future verification of analytical results. The Marine ESB was established in 2002 at the Hollings Marine Laboratory to continue NIST's specimen banking efforts by taking the lead on all current projects of the NBSB. In 2010 the NBSB was shut down and all of the samples archived over the past 30+ years at that facility were transferred to the Marine ESB.<br />Thousands of samples continue to be collected and archived for many projects and are stored at both -150&deg; C (LN2 vapor phase freezers) and -80&deg; C (mechanical freezers) temperatures. <br />The PFA jars with recessed lids being requested are used in continuing research projects that began in 1979 during the development of the NBSB. The jars are used to store tissues collected in the field for long-term archival (100+ years) and for contaminants analysis, both organic (PCB's, PBDE's, PAH's, DDT's, etc.) and inorganic (mercury, lead, arsenic, etc.), for all projects, including the National Marine Mammal Tissue Bank, the Seabird Tissue Archival and Monitoring Project, the Health Assessment of Bottlenose Dolphins Project, and the Pacific Islands Specimen Banking expansion. <br />The jars used by the Marine ESB for archival storage must be made from PFA because of the potential for organic materials leaching from the jar into the sample. The jars are stored in liquid nitrogen vapor phase freezers (-150 &ordm;C - 190 &deg;C) and must be able to hold up to these temperatures for years without cracking, breaking or leaking. Because the specimen bank is set up for long-term archival, the dimensions of the jars are important. Racking systems (boxes and tubes) have been specially created for the dimensions of the Savillex jars to fit inside each rack type in order to maximize space inside the freezers. The jars undergo a rigorous cleaning procedure involving chloroform, ethyl alcohol, hydrochloric acid and nitric acid and must be able to withstand all chemical baths. The jars must be packaged in dust free polyethylene bags because the specimen bank is located in certified ISO Class 5 and 7 clean rooms. This ensures that no further contamination occurs when the jars are brought in to the clean room for preparation (i.e. chemical baths, storage, and archive). The lids must be recessed on the jars in order to accommodate a durable label to be snapped into the lid to identify the sample properly. Labels will not adhere to jars made from PFA either at room temperature or at cryogenic temperatures. Therefore, the recessed lid and tabs are an essential requirement of the jar.</p>
<p>Savillex jars have been used since the inception of the NBSB and in order to meet our mission, sampling protocols and materials cannot be altered. One of the primary objectives of the Marine ESB is to provide samples that are collected and banked in a systematic and well documented manner for comparing results over time to identify whether environmental trends exist. Alternative manufacturers have slight variations in formulations when creating PFA products. NIST has identified that chemical compounds are not leached by the jars made from Savillex. Storing one of a kind, valuable samples in an assortment of jars from different manufactures would undermine the comparability of our samples throughout the 36 years of sample collections, potentially jeopardizing the scientific accuracy of decades of research. Testing if a new manufacturer's jars are suitable for long term storage would require many years and hundreds of additional staff hours to conduct analytical measurements before we could verify that the new jars do not contaminate the sample.<br />It is based on this rationale that NIST has concluded Savillex brand PFA jars are the only brand reasonably available. <br />The resulting purchase order will be a Firm Fixed Price purchase order.<br />The NAICS Code for this procurement will be 326111-Plastics packaging manufacturing and the small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by 12:00EST February 19th, 2016, will be considered by the Government.<br />A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br />Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />Inquiry POCs<br /><br />erik.frycklund@nist.gov Primary<br />grace.garrity@nist.gov Secondary<br /><br />National Institutes of Standards and Technologies NIST<br />Acquisition Management Division (AMD)<br />100 Bureau Dr. Mail Stop 1640 <br />Gaithersburg, MD. 20899-1640</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent.
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with the KNF Corporation, located in Tamaqua, Pennsylvania to purchase Fluoro Ethylene Propylene (FEP) bags for laboratory use.</p>

<p>To meet its mission requirements, the Chemical Science Division supports the former National Biomonitoring Specimen Bank (NBSB) facility at NIST Gaithersburg, MD and the current Marine Environmental Specimen Bank (Marine ESB) at NIST Charleston, SC. The NBSB was established by NIST in 1979 for the long-term preservation of representative environmental specimens for deferred analysis and evaluation.

Thousands of samples continue to be collected and archived for many projects and are stored at both -150&deg; C (LN2 vapor phase freezers) and -80&deg;C (mechanical freezers) temperatures.<br />The FEP bags have been used in continuing research projects that began in 1979 during the development of the NBSB. The bags are used to ship, process, and store tissues collected in the field for long-term archival (100+ years) and for contaminants analysis, both organic (PCB's, PBDE's, PAH's, DDT's, etc.) and inorganic (mercury, lead, arsenic, etc.), for all projects, including the National Marine Mammal Tissue Bank, the Seabird Tissue Archival and Monitoring Project, the Health Assessment of Bottlenose Dolphins Project, and the Pacific Islands Specimen Banking expansion.<br />The bags used by the Marine ESB for archival storage and processing of samples must be made from FEP Type-A because of the potential for organic materials leaching from the material into the sample. The bags are stored in liquid nitrogen vapor phase freezers (-150 &ordm;C - 190 &deg;C) and must be able to hold up to these temperatures for many years with minimal cracking, breaking or leaking. <br />These bags must be double packaged by the manufacturer in dust free polyethylene bags because the specimen bank is located in certified ISO Class 5 and 7 clean rooms. This ensures that no further contamination of the clean room occurs when the bags and sheets are brought in to the clean room for preparation of sample processing or storage. All bags must bear a Certificate of Conformance to NASA Specifications JPG 5322.1 Level 50 Surface Cleanliness Levels for Precision Packaging Materials.<br />It is required that these Fluoro Ethylene Propylene bags manufactured by KNF Corporation be purchased to provide continued sample collections and any deviation in supplies may contain different formulations of FEP. One of the primary objectives of the Marine ESB is to provide samples that are collected and banked in a systematic and well documented manner for comparing results over time to identify whether environmental trends exist. Storing one of a kind, valuable samples in an assortment of bags from different manufactures would undermine the comparability of the samples throughout the 36 years of collections potentially jeopardizing the scientific accuracy of decades of research. Analyses by NIST researchers are sensitive enough to pick up variations in chemicals leached from the bags storing the samples. When researchers use samples stored in bags from 1979 and 2015 to determine levels of the trace elements or other chemicals present in the sample they must make the assumption that the samples are stored or processed in bags with the same baseline chemicals, otherwise they are not comparable. Testing if a new manufacturer's bags are suitable and do not alter measurement comparability would require many years and hundreds of additional staff hours to conduct analytical measurements.<br />It is based on this rationale that NIST has concluded the KNF Corporation brand items are the only source reasonably available.</p>
<p>The resulting purchase order will be a Firm Fixed Price purchase order.<br />The NAICS Code for this procurement will be 326111-Plastics packaging manufacturing and the small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>

<p>Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division intends to issue a Job Order (JO) under a sole source Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00164-12-G-JQ66.

Acquisitions under the BOA have been and will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

As a result of this JO the overall contract ceiling for BOA N00164-12-G-JQ66 will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>This JO is anticipated to procure the retrofit of three (3) standard definition MTS Turrets into high definition turrets. In addition, required software revisions will be conducted, as well as technical documentation updates.</p>
<p>Request for proposal will not be made available through http://www.fbo.gov. The request for proposal will be provided to Raytheon Company through electronic mail.

<p>This action is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: After testing and certification, it was determined the Alta Data Technologies LLC is the only vendor that can provide an Ethernet appliance that has been tested and certified to meet the functional and environmental requirements of the LCAC C4N SBC4 specifications. As such, Alta Data Technologies LLC is the only source capable of meeting this requirement.</p>
<p>Procuring other commercial items would require extensive engineering testing and certification which would significantly increase cost and result in required deliverable dates not being achieved. Delivery of the initial eighty-five Ethernet appliances is required 8 weeks after contract award. The additional twenty Ethernet appliances will be required 8 weeks after the option is awarded. All deliveries will be made to the Receiving Officer, Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City FL 32407.</p>
<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested offeror(s) wishing to qualify items for future procurements may submit request(s) for qualification, via e-mail, to Contract Specialist, Otis Nattiel, at otis.nattiel@navy.mil. Requests must be marked with this synopsis designation number and should include the offeror's name, address, telephone number, commercial and government entity (CAGE) code, point of contact, and clearly identify the offeror's product and product capabilities.

activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate
source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification
procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having
jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requires
Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight

      Solicitation Number:       VA245-16-B-0049
      Notice Type:       		Pre-solicitation
     
 Synopsis:

      The Department of Veterans Affairs has need for a general construction contractor to provide all labor, materials, and equipment as necessary to expand a new parking structure on the north side of the Washington, DC Medical Center, Main campus located in lot 2A. The existing structure levels B2, B1, and Ground provides approximately 327 parking spaces.  This building is adjacent to the Emergency Department and Primary Care entrances at the Washington, DC VA Medical Center.

The construction of additional levels on top of the existing parking structure continues the process of aligning parking on campus for patient and visitors and closing the parking gap. The existing structure levels B2, B1, and Ground provides approximately 327 parking spaces. Additional levels (2nd, 3rd, 4th ) on top of the existing (B2, B1, Ground) parking structure will further consolidates surface parking to the existing structure and as a result will limit the level of overall traffic circulating deeper within the medical center campus. The Expand Visitor/ Patient Parking Garage Phase 1 project vertical expansion will be constructed on top of the existing, recently completed (2013), standalone precast parking garage.

The Expand Visitor/ Patient Parking Garage Phase 1 project vertical expansion shall add approximately 310 parking spaces including the appropriate number of additional accessible spaces required by the latest VA guidelines.

The construction of the Expand Visitor/ Patient Parking Garage Phase 1 project will require the Contractor to take all necessary precautions when making connections to the current/existing parking garage structure and systems to protect and provide a seamless transition.

This is a Pre-solicitation only. Interested contractors should watch for the issuance of the solicitation which will have specific instructions and requirements associated with this procurement. The tentative date for issuing the solicitation is on or after February 24, 2015 with a bid response date approximately 30 days after the issue date of the solicitation.

<DESC><p><strong>ICE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR DHS PREA AUDITING SERVICES</strong><br /><strong><br />Project Title: </strong><br />Auditing Services RFI PREA Audits 2016 <br /><strong><br />Description:</strong><br />The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is conducting market research to make appropriate acquisition decisions and to gain knowledge of potential qualified contractors interested in and capable of performing the work.<br />ICE is seeking information from companies who have the capability and experience to conduct audits of all eligible ICE detention facilities, ICE holding facilities, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) holding facilities to assess facility compliance with the United States Department of Homeland Security Final Rule, 6 CFR Part 115, ICEB-2012-0003; RIN 1653-AA65, Standards to Prevent, Detect, and Respond to Sexual Abuse and Assault in Confinement Facilities (March 7, 2014). This regulation may be viewed at:<br />https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-03-07/pdf/2014-04675.pdf<br /><br /><strong>Background</strong><br /><br />The ICE Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) is responsible for detaining aliens pending immigration proceedings or removal from the country. CBP maintains holding facilities for individual being processed and waiting for disposition by another agency. In March 2014, DHS published standards pursuant to the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA), establishing robust safeguards against sexual abuse or assault of individuals in DHS custody. These standards prescribe a wide range of requirements for DHS long term detention facilities and holding facilities with regard to preventing and responding to incidents of sexual abuse or assault, including with respect to screening, staff training, detainee education, reporting, coordinated response, medical and mental health care, investigation, and data monitoring. Under the regulation, each DHS long term detention facility covered by the PREA standards must be audited at least once every three years, and each holding facility housing detainees overnight must be audited within three years of July 6, 2015. Holding facilities deemed by this initial audit to be "low risk" (found fully compliant with standards) must subsequently be audited at least once every five years and all other holding facilities at least once every three years. The number of long term detention facilities to be audited will increase gradually over time. Current approximations estimate the vendor would be required to initially complete approximately 174 total PREA audits by July 6, 2018, with expectations but not guarantees that number will increase. <br /><br />This RFI is being used to collect information about capability of qualified contractors to provide auditing services pursuant to the PREA regulations. Auditing tools and methodology are currently under development, but will likely be similar to audit materials used for PREA audits conducted by the Department of Justice (DOJ). Audits will consist of, at a minimum:<br /><br />&bull; Review of policies, procedures, reports, internal and external audits, and accreditations for each facility type<br />&bull; Review of a sampling of relevant documents and other records and information (including any available videotapes or other electronic data)<br />&bull; Observation of all areas of the audited facility<br />&bull; Interviews with representative samples of facility detainees and staff<br />&bull; Solicitation of input from community-based or victim advocates<br />&bull; Verification of facility implementation of any corrective action plan developed for identified deficiencies, and redetermination of facility compliance<br />&bull; Completion and submission of required reports and working papers<br />For additional information about PREA requirements regarding the scope, content, and methodology for audits, please see the attached copy of the excerpted PREA regulations.<br />Contractors should have knowledge of the confinement setting and DHS PREA standards, an understanding of the population, and prior experience conducting audits of confinement facilities. Experience conducting audits under PREA, or other audits related to sexual abuse or assault safeguards, standards or best practices, is preferred. Formal DOJ PREA certification is required for all auditors.<br /><br /><strong>Pursuant to &sect; 115.202(c) of the DHS PREA standards, contractors may not have received financial compensation from DHS within the past three years, except for compensation received from conducting other audits, or other consulting related to detention reform.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Responses</strong><br />Requested information shall be submitted electronically in Microsoft Word for Office 2010 and/or Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 compatible format are due on <strong>March 8, 2016, at 4:00 pm EST. </strong>The total response package shall not exceed 25 pages. Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Kehinde.adesina@ice.dhs.gov and brandiss.smith@ice.dhs.gov : Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. To aid the Government, please segregate proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. Late submissions will not be considered. <br /><br />1. Company name<br />2. Company address<br />3. POC information (name, title, phone number, email address, etc.)<br />4. Company business size<br />5. Socioeconomic status<br />6. Copy of GSA schedule(s) (if applicable)<br />7. Brief Company Capability statement (to include addressing all needs as stated above). Contractors should specify their prior experience or contracts in the area, and whether they possess any formal DOJ PREA certification.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS A RFI ONLY.</span></strong> This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes it does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this announcement, and information submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned. <br /><strong><br />Place of Contract Performance:</strong><br />United States</p>

<DESC><strong><br /><br />INTRODUCTION</strong><br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.
<p>Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The NCI-funded Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (CVT), was a community-based, double-blind, randomized controlled phase III trial of the bivalent GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) vaccine. The study enrolled 7,466 young women between 2004 and 2005 residing in the regions of Guanacaste and Puntarenas, Costa Rica, identified via a census.  The main eligibility requirements were ages between 18-25 years old, good general health, and neither pregnant nor breastfeeding. Women were excluded if they had pre-existing medical conditions that preclude vaccination, had history of hepatitis A or previous vaccination against it, or were unwilling to use contraception during the vaccination period. At the enrollment visit and following informed consent, a risk factor interview was administered, a pelvic examination was performed on sexually experienced women, exfoliated cells were collected in PreservCyt liquid medium for ThinPrep cytologic evaluation and HPV DNA testing, and blood was collected. Then, women were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to receive Cervarix or a "Control" hepatitis A vaccine (HAV arm; modified preparation of Havrix, GSK Biologicals). Both vaccines had identical packaging and were intended to be administered at 0, 1, and 6 months.  Women not vaccinated in the allowable ranges did not receive the dose. Women who became pregnant during the vaccination phase or were referred to colposcopy were deferred; if the vaccination window was missed, then she missed that specific dose.</p>
<p>Women were followed annually for 4 years, or every 6 months if they had low-grade cytologic abnormalities.  At follow-up visits, a risk factor questionnaire was administered, a pelvic exam for cervical cancer screening was performed, and cervical cells and blood were collected. Women with evidence of high-grade disease or with persistent low-grade abnormalities were referred to colposcopy for evaluation and treatment, when needed. <br />Given that some women received fewer than three doses of the assigned vaccine, we were able to investigate the dose-specific vaccine efficacy. We observed that efficacy was similar after four years, regardless of the number of doses received. This study provided the first published efficacy data for fewer than three doses. New published data on reduced-dose protection has come from immunogenicity studies, which support the Costa Rica findings.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES </strong></p>
<p>The requirements of this new prospective contract are related to NCI's HPV vaccine evaluation efforts required for the next phase of this HPV vaccine research in Costa Rica, and will cover two projects: 1) transition of women in from the original Costa Rica HPV Vaccine Trial into either an additional follow-up phase or completion of study and 2) planning for a new trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy of 1 versus 2 doses of the HPV vaccines.</p>
<p>Additional work is needed to finalize participation for the subset of participants who are not in the follow-up research group of interest, and transition those who will continue to be studied in the next phase of the research which will explore the durability of vaccine protection beyond 10 years. Further, because the Costa Rica HPV Vaccine Trial showed similar HPV vaccine efficacy over four years among women who received one, two and three doses of the HPV16/18 vaccine, and stable antibody responses have been observed throughout the seven years of follow-up accrued to date in CVT, following up on these discoveries and further documenting the protection afforded by fewer doses could result in a monumental, global public health breakthrough.  Thus, the second component of the study involves the planning phase of a new trial that will directly evaluate the protection afforded by single-dose and two- dose regimens of the prophylactic HPV vaccines.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS </strong></p>
<p>Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, as needed to perform the following activities as specified by the NCI Contracting Officer Representative (COR) to conduct the Transition of the women participating of the Human Papillomavirus Type 16 Vaccine Trial in Costa Rica to extended follow-up or exiting the study and prepare for the implementation of the One-dose trial.</p>

<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background:  Since 1958, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) has been a major research program conducted by the National Institute on Aging (NIA).  The BLSA is a multi- disciplinary study of physiologic and psychological aspects of normal aging in community-dwelling men and women.  Active BLSA participants are volunteers who visit the Clinical Unit of the NIA-IRP in Baltimore, MD for testing every 1 to 4 years.  Since 1994, we have been conducting a longitudinal brain imaging study of selected older adults in the BLSA to characterize individual differences in longitudinal brain changes, to investigate the extent to which these brain changes underlie individual differences in cognitive aging, to identify brain changes that may be predictors of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, and to assess the impact of potential modulators of brain and cognitive aging.  As of December, 2015, more than 2960 neuroimaging evaluations (N=2960) have been performed for BLSA participants.  As part of this research program, it has also been necessary to develop and validate sophisticated tools for analysis of longitudinal neuroimaging data that can be applied in large-scale studies.  Thus, this project has involved the development, validation, and refinement of novel image analysis tools and the application of these new tools to longitudinal volumetric MR imaging scans and measures of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) measures of regional cerebral blood flow and amyloid deposition in brain.  More recently, these tools include advanced machine learning approaches using pattern analysis to classify clinical status of individuals based on structural and functional brain images.  More than 150 publications have resulted from the work of the initial phases of this study.</p>
<p>The work of this requirement will continue to focus on the development of sophisticated tools and quantitative analysis of longitudinal structural MRI data acquired from BLSA participants.  This project will continue to provide important information for researchers and clinicians on age changes in brain structure, their associations with cognitive change, and factors that modulate these associations, including risk factors for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease as well as factors that promote the maintenance of cognitive health.  Through the use of the existing physical and psychological data for BLSA participants collected over many years, this project will provide unique insights into our understanding of early predictors and the temporal sequence of individual differences in the rate of neuroanatomic, neurophysiologic and cognitive aging.  These neuroimaging data will also provide important normative data, including the frequency and extent of brain abnormalities in community-dwelling individuals, from which to evaluate pathological aging.</p>
<p>While a number of studies have shown that structural and functional longitudinal changes in specific temporal lobe regions predict cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, BLSA studies have shown that using networks of information throughout the brain via advance methods of pattern analysis provide greater sensitivity and specificity to predict who is likely to develop cognitive impairment and dementia and who is likely to remain healthy1, 2.  Thus, the proposed contract will require methods that show longitudinal consistency of measures of global and regional brain volumes and ischemic lesion volumes, including consistency with MR data acquired during earlier phases of this project (since 1994).  This Contract will also require the application and continued development of sophisticated analytic approaches, including machine learning and pattern analysis methods, to allow classification of risk for cognitive impairment on an individual subject basis.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: The NIA requires the Contractor to provide sophisticated quantitative analysis of structural MR imaging data, including MR images already acquired (N = 2960) and new MRI data with approximately 300 new MR datasets collected each year of the proposed contract.  The proposed contract will include more recently acquired MR images from the sample of approximately 70 active BLSA neuroimaging study participants from our original sample age 55 and older (imaging begun in 1994) and will add image analysis of more recently acquired data from the NIA 3T MRI facility, including younger BLSA participants.  The addition of comparable MRI data from younger participants as part of routine BLSA visits and expansion of the MR imaging sample will allow investigation of age-related changes throughout adulthood.</p>
<p>Overall Project Requirements: The proposed contract will require analysis of MR images provided by the Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience, Intramural Research Program, NIA.  The Contractor shall be required to develop an imaging pipeline and perform quantitative analysis of MP-RAGE T1 weighted volumetric scans, double echo scans (3 mm proton density/T2-weighted), and 3 mm FLAIR acquisitions (sequence details below) to provide measures of intracranial volumes, whole brain, gray matter, white matter, and regional brain volumes using a multi-atlas labelling approach based on a validated approach to region definition.  The Contractor shall use these imaging data in combination to provide the NIA-LBN with measures of normal and abnormal tissue volumes throughout the brain.  (For context, additional imaging scans collected for these participants include Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), resting state functional MR (fMR), task-related fMR, and positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid imaging in a subset of participants, but analysis of these additional scans is not part of the current acquisition.)</p>
<p>The principal goal of this procurement is the quantitative analysis of longitudinal MRI data to provide measures of brain structure in BLSA participants.  Specifically, the primary objectives are to continue to address the following questions:</p>
<p>&bull;	What are the rates and regional distribution of changes in brain anatomy in non-demented men and women throughout adulthood?</p>
<p>&bull;	What is the frequency and progression of brain abnormalities in older adults and what is the clinical significance of these findings for cognitive aging?</p>
<p>&bull;	Against a background of age-related changes in brain structure, which changes predict cognitive impairment and dementia, and conversely, what are the predictors of the maintenance of cognitive health?</p>
<p>&bull;	What factors modulate cognitive and brain aging and how do they impact brain-behavior associations?</p>
<p><br />Scope of Work: Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide all the necessary personnel, facilities, supplies and service to perform the following requirements:</p>
<p>A.	General Requirement:  The Contractor shall be responsible for image processing and quantitation of 2960 brain MR scans acquired previously, the majority on the NIA 3T Philips MR scanner, as well as approximately 300 scans to be acquired on an annual basis using the same imaging protocols.  The image processing must be consistent with methods used in earlier phases of the BLSA neuroimaging study to allow longitudinal consistency of data analysis.</p>
<p>B.	Specific Requirements: The purpose of acquiring structural MR images is twofold - 1.  to provide information on regional brain structure and 2. to localize regions of interest for the quantitation of PET studies, where analysis of PET scan data is performed in the NIA LBN. Therefore, image analysis must include the following:</p>
<p>1.	Differentiation and quantification of brain volumes and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF);<br />2.	Differentiation and quantification of gray and white matter volumes; <br />3.	Definition and quantification of cortical and subcortical regions; <br />4.	Quantification of lesion volumes, including infarcts and periventricular hyperintensities, labeled templates of brain regions for registration and overlay on PET images for regional definition</p>
<p>The following imaging series shall be used for analysis of normal and abnormal tissue volumes:</p>
<p>&bull;	A 3-dimensional volumetric MPRAGE scan - (sagittal acquisition - TR: 6.8ms; TE: 3.1ms, MATRIX: 256X256, SLICES: 170; PIXEL SIZE: 1.1 X 1.1; SLICE THICKNESS = 1.0; FOV: 240)</p>
<p>&bull;	A 3 mm double echo series - (axial acquisition - TR: 3000ms; TE: 8.0/100 ms; MATRIX: 256 x 218; SLICES: 50; PIXEL SIZE: 0.94 x 0.96; SLICE THICKNESS: 3mm; FOV: 240)</p>
<p>&bull;	A 3 mm FLAIR series- (TR: 11000/ TI 2800; TE: 68; MATRIX: 288 X 266; SLICES: 50; PIXEL SIZE:  0.83 X 0.90; SLICE THICKNESS: 3MM; FOV: 240)</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />Quantitative Image Analysis:</p>
<p>Both regional analysis and voxel-based analysis of MR image data shall be performed.  Volumetric analysis of MR data shall involve removal of extracranial material, cerebellum, and brainstem inferior to the mammillary bodies, tissue classification of remaining material, stereotaxic transformation to the Talairach or other standard atlas, and regional definition.  The validated approaches for all phases of the analysis employed for image processing of BLSA data shall be employed and any proposed changes to image quantification procedures must be validated against the original analytic methods to ensure the longitudinal integrity of the data.  In particular, nonlinear registration of images shall be performed, the RAVENS4 approach shall be used for determination of tissue volumes and creation of gray matter, white matter, CSF and lesion maps, and the procedure detailed by Lao et al5 shall be used for lesion quantification. In addition, this procurement requires application of the current suite of software developed, validated, and maintained by the Section on Biomedical Image Analysis (SBIA), Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania as this suite of software has been developed and optimized on BLSA longitudinal neuroimaging data, of BLSA neuroimaging research program since its inception in 1993.</p>
<p>A training set of MR images shall be maintained, which will be used to establish and maintain inter-operator reliability and longitudinal consistency of the processed data.<br />Longitudinal analysis of imaging data:  <br />The BLSA neuroimaging study requires novel approaches to analysis that account for the longitudinal nature of the BLSA MR imaging data.  Novel methods that maximize the consistency and accuracy of longitudinal data across scanners and over time are required.  These methods may include methods for 4-dimensional image analysis, incorporating information in the temporal as well as spatial dimension, to obtain accurate estimates of very subtle longitudinal changes during normal aging and accelerated changes associated with cognitive impairment.6 Alternatively, multi-atlas labelling approaches may be used to enhance longitudinal stability and obtain more accurate estimates of rates of brain changes. Of particular importance is the modeling of abrupt changes in imaging contrast and noise introduced by scanner or protocol changes.  The Contractor shall provide estimates of global and regional tissue volumes, incorporating these new approaches to enhance the ability to detect subtle longitudinal changes.   <br />Classification of images using multi-modal imaging data:<br />The BLSA acquires multi-modality imaging data that reflect complex spatiotemporal aspects of brain anatomy in individuals who maintain cognitive health as they age and in those who develop cognitive impairment.  This procurement requires the application of advanced imaging pattern analysis methods that predict an individual's risk for cognitive impairment on an individual subject basis.  Examples of the approach used previously in the BLSA include the SPARE-AD2  and SPARE-CD7 indices as individualized predictive markers of AD and mild cognitive impairment, as well as of cognitive decline in cognitively normal older adults. The Contractor shall provide SPARE-AD scores for MR images analyzed in this contract.</p>
<p>Data Security:  The Contractor shall provide a data security plan to ensure the confidentiality of participant information and the integrity of all data collected under this contract.<br />Replication, Dissemination or Use of Results:  Data will be used by members of the NIA to examine the relation between changes in brain structure and function with normal aging and changes in neuropsychological performance.  All data collected under this contract shall be forwarded to the NIA and a copy will be stored at the NIA.  Results will be disseminated to the scientific community via presentations at scientific meetings and publications in professional journals.  Collaboration of the Contractor principal and co-principal investigators with NIA Investigators in data analyses and reporting of study results will be encouraged.  The Contractor is prohibited from publishing or disseminating information from work performed under this contract without prior written approval from the COR, in accordance with HHSAR 352.224-70, Confidentiality of Information. The confidentiality of information collected from BLSA participants is protected under the Privacy Act, as described in the Federal Register, Vol 53., No. 225, Tuesday, November 22, 1988, pp. 47313-4.

Further, the Agency will not accept unsolicited proposals. Potential offerors having the skills, capabilities and bonding requirements necessary to perform the described project work are invited to provide feedback via email to Vicki Supler at vicki.supler@wdc.usda.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with M Squared Lasers, Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts for the purchase of a Laser Sum Frequency Generation System under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106(1)(b).
<p>NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) Electron Physics Group (EPG) requires the purchase of a continuous-wave laser sum-frequency generation system able to produce single-frequency, tunable laser light at a wavelength of 323 nm. The laser light from this system will be used as a first step in the photoionization of cold lithium atoms as part of a cold atom ion source. This ion source is being built by the CNST as a modification to a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIBSEM) system in order to realize a high brightness nanometer-scale focused ion beam of lithium ions. This beam will be used for research on lithium ion battery materials as part of CNST's mission to develop new nanoscale measurement capabilities in support of users in the user facility.</p>
<p>M Squared Lasers, Inc., is the only vendor in the commercial marketplace capable of producing a laser generation system that can provide for a sum-frequency generation function. It is the only system has the sum-frequency function incorporated into its product.</p>
<p>Therefore, M Squared Lasers, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide the required Continuous-Wave Laser Sum-Frequency Generation System.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334413, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on February 23, 2016. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to cory.worley@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

Within these lines, there are six common focus areas: Transition, Special Populations, Place-Based Strategy, Digital Media, Economic Development, and Skills and Education.  
The contract type has not yet determined  This requirement will be either a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract or a hybrid Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) and Time and Material Contract for Professional services covering a 5 year period of performance, inclusive of options .  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code(s) for this requirement is 624310, which has a size standard $11 Million.

<RESPDATE>022216
<CONTACT>Desiree C. Harris, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014584629, Email huq9@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Illumina, Inc., 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, CA 92122 for lab supplies of TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT( full listing will be attached). This requirement is determine to be sole source as these supplies are required to global gene (mRNA and miRNA) expression profile by next generation sequencing (NGS) in biological samples such as rat blood and lungs. NGS is the best technique currently available to determine global gene expression profile in biological specimens including blood samples. Depletion of globin mRNA from total RNA is an absolute requirement to obtain accurate global gene expression profile in blood samples by NGS. The TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT - (with Ribo-Zero Globin) - Set A and Set B are specifically designed by Illumina, Inc, to deplete globin mRNA from blood total RNA while preparing the libraries required for NGS. TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT - (with Ribo-Zero Globin) - Set A and Set B, sold by the vendor (Illumina, Inc,), is the only commercially available product with capability to simultaneously deplete globin mRNA while preparing sequencing library. Other commercially available kits can either deplete globin mRNA from RNA samples or prepare the sequencing library - not both. Performing globin mRNA depletion and library preparation using separate kits is more time consuming and expensive. This will also require more quantity of blood samples to obtain the quantity of RNA required to deplete globin mRNA and prepare sequencing libraries for NGS. Since blood yields only limited quantity of globin-free RNA, it is important to use a kit that requires the least quantity of RNA to prepare libraries required for global gene expression profiling by NGS. Using kits other than those requested in this purchase order will require using substantially more quantity of blood samples to isolate the amount of RNA to prepare sequencing libraries and this, in turn, will require the use of more number of animals in our experiments. The TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT - (with Ribo-Zero Gold) - Set A and Set B are required to determine global gene expression profile of lung samples. Using kits from the same vendor (Illumina, Inc) will facilitate accurate comparison of the data obtained from the blood and lung samples of the experimental<br />animals used in the same study. This will also make interpretation of the findings scientifically more<br />valid. The sequencing libraries prepared will be sent to the CDC Genomics Core Facility to<br />determine global gene expression profile by NGS. The CDC Core Facility uses an Illumina Hi-Seq<br />machine to sequence samples. The TrueSeq SBS Kit v3 - HS (50 cycles) and TruSeq PE Cluster<br />Kit v3 - cBot -HS are the only reagents that are compatible with the Hi-Seq sequencing machine to<br />determine global gene expression profile by NGS.
<p>This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within fifteen (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to Desiree Harris; contract specialist at huq9@cdc.gov by COB February 22, 2016 @ 3:00pm EST.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NICHD-16-021 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-86. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 518210 and the business size standard is $32.5m. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intend to procure on a sole source basis with SecondHelix of Alexandria, VA to tailored keyword searches on social media and content analysis on the social media data using a machine learning approach. The begin date of service will be on or around March 1, 2016 for a performance period of five months from begin date and vendor location is the place of performance. See Attached S.O.W.<br />Specifically, SecondHelix will use keyword searched such as smoking and tobacco for relevant tweets during January 1, 2009 through October 15, 2015. SecondHelix will download all the relevant tweets related to the research topic. SecondHelix will randomly sample some percent of the tweets (depending on the total number of tweets), review them and develop a coding scheme to classify these tweets in different themes and subthemes. SecondHelix will then write a computer-based algorithm so that a computer can do the classification. SecondHelix will randomly sample a percent of tweets to see if the algorithm is correct and sensitive. If algorithm is not correct and sensitive then SecondHelix will revise the algorithm, however if correct a computer will do all the subsequent coding. SecondHelix is the only known source available that fit the needs of the lab. SecondHelix offers tailored keywords searches on social media and content analysis on the social media data using a machine learning approach, which enable the lab to analyze millions of social media data points. In addition, SecondHelix unique expertise in managing and analyzing Twitter data and their ability to integrate geographical data into the Twitter data is vital to the lab research requirements. Also, SecondHelix offers the service to integrate social media data with geographical information, which is essential to the lab research. SecondHelix specific experience and knowledge in this area are critical to the lab research initiative. <br />The lab wants to understand the social discussions about tobacco and its disparities because these discussions shape public opinions and perceptions. In the past (prior to social media) it was impossible to capture these discussions in large scales, now with social media the lab can acquire this information. It is essential to examine social media because behavioral theories post that social environment is influential to individuals behaviors. The lab wants to understand how the public discuss tobacco and its disparities. The insight to be gain can help us better understand the social environment and guide the lab in examining whether the public discussions need to be changed to create a more supportive environment for disadvantaged smokers to quit smoking, which is the research goal of the lab.<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of the 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR 6.302. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer. The provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions applies to this acquisition.

<p><strong><br />ACQUISITION AUTHORITY</strong> <br />This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and IS NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000.00).  	<br />The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-86-2, dated February 1, 2016. The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through this date. <br /><strong><br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducting research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders and stroke. The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. <br /> <br />The NINDS Sleep Laboratory is a part of the Electroencephalography (EEG) Section, which is part of the Office of the Clinical Director, NINDS.  Its mission is two-fold: 1) to provide clinical diagnostic and therapeutic sleep studies to patients participating in research protocols at the NIH Clinical Center, and 2) to provide research support to intramural investigators in developing and carrying out research protocols related to sleep and sleep disorders, including protocol development, obtaining and interpreting sleep and EEG recordings, and designing appropriate testing protocols and outcomes.<br /><br />At least 40 million Americans each year suffer from chronic, long-term sleep disorders, and an additional 20 million experience occasional sleep problems. These disorders and the resulting sleep deprivation interfere with cognition, rehabilitation, work, driving, and social activities. They also account for an estimated $16 billion in medical costs each year, while the indirect costs due to lost productivity and other factors are probably much greater. In addition to primary sleep disorders, many neurologic, psychiatric and other medical diseases have associated sleep disturbances, many of which can be managed effectively once they are correctly diagnosed.<br /><br /><strong>Purpose</strong><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to provide the NINDS EEG Section, under the Office of the Clinical Director, with professional consulting support services to assist in the analysis and interpretation of polysomnographic studies, as well as in providing technical expertise to assist intramural investigators with study design and outcome measures in the protocols investigating sleep or sleep disorders.<br /><br /><strong>Project Requirements</strong><br />The Contractor shall provide the following professional consulting support services:</p>

<p>Our department performs numerous High Throughput Assays annually. The key step of any high throughput assay is the addition of reagents into a micro-well plate. The Tox21 Robotic Screening system relies on this equipment because of its flexibility and reliability of liquid dispensing within our laboratories. Tox21 is an effort to use the quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) approach to profile a collection of 10,000 compounds composed of environmental chemicals and drugs approved for human and animal use against a battery of cellular and biochemical assays for their potential to perturb biological pathways that may result in toxicity. Such a data set could be used to create a systematic view of the biological network and the interactions therein via its response to chemical perturbations. To achieve this goal, a set of assays needs to be selected or designed to measure targets that encompass all pathways that are relevant to toxicity.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire an Automated BioRAPTR FRD Workstation</p>
<p>Purchase Description<br />Specifically, the NCATS requires the following:</p>

SECTION D  CONTRACT DOCUMENTS, EXHIBITS, OR ATTACHMENTS
 
D.1  IT CONTRACT SECURITY (MARCH 12, 2010)
VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY
GENERAL

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS

A contractor/subcontrator shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.

All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.

Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS).  Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.

Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.

The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ.  The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.

VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE

Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data
- General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).

VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements.  VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.

Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization.  Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.

The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies.  If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.

The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state.  If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.

If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold  payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.

If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements.  Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.

The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.

The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.

Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval.  The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.

Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus.  If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.

For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.

TRAINING

All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:

Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the  Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;

Successfully complete the VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior
training and annually complete required security training;

Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training; and

Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document - e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.]

The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COTR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.

Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

<p>Closed-end or pre-coded questions:  The Contractor shall use the codes specified on the final questionnaire for all items.</p>
<p>Open-end questions:  The Contractor will develop categories of responses based on 200 randomly selected questionnaires from all regions of the sample, providing at least 5 sample responses for each proposed category.   Categories must be approved by the Client prior to coding responses.</p>
<p>The "Other" category should not include more than 10% of the total responses for any question.  If any single response in the "Other" category amounts to more than 2%, then the Contractor will code this response as a separate response, not as "Other."</p>

Include a brief explanation of how interviewing and fieldwork procedures affected the theoretical margin of error.</p>
<p>9)	Selected contact sheets for 10 specific interviewers which the Client will specify after receipt of the final data set.  These may be sent either in hard copy or as a scanned email attachment;</p>
<p>10)	Ten completed questionnaires which the Client will specify after receipt of the final data set (either in hard copy or as a scanned email attachment);</p>
<p>11)	The Client may request additional supporting documentation to fully understand the design and conduct of the survey (e.g., interviewer maps).</p>
<p><br /><strong>TIME SCHEDULE:</strong> Each stage of the survey project should be conducted according to a schedule agreed to by the Contractor and the Office of Opinion Research.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><strong>CONFIDENTIALITY:</strong> The study is to be conducted in the name of the Contractor, in keeping with standard industry practice. The Client's identity shall not be revealed to field supervisors, interviewers or respondents in order to minimize bias.  Further, the Client's identity, details of the project and the survey results shall not be revealed to outside parties - e.g., media, academic or government - at any point before, during or after completion of the project without the express written permission of the Client.<br /> <br /><br /><strong>ARCHIVING OF STUDY:</strong> The Client may store parts of the study (questionnaires, data set, methodological summary) with a non-profit archive (e.g., the Roper Center, the National Archive and Records Administration).  Projects will be embargoed for at least two years, and all identifiable markers of the Contractor will be removed.</p>
<p><br /><strong>BILLING AND PAYMENT: </strong> Payment is typically authorized either in a single installment upon receipt and approval of all required deliverables, OR in two installments - the first upon approval of the final questionnaire and sampling plan, and the second upon receipt and approval of all required deliverables.  Please note, payment cannot be authorized upon commissioning the survey.  All payments will be made in U.S. dollars.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amendment 02 - February 8, 2016</span></strong>
<p>Due to a lack of accommodations and meeting space during the previously stated "preferred dates", as evidenced by a lack of quote submissions, the Department is amending the RFQ to add two additional sets of preferred dates. Accordingly, the solicitation is amended to add May 6-8, 2016 and May 13-15, 2016 as preferred dates. Quotes are due 2pm EST on February 11, 2016. Please submit any questions as soon as possible.</p>
<span><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amendment 01 - January 27, 2016<br /></span></strong></span>Multiple interested parties have asked if there is flexibility with the stated preferred dates. &nbsp;Accordingly, the solicitation is amended to state that preferred dates are April 8-10, 2016 or April 15-17, 2016. We will also consider April 22-24, 2016. &nbsp;End of Amendment 01.<br /><br /><br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation for commercial services is being conducted in conjunction with FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation OCO-EMS2016-0001 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-85-1. The NAICS Code is 721110, Hotels (Not Casino) and Motels, and small business size standard is $32.5M.
<p><br />The U.S. Department of Education (ED) has a requirement to obtain meeting space and hotel guest room accommodations for a conference hosted by the Office of the Secretary in April 2016.</p>
<p><br />The firm selected to receive an offer from the Department is required to register in the System for Award Management (SAM) and to maintain active registration during the life of the purchase order. SAM can be accessed at https://www.sam.gov. Firms shall include their DUNS number in their quote. If the firm does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. The firm selected for an offer from the Department will need to provide Offeror Representations and Certifications prior to any award.</p>
<p>The Government will not execute any contract other than with the facility or venue proposed to hold the event and provide accommodations. Any quote from a source other than the hotel or lodging venue itself must include written evidence that the offeror is currently authorized to submit binding quotes on behalf of the venue whose accommodations and/or facility are being offered. Evidence shall include a signed agreement between the vendor and the offeror. Quotes that fail to provide such evidence shall be deemed technically unacceptable and will not be considered for award. Any quote which requires the Government to make an offer that renders a hotel or facility provider as a third party or for lodging/hotel accommodations that cannot be provided at offeror's facility shall be deemed technically unacceptable and will not be considered for award.</p>
<p><br />PLEASE SEE THE COMPLETE RFQ UPLOADED AS A SEPARATE DOCUMENT FOR COMPLETE REQUIREMENTS, BASIS FOR AWARD, AND COMPLETE QUOTE INSTRUCTIONS.</p>

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict.

The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

_____________________________________________________________________________________

This OFFICIAL synopsis/solicitation is for a firm-fixed-price multiple-award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) enterprise contract to satisfy an ongoing need at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) enterprise level to procure or lease Multifunctional Devices (MFDs).  This will fulfill VA's printing, copying, and scanning needs (including installation, configuration, training, and standard one-year commercial warranty support and maintenance) by offering eight unique MFD configurations for purchase or lease.  This acquisition is required in order to provide VA organizations with an efficient means of replacing and/or refreshing its MFD inventory that is at or approaching its end-of-life.  Establishment of a multiple-award ID/IQ enterprise vehicle will enable any VA organization to quickly and efficiently acquire current generation MFDs to meet its minimum MFD requirements.  

The IDIQ contract will consist of a single 2-year ordering period.  This will be a competitive acquisition and a 100% Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside.  VA intends to make up to three awards and reserves the right to make additional awards if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  

The NAICS code for this procurement is anticipated to be 334118.  The solicitation number assigned to this effort is VA118-16-R-0978 (previously issued as a Request For Information under ID# VA118-15-N-0225 and cancelled solicitation #VA118-15-R-0257, VA118-15-R-0395 and VA118-16-R-0882).  The closing date is February 11, 2016 at 10:00AM EST.  The Point of Contact for this effort is Samantha Fletcher, Contract Specialist, Phone 732-440-9652, Email:  samantha.fletcher@va.gov.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. The United States Air Force Engine Component Improvement Program (AFLCMC/LPAK) is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement for Component Improvement and Testing of the F107 engine used on the USAF Air Launched Cruise Missiles. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541712.
<p>The Air Force anticipates a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract will be awarded. The Air Force anticipates a twelve-month Period of Performance (POP) on the base contract with possible three (3) or four (4) one-year options. The projected base year period of performance is 01 July 2016. The Air Force anticipates this acquisition will utilize procedures outlined in FAR Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541712, size standard 1000 employees. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their SAM. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package. The capabilities package may include a 4-8 page capabilities document, 12 -size font in Times New Roman, Calibri, Arial, or Cambria. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided, including whether this experience was as a prime or subprime contractor, whether it was in support of a Government or commercial contract and what the scope of the experience was. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Interested contractors will clearly explain how they intend to meet the stated requirements, including the requirement they possess the necessary government clearance levels to work in the nuclear weapon community. Your statement of capabilities should include the following: Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; and Small business size certification if applicable. Please submit one (1) electronic copy of your response to Mitchell J. Frost at mitchell.frost@us.af.mil. Statements should be submitted no later than 12 February, 2016 by 11 a.m. EST. The Government will endeavor to answer any questions interested parties may have. All questions must be submitted in writing to Mitchell Frost at mitchell.frost@us.af.mil or Christopher Pluskota at christopher.pluskota@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a solicitation will be published and posted on the FedBizOpps website.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, you may contact Mitchell Frost at mitchell.frost@us.af.mil or Christopher Pluskota at <a href="mailto:christopher.pluskota@us.af.mil">christopher.pluskota@us.af.mil</a>.&nbsp; Mrs. Jill Willingham-Allen, AFLCMC/AQP, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433, has been appointed as Ombudsman to hear concerns from offerors, or potential offerors, during the proposal development.

See PWS paragraph 1.2.2.</p>
<p>4. Describe your approach to performing maintenance of AAF responsible aircraft IAW PWS paragraph 3.2.4.</p>
<p>5. Remobilization. Since Afghanistan is an unstable environment there is the possibility that the contractor would have to relocate to another base during the contract period.

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">***Please see body of text below for complete Reference #11.&nbsp; 02/08/2016******</span></strong><br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. <br /><br />The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), is seeking information on a potential requirement for "Clinical Decision Support for Working Patients with Diabetes Mellitus in a Primary Care Clinical Setting."<br /><br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the NAICS code 541990 for the potential acquisition. Responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DRAFT Sample Work Statement (subject to change);</strong></span><br /><br />Project Objective<br /><br />To evaluate the implementation, use, and perceived value of integrated clinical decision support (CDS) in a primary care setting that addresses management of diabetes mellitus in patient work environments.<br /><br />&bull; To assess the usefulness of the CDS to clinicians (herein defined as primary care providers and other clinical staff), patients, and the healthcare organization<br />&bull; To assess ease of use, tolerability of the CDS<br />&bull; To improve the CDS based on lessons learned<br />&bull; To assess changes in attitudes and behavior of clinicians in response to the CDS over time, in order to determine if favorable changes are sustained over time; for example:<br />o Changes in the perceived relationship between work and health among clinicians before and during the availability of the CDS<br />o Changes in use of occupational information in clinical practice (beyond diabetes) before and during the availability of the CDS<br />&bull; To assess patient receptiveness to receiving information about the impact of their work environment on their health management, in order to improve their care<br />&bull; To assess changes in patient HbA1c levels before and during the availability of the CDS (if feasible)<br />&bull; To assess the impact of the CDS on patient behaviors<br /><br /><strong>Background<br /></strong><br />This project aims to demonstrate the value and meaningful use of occupational information in electronic health records (EHRs) by providing clinical decision support (CDS) to clinicians to facilitate their recognition of the interface of work and health. EHR systems use CDS applications/tools to provide care providers and other clinical staff, patients, and/or other individuals with knowledge to enhance health and health care. Standardized data, including data from a person's occupational history, can be used to trigger delivery of information relevant to care. To date there has been no systematic assessment of the feasibility and usefulness of delivering clinical information linked to work through the EHR.</p>
<p>A major challenge to CDS software developers is how to convert clinical knowledge, such as treatment guidelines, into a computer interpretable format. To address this challenge and to accomplish our goals, NIOSH is using a stepwise approach which uses a four-stage or four-layered framework. The bottom layer expresses the knowledge in broad narrative language and higher layers increasingly adding more technical structured detail focused on a specific clinical context and EHR. The occupationally relevant knowledge and logic (bottom layers) is provided in the Diabetes_and_Work_Environment_CDS_Knowledge document and the work reflected herein is to demonstrate its usability and usefulness within a specific clinical setting (higher layers). Dissemination of the knowledge gained by this work will target a variety of audiences ranging from EHR policy makers to producers and users of EHRs. The HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) drives the implementation of certified EHRs in the U.S. and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) provide substantive financial incentives for meaningful use of EHRs through regulatory channels. Disseminating the results of this work to health care entities, EHR and CDS vendors, and researchers studying the application of health information technology (HIT) will build support for broader use of this and similar CDS relating health and work in EHRs. <br /><br />The target population for this study is primary care practitioners, who often are faced with caring for patients whose work environment impacts their health management. Patients spend a significant portion of their day at their workplace and therefore comprehensive and coordinated care requires consideration of work-related factors. A key aspect of healthcare improvement through the use of HIT is the delivery of knowledge via the EHR to educate and advise patients and clinicians on clinical management options. CDS tools supply clinicians, patients, or other individuals with knowledge to enhance health and health care. Standardized data, including data from a person's occupational history, can be used to trigger user-friendly delivery of information relevant to care, such as clinical guidelines. The content can be intelligently filtered using person-specific information and presented at appropriate times during the clinical care process. Educating patients and clinicians about work-related risk factors at the time of care will reinforce prevention and promote better care of working patients.<br /><br />Diabetes is an example of a chronic disease for which work environment factors can impact disease management. Among all workers, age 18 or older, 4% reported ever being told by a health care provider they have diabetes and among adults aged 44-64, 13.7% have either diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes. Davila et al. found that adults working over 40 hours per week were more likely to have suboptimal glycemic control (HbA1c level) compared to those working 20 hours or less and hypothesized that factors such as time constraints and the negative impact of shift work on diet could explain these findings. Also, physical activity levels, both work-related and leisure-time, vary considerably across occupations and may contribute to achieving optimal glycemic control. Finally, a number of studies have systematically examined the efficacy of EHRs and CDS to improve diabetic control and have found that these can contribute to positive changes in clinician performance and glycemic control, especially among patients who previously had greater difficulty with control. It is possible that the work environment could be one of the contributing factors to poorer control. The American Diabetic Association has created guidelines to assist physicians regarding disability and work accommodations for their diabetic patients.<br /><br /><strong>Scope</strong><br /><br />The contractor is to evaluate the viability of using work information to improve clinical management in a primary care setting, based on performance measures and, if possible, on health outcomes. The contractor is to apply information from the Diabetes_and_Work_Environment_CDS_Knowledge document to clinical decision support (CDS) in a primary care clinical entity and evaluate the use and attitudes by clinicians (herein defined as primary care providers and other clinic staff) over time.</p>
<p>The contractor is to structure the information and logic to address each patient encounter, based on the description in the knowledge document and their knowledge of primary care settings. The principles for this work are described in Mardon et al (ref. 11). The detailed, semi-structured model of the information and decision logic for the selected application that is present in the Diabetes_and_Work_Environment_CDS_Knowledge document and as modified by the contractor, is to be converted into a structured, computer-usable language model consistent with required EHR system standards. The contractor is to prepare the model with the correct technical terminology (i.e., HIT vocabulary codes) and CDS software standards. This structured model is to incorporate data standards and technical requirements that are independent of site-specific considerations such that it potentially could be used in most EHR systems.</p>
<p>The contractor is to prepare educational materials that are suitable to their primary care clinical environment and relevant patient population, i.e., clinicians involved in the care of diabetic patients, and working patients with uncontrolled diabetes. The materials are to convey the knowledge provided in the Diabetes_and_Work_Environment_CDS_Knowledge document and can also include knowledge from other, reliable sources.</p>
<p>The contractor is to translate the structured model into technical requirements that can become part of the instructions to an implementation team to create or modify CDS software. The contractor is to combine the requirements derived from the model with SME input, site-specific workflow, CDS delivery-tool, and EHR system and CDS software requirements to prepare site-specific technical requirements. The contractor is to use the site-specific technical requirements to instruct the modification of CDS software available at the clinical entity to implement the information and logic of the CDS.</p>
<p>The contractor is to evaluate the implementation and use of the CDS as it facilitates care at the interface of work and health. The evaluation is to provide data (qualitative and quantitative) to achieve the objectives stated above. Additional objectives as desired by the clinical entity also may be incorporated.</p>
<p>The contractor shall use recognized best practices to perform the following activities related to the planning and implementation of the CDS in their clinical environment, collection of evaluation data by an unbiased/independent party, and CDS tool adjustments as needed based on evaluation data collected during the project:</p>
<p>&bull; Detailed initiation, planning, and development<br />o Requirements-gathering from NIOSH SMEs, relevant system vendor(s), and internal clinicians<br />o CDS design that incorporates usability principles, best practices, and common standards<br />o Development of the CDS and the reports<br />o Usability and quality assurance testing of the CDS<br />o User acceptance testing of the CDS, both for content acceptance and system use<br />o Preparation of educational materials<br />&bull; Implementation of the CDS<br />o Clinician training in the use of the CDS tool<br />o Clinician training on the content and value of the CDS information<br />o Deployment of the CDS<br />o Monitoring and maintenance; addressing issues with the CDS, if needed<br />o Addressing issues with educational materials, if needed<br />&bull; Evaluation of the CDS<br />o Performance measurement of the CDS<br />&#61607; Qualitative assessment of the CDS based on user and patient interviews<br />&#61607; Quantitative (process) assessment of the CDS based on data acquired through reports generated using available electronic health information system(s)<br />o Health outcome measurement, if possible<br />o Analysis of the performance and health outcome measurement data collected<br />o Lessons learned in development and implementation<br /><br /><br /><strong>*****REF#11.&nbsp; Mardon R, Mercincavage L, Johnson M, Finley S, Pan E, Arora D.

<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT:  Two questions were provided before the deadline 
Friday, Feb 5th.  1. Based on the questions and answers, it is unclear if you are allowing the proposed PM/SS 15 months to complete the FAI Level 1 training.

Does the 15 month training requirement apply for the PM/SS as well?  The FAA expects to have individuals who meet the qualifications employed on this effort.  The PM/SS would have 15 months to get the necessary training provided the person meets the other qualifications.

DHS S&amp;T is interested in bridging the gap from existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products to deployment. <br />This RFI seeks potential COTS products that require additional testing or development in order to be procured by the transportation industry for use.  The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive capability assessment document to provide transit agencies throughout the nation a guide to implementing deployable solutions to protect their infrastructure and avoid flood damage.

<DESC>This amendment is being issued to make two clarifications from the original solicitation.
1) The solicitation stated the applicable labor category as "shuttle bus driver". This information was provided for informational purposes only. The contractors are solely responsible for choosing the correct labor category. Any issues related to the proper wages paid under this contract will be a matter for the Department of Labor.
2) There was a typographical error in the description of the FedBizOpps notice. The period of performance is May 1, 2016 to April 30, 2021, which consists of a base year plus four option years. The correct dates were used in the Performance Work Statement of the solicitation document.

<DESC>The objective of this effort is to ensure the continued support of the TCNO, in support of the Threat Systems Management Office (TSMO) and the Army Threat Simulator (ATS) Program. This continuation of support of the TCNO mission under TSMO, will enable the continued provision of a Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) cyber capability that replicates full-spectrum information operations against Systems Under Test (SUT) as directed by the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), and other targets as directed by the Army under Executive Order (EXORD) 032-14.
<p>The purpose of this justification is to approve a modification to a cost plus fixed fee Contract W900KK-13-C-0044 for Threat Computer Network Operations (TCNO) support. This contract action will extend the Period of Performance (PoP) and increase the maximum contract amount in support of the Threat Systems Management Office (TSMO) from the current ceiling of $10,000,000 to $14,000,000. The contract is, and will be funded with Program Objective Memorandum (POM) allocated Research Development Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and customer funds which may include OPA, OMA, or other resources.</p>
