Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

ANSWER:  Base period has been changed to nine months and the quantities corrected to nine month period.  Option periods are for 12 months. See revised bid schedule. 2) Page 3 Item No 0001 Laundry Services             Quantity    Unit        Unit Price            Amount              (Blank)    (Blank)                                                         ______________                                 Net Amt What are you looking for in the space left for Net Amt? What are we supposed to price out, if anything? ANSWER:  CLINs 0001, 1001, 2001, 3001, and 4001 are for information only.  No pricing is required. 3) Page 18        52.211-16 Variation in Quantity (1984) Please explain (a) & (b). Government standard practices in prior years for estimated quantities allowed a variance of 19% before a contractor could approach the Government for additional monies due to a large drop in the estimated quantities. Does the above clause represent this me thodology of Government standard practices ANSWER:  Clause has been removed. 4) Page 48     Instructions for Preparation and Submission of Offers (Proposals)  Written Documentation.     Written offers (proposals)shall be prepared in separate volumes and submitted as follows:  Part I - Administrative (Four copies) Part II - Technical Proposal (Four copies) Part III - Past Performance Experience (One copy) Part IV - Pricing (Two copies) Is there one volume  which includes the corresponding copies of the above items? Or are you requesting 11 separate documents? ANSWER: Submit eleven separate documents. 5)Page 39-40     52.237-3     Continuity of Services (Jan 1999)     a), b), c), & d) Summary: The Contractor recognizes services must be continued without interruption and that a successor....another contract may continue them. The Contractor agrees to furnish phase in training and exercise its best efforts for an orderly transition. Does this clause exist in the current contractor's contract. If so, will contracting give assurances that the above will occur? ANSWER:  Yes.  Yes. 6) Is there an occupation code  - title that covers the employee manning the pickup and delivery station? Does the person have to man the point all day? Mr  Vela stated that the employee might not have to be at the point the entire time. How is it currentl y run? ANSWER: A Counter Attendant is expected to be available between the hours of 0715  1600, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. 7) page 73     Category C Items: Tableskirts: process calls for FWI I believe this is an oversight. Tableskirts get damaged in the ironer. Tableskirts are probably folded after they are washed. The legend code for that would be F - Fold. Please clarify. ANSWER: The tableskirts laundry process will be W, P, F, T. 8) page 73     Category C Items: Drapes or Curtains (X Sq Yd) Does the quantity listed (56) signify the number of curtains or the square yards? ANSWER: The number of curtains. 9) page 73     Category C Items: Pillow, Feathers Under the Texas bedding law, washing feather/down-filled pillows is against the law. Lackland Lodging at Lackland AFB, went  to a throw away pillow a nd eliminated sending feather pillows to laundries. The state law does allow the reuse of feathers, if cleaned through a special process, but the ticking could not be reused or washed. You would have to replace the ticking. Could it be that the current contractor is washing the pillow? The current process requirements in the legend ask for pillows to be washed and dried. Please look into this matter as we do not intend to break any State laws regarding feather bedding. ANSWER: The pillows are a synthetic fiber fill pillow which can be washed in a conventional washer. 10) All category items identified with T-tie with string. Can you specify how many pieces are tied together by item (ie 10 sheets per tied bundle etc)? ANSWER:  No. 11) There are some items, (ie straps, suspenders, parka, etc) that we would like to see first hand. The government has drastically changed  items.

If so, are these items marked as hazard linen(ie, yellow bagg ed with red markings)? ANSWER: No.  These items are used as training aids. 14) We have heard that the manufacturers care label of some Category B items specify no machine w ashing and no machine drying. You have to hand wash, scrub off soil and the air-dry. Can you please identify if any of the Category B items fall under this type of recommended care? If so, would you add hand wash and air dry to the legend on page 73 to ref lect the manufacturers care label requirements? ANSWER:  Laundry Category B items as specified. 15) There are no washcloths or bath mats listed in Category A. Is this an oversight?

ANSWER:  All are trousers requiring same laundry process. 19) Are the quantities on the solicitation 12 month quantities? ANSWER: The base period quantities are for nine months. The option periods are for 12 months. 20) The User at the warehouse indicated the Alice pack and the field pack are one in the same. In order to avoid any confusion, would it be better to list the item as the Alice pack and combine the quantities.? The user refers to it as the Alice Pack.The c are label inside the Alice pack calls for hand washing and air drying. It says do not launder and do not dry clean.  ANSWER: Launder Category B items as listed in Technical Exhibit 2. 21) Reference was made to black sleeping bags and green sleeping  bags. Although the black sleeping bags look like sleeping bags, they are more commonly referred to as Intermediate - Cold - Black. The outside is made of an insulation type material.
