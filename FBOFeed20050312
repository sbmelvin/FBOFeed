<DESC>This announcement will serve as notice that the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Office of Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC), NA-114, is seeking small business prime contractor sources for a potential acquisition.  NNSA is currently requesting Statements of Capabilities from qualified sources and no proposals are being solicited at this time. Teaming arrangements with a small business capable of performing 51% of the effort shall also qualify for this sources sought synopsis. The objective of this acquisition is to perform an analysis of siting options for the program‚Äôs high-performance computing (HPC) capability platforms, which includes the following:  analyzing technical strengths and operating costs for current operating configurations at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and Sandia National Laboratory (SNL); developing alternative siting solutions to support NNSA and the nuclear weapons complex (NWC) laboratories; and, conducting a comparative study of current and alternative siting options to provide the cost and benefit tradeoffs among feasible scenarios.  Solutions/Options must account for: operations being classified at DOE ‚ÄúQ‚Äù level; 24/7/365 access by all three NWC laboratories; uninterrupted service breaks between generations of production platforms; reliable power distribution and costs; uninterrupted power supply (UPS) not required on compute nodes; UPS required on service and IO nodes for graceful shutdown; storage hierarchy supported by a high-speed network; user and system support services which are expert in HPC environments; access to a reliable, very-high-speed, secure, long-haul network that will enable long-distance, high-end computing-at-a-distance; siting at LANL, LLNL, SNL or third party location; government determination of hardware architectural features; physical and data security of ‚Äúnational asset‚Äù, considering intentional attacks, unintended interruptions, and natural disaster; facility operating and maintenance costs;  personnel costs; user focus including reliability, availability, and serviceability of the overall site; seamless, or nearly seamless, integration with capacity computing environments from the perspective of the applications being run; and other factors that are determined to be germane. The NAICS code is 541512, size standard of $21.0 Million as defined in FAR 19.101. The Draft Statement of Work (DSOW) is posted as Attachment 1. Interested concerns must be able to demonstrate their experience in planning for large data center operations as well as experience with scientific supercomputing operations.  Offeror personnel must have, or be capable of obtaining, a DOE ‚ÄúQ‚Äù Clearance.  Work is expected to be conducted primarily at contractor‚Äôs facilities, but some work will be conducted at laboratory sites. This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and regulations. A statement of capability should be submitted no later than close of business 28 Mar 05 by those interested firms to the Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) located at http://e-center.doe.gov.    All statements of capability must include company name, mailing address, and company size. Information submitted in the statements of capability should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications: (1) Experience: An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed, and any in-house research and development efforts; and, (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientists, engineers and technical personnel who may be assigned as principal investigator and/or project officer.  The statements of capability will be limited to 15 pages in addition to resumes and pertinent samples of documentation (i.e. design, characterization, field testing and lab facility reports), the latter not to exceed 10 pages.
