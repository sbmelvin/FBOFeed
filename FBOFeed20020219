<DESC>NASA/GRC plans to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) for  Performance Based Task Order Description:   The Contractor's work shall involve software code development of the CARES/MEMS (Ceramics Analysis and Reliability Evaluation of Structures for Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) program.  This effort is an outgrowth from the CARES/Life program for reliability analysis of bulk monolithic ceramic structures.   CARES/MEMS will be a dedicated version of CARES/Life tailored to the unique challenges of MEMS devices.  The Contractors shall prepare and release updates (as needed) of the CARES/MEMS program to American industry, publish the results of related advancements in research publications and give oral presentations to appropriate NASA staff and technical communities.  The contractor will also assist in experimental verification activities regarding MEMS reliability modeling methodologies in cooperation with NASA GRC Life Prediction Branch (Org. 5920) and the Sensors and Electronics Technology Branch (Org. 5510).  This work seeks to examine the stochastic strength behavior of brittle MEMS materials at appropriate size scales, and to test the viability of using the Weibull distribution to model such devices. The information obtained could be used to help assess the integrity and durability of sensors and micro-engines/rockets.   This effort will also help establish greater understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the stochastic strength behavior in MEMS devices, and to test the viability of using the GRC program CARES/MEMS under development.  Expertise and prior history shall be provided by the bidder in the disciplines required to successfully complete the CARES/MEMS project.  Proof of level of expertise and experience is requested from the bidder by providing NASA a list of technical publications/reports and contracts of work performed in these areas (item 1 to 5 below).  The bidder shall have knowledge and experience in: 1. Batdorf statistics for multiaxial loading of brittle isotropic materials.  The bidder shall have knowledge of Batdorf methodology and how it extends to proof testing, grinding damage, and anisotropic materials.  Further and foremost, the bidder shall be familiar with this methodology as applied to transient loading situations as a function of time/temperature where Batdorf, Weibull, and fatigue parameters can vary with time/temperature.  The bidder also shall be familiar with how slow crack growth and fatigue are incorporated into the Batdorf methodology.  The bidder shall be familiar with the normalized Batdorf Crack Density Coefficient, how its computed, and how it's applied to component reliability analysis.  The bidder also shall be knowledgeable in Weibull, Batdorf and fatigue parameter estimation techniques from specimen rupture data from generalized component geometries. 2. The bidder shall be intimately familiar with the NASA CARES/Life computer program.  Both in the use of the program and in its programming. The bidder shall be familiar with the CARES/Life numerical algorithms both for component time-dependent reliability prediction as well as parameter estimation (Weibull, Batdorf, and fatigue parameters).    3. The bidder shall be intimately familiar with the FORTRAN and Delphi computer languages. 4. The bidder shall have expertise with the ANSYS and ABAQUS finite element programs such that they can write and debug custom written macros written in the base languages (example for ANSYS is APDL - ANSYS Parametric Design Language) of these software packages. 5. The bidder shall be familiar with  structural MEMS (MicroElectroMechanical Systems) issues - such as testing methods and data analysis techniques.   THE CONTRACTORS SHALL PERFORM DUTIES AS INDICATED BELOW: 1. Complete the development of FORTRAN based coding that will function as an input/output (I/O) interface to existing (partially developed) transient reliability analysis subroutines and existing (within WinCARES version 5.2) Weibulland Fatigue parameter estimation subroutines (developed at GRC).  The transient reliability coding must span both Batdorf and PIA (Principal of Independent Action) based analysis.  This code must be capable of reading a specified format (neutral data base) of transient finite element analysis results and outputting component reliability at user specified time steps.  The new capabilities of single crystal transient reliability analysis and transient proof testing is also to be included.  The time-dependent transient reliability analysis capability must include formulations for power law, Paris law, Walker law, and a superposed (combined) power and Walker law life prediction capability. The contractor is responsible for modifying and extending the GRC supplied numerical algorithms with the new capabilities outlined in this statement of work.  Output features must include element risk-of-rupture data files formatted for ANSYS, PATRAN, and IDEAS import.  Additional I/O features should include user-selected outputs of element stresses, properties, and reliability as a function of time steps.  Capability to perform reliability analysis on multiple concurrent flaw populations simultaneously is required for both volume flaw and surface flaw based criteria.  Additional I/O functionality is required to account for cyclic symmetry (component geometry multiplication) reliability analysis and multiplication of element stresses by a user defined factor.  The parameter estimation and component reliability analysis capability need to work seamlessly (must be interoperable) such that results from parameter estimation are made directly available to the component reliability analysis module.  A text based input format controlling the CARES/MEMS program must also be developed.  This input structure will consist of mutually agreed upon (Between Contractor and NASA) keywords in a free-field input format style that controls the overall function of CARES/MEMS.  The delivered FORTRAN code must be of a quality level such that it can be released to US based organizations for beta testing.  The code needs to be in a modular format so new capabilities are easily added - such as I/O for single crystal reliability analysis.  Documentation regarding keywords, input arguments, program setup, and program operation must also be included in the form of a user's manual. 2. Develop in cooperation with NASA, FORTRAN coding for a single crystal reliability model for cubic crystal systems consistent with single crystal silicon and single crystal silicon carbide.  This capability must include time-dependent transient reliability analysis with proof testing.  The anisotropic reliability modeling methodology will be specified by NASA.  This item must operate with item (1) above and item (4) below and have a simplified input structure for easy selection by a user. 3. Develop in cooperation with NASA, FORTRAN coding for edge flaw reliability analysis of a component.  This methodology will be a simplified PIA formulation of a single stress component.  The reliability modeling methodology will be specified/provided by NASA.  Again, this includes the capability for time-dependent transient reliability analysis.  Also, develop FORTRAN coding to determine the Weibull scale parameter of edge flaw data from tensile and 3- and 4-point flexure specimen rupture data.  The parameter estimation methodology will be specified by NASA.  This item must operate with item (1) above and item (4) below and have a simplified input structure for easy selection by a user. 4. Complete the development of the Windows based GUI for item (1) above incorporating transient analysis and parameter estimation capabilities.  The GUI will be an enhancement/replacement of the existing CARES GUI.  This GUI will include an interface to the Weibull and fatigue based parameter estimation, the PEST module of CARES/Life (WinCARES version 5.2).  It will also be capable of  working with ANSYS ABAQUS, and MARC files/databases to create CARES/MEMS compatible neutral data files of finite element analysis results.  NASA will supply FORTRAN based algorithms that create the CARES/MEMS compatible neutral file database from ANSYS, ABAQUS, and MARC, files/databases.  The contractor will be responsible for modifying these FORTRAN codes into a finalized neutral data file format and making them interoperate with the CARES/MEMS GUI.  The GUI will be based on the Delphi language (and software) from the vendor Borland.  The GUI will allow the user control over individual input items to the CARES/MEMS FORTRAN code for both component life prediction and parameter estimation.  The GUI will prepare text based input files in the format prescribed for item (1) above.  The GUI will also display results from analysis. 5. Prepare simplified users manual of CARES/MEMS including example/benchmark problems demonstrating CARES/MEMS capabilities.  These can be simple or complex component geometries at the discretion of the contractor.  This must include a demonstration of edge flaw and single crystal reliability analysis capability.  The ANSYS edge flaw recognition macro developed previously for NASA must be demonstrated to work in the prepared example problem. All example/benchmark problems must be sufficiently documented such that a 3rd party user can understand, duplicate, and apply these capabilities to other MEMS components. 6. Complete a test matrix for the design of experiments of square and round pressure membranes of various materials. This requires detailed finite element modeling of the membrane and support structure in order to properly model areas of high stress.  CARES/Life will be used to calculate effective areas of the films to examine a hypothetical Weibull size effect between the different geometries for Weibull modulii of 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, and 25.0.  Hypothetical 90% confidence intervals on the Weibull characteristic strength will be determined for the various Weibull modulii and specimen geometries.  This analysis will enable the fabrication of test specimens (by NASA) appropriate to test the Weibull size effect hypothesis.  The analysis will also be used to help determine what pressure levels are required to cause rupture in a pressure rig. 7. Cooperate with Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in the reliability analysis investigation of straight, notched, and holed, microtensile beams for evidence of Weibull size effect.  The contractor shall be responsible for designing a microtensile specimen geometry of a geometry that yields an intermediate effective area (intermediate Weibull size effect) between a notched and straight-sided specimen geometry.  The design must be compatible with the existing JHU microtensile specimen testing rig.  The contractor shall subsequently perform reliability analysis in conjunction with finite element analysis using results of fracture stresses of the various specimen geometries (fracture stress data provided by JHU).  The contractor will participate in co-authoring a technical paper with NASA and Johns Hopkins researchers regarding this work (item 7). 8. Participate in co-authoring a technical paper with NASA personnel regarding newly developed transient reliability analysis capability.  This work assignment requires expertise in FORTRAN and Delphi programming languages as well as expertise with finite element analysis software and use (and programming) of the CARES/Life program.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA, intends to issue a contract to Science and Applied Technology, Inc. (SAT, Inc.) on an other than full and open competition basis.  The contract will support the High Speed Anti-Radiation Demonstration (HSAD) Project.  The government's requirement is for the development, demonstration and delivery of a HSAD vehicle forebody section that will support demonstration of a new integral nozzleless rocket, variable flow ducted rocket ramjet propulsion and steering control subsystem.  The forebody will use existing Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM) hardware and software.  SAT, Inc. is the sole contractor of the AARGM Phase I, II & III Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program contracts.  As such, they have exclusive design rights to the products of that development.  To meet HSAD objectives, the HSAD Program Airframe/Propulsion/Steering (APS) section will be integrated with components of the AARGM to form a forebody section.  The proposed forebody section will be composed of components of the AARGM active mode seeker or anti-radiation homing (ARH) antenna array, a modified autopilot, modified power supply components, an instrumentation package, and appropriate ballast.  The forebody section must have the following key characteristics:  (1) must be capable of surviving captive carry and launch from an F/A-18 C/D aircraft; (2) must be compatible with the HSAD Airframe Propulsion Steering Control (APS) subsystem; (3) must be compatible with current HARM/AARGM F/A-18 C/D interfaces; (4) Must have appropriate mass properties to ensure overall Vehicle mass balance; (5) must interface and integrate with a government furnished HARM/AARGM Telemetry/Flight Termination section; (6) must use AARGM hardware and software components to provide Vehicle power/power conditioning, stability and control commands, and aerodynamic shape.  The integral rocket/ramjet propulsion and steering control subsystem is intended to enhance the capabilities of an evolving Anti-Radiation Missile (ARM) weapon system.  The HSAD Project is directed toward increasing the range and average velocity of an advanced version of the High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) system.  This advanced ARM is tentatively to be called the Higher Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HSARM).  The forebody development will be in cooperation with the APS contractor and NAWCWD.  Based on the results of industry and government APS conceptual studies and the Defense Suppression Program Office (PMA-242) ARM roadmap, the government has narrowed the APS concept to be an integral rocket, variable flow ducted rocket ramjet and a tail controlled steering concept.  Specifically a ten (10) inch diameter nominal propulsion/airframe is viewed as the lowest risk approach for meeting system requirements while leveraging existing compatible guidance/autopilot and telemetry/flight terminal systems.  The HSAD Project began in Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2002 and will span four years.  The captive and free flight demonstration of the vehicle is anticipated in the mid GFY 2005 timeframe.  The successful free flight demonstration of the HSAD vehicle is planned to form the baseline for follow-on System Development and Demonstration (SD&D) Program.  In such a SD&D program, an advanced ARM guidance/control subsystem and a HSAD APS subsystem would be integrated into a HSARM system for ultimate release to Limited Rate Production and follow on full-rate production.  The HSAD project is administrated by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) Time Critical Strike (TSC) element.  Access to classified information up to the secret level is anticipated in the performance of this contract.  The contractor shall be required to have and maintain the proper facility clearances.  Potential sources are required to provide the contract office with its level of clearance, current mailing address, point of contact and telephone number.  Send to the attention of Linda Long, Contract Specialist, at email: longll@navair.navy.mil.  The government contemplates award of a Cost Plus Fixed Fee Research and Development Completion Form type of contract for this effort.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 6 March 2002 and will be available through the Contracts Competency homepage Web site at: https://contracts.nawcwd.navy.mil/rfp-nawc.htm.  All responsible sources may identify their interest and capability to perform the requirement or submit a proposal.  Responses/proposals must be received within 45 days from date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination not to compete the requirement, based on responses received, is solely within the discretion of the Government    See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  Advances in bioengineering, analytical chemistry, molecular biology and electronics have resulted in a host of very sensitive and ever-shrinking sensors for whole cells, proteins, nucleic acids, inorganic and organic chemicals in a variety of sample types. Such microanalytical "lab-on-a-chip" and mass spectral analysis devices promise to revolutionize health care, medicine, disease diagnostics, food and agriculture, bioprocess monitoring, forensics, and water quality analysis.   A problem is that the quest for miniaturized "sensors" and the use of very small sample volumes has all but ignored critical aspects of sample acquisition and preparation, where microorganisms, genes, proteins of interest, or other chemical species (pesticides, herbicides, organic molecules, etc.) represent only a very small portion of the sample volume, exist well below the detection limits of microanalytical sensors and reside in a sample type not immediately conducive to nanofluidic processes. Idealized detection systems require an integrated sample preparation capability that provides collection, lysis (for biological samples), purification and concentration functions for delivery of analytes to these advanced small volume detectors, with the ability to process diverse sample matrices, solution chemistries and target concentrations in a spectrum of genetic and chemical backgrounds.   The Battelle-PNNL Enhanced Analyte Delivery System (BEADS) represents the enabling technology for deployment of microanalytical sensors at the point-of-use, whether in a doctor's office, at a patient's bedside, on the food processing line, in the battlefield, or on-line at a wastewater treatment facility. This straightforward solution for bio-chemical/chemical sample preparation envelopes all microbead-based selective chemistries with renewable microcolumns, closing the sample (hundreds of milliliters) to detector (microliter to picoliter) volume gap typical of most chip-based detection systems. Implementation of BEADS sample preparation technology with many biological or chemical detectors results in a simple, precise, reproducible, rugged, portable, fully automated and truly integrated fluidic system for a myriad of clinical, biomedical, environmental, and industrial applications.   Advantages:  (i) Straightforward solutions to handling large (100s of ml.) to small (micro liter) sample volumes.  (ii) Almost all existing bead chemistries (protein, nucleic acid, chemicals) can be used.  (iii) Can handle difficult and raw sample types and deliver proteins, nucleic acids, cells, etc.  (iv) Adaptable to multiple detector types and configurations.  (v) Can easily be made small, rugged, portable and is closed to the environment.   Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The work under this procurement consists of the contractor providing all labor, material, equipment, transportation, and supervision to repair and replace various types of roofing systems, including but not limited to, built-up, roll, metal, asphalt shingle, clay tile, and modified bitumen for Navy and Marine Corps activities in the greater San Diego, California area (including Camp Pendleton, California) and the Southern California high desert area including, but not limited to, 29 Palms and Barstow.  Work may include all tasks required for a complete roofing repair or replacement including incidental related work.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 235610.  This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis.  The Government anticipates awarding one or more Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  One solicitation will be issued that contains contract line items numbers (CLINs) for the greater San Diego area, including Camp Pendleton, and CLINs for the Southern California high desert area, including 29 Palms, Barstow, and surrounding Navy and Marine Corps activities.  The Government may award all CLINs to one firm, but reserves the right to split the award and issue separate contracts for each geographic area.  Firms responding to this announcement must show a range of roofing experience consistent with this description and the following evaluation factors.  Evaluation factors:  (1) past performance information, (1A) safety and health performance, (2) technical experience,  (2A) specialized experience in handling hazardous materials specifically lead based paint and asbestos, and (3) price.  When the proposal is evaluated, Factors 1 and 2 are equal in importance.  Within Factor 1, Subfactor 1A is considered highly important relative to consideration that an offeror is technically acceptable in Factor 1.  Within Factor 2, Subfactor 2A is considered highly important relative to consideration that an offeror is technically acceptable in Factor 2.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1 and 2 combined are approximately equal in importance to Factor 3.   The source selection process will identify whether offerors are technically acceptable and which technically acceptable offer provides the lowest price to the Government for each geographic region.  An offeror?s proposal will be evaluated relative to past performance information, including safety and health performance, and experience, including specialized experience, to determine if the offeror is technically acceptable.  Offerors meeting the technical requirements will be evaluated relative to price for each geographic area.  Award(s) will be made to the responsive, responsible offeror(s) who offer the lowest price, technically acceptable proposal for each geographic region. Proposal will not be given greater consideration for exceeding stated technical requirements.  Price will be the determining factor for award to a technically acceptable offeror.  The award will consist of a base year and one option year for each geographic region.  The minimum guarantee per contract is $5,000.00.  Work will be ordered on individual Task Orders placed against the contract.  Individual task orders will range from $2,000.00 to $250,000.00.  The total value of the contract is estimated to be more than $10,000,000.00 for all line items base period and option period combined.  The availability of this solicitation will be limited to electronic media; the solicitation will be available for viewing and downloading, free of charge, via the electronic solicitation website:  http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.

<DESC>Request for Proposals (RFP) N01-CN-25000-39, entitled:  Phase 1 and Phase 2 Clinical Trials of Cancer Chemopreventive Agents

The Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking proposals from qualified organizations who have the ability to conduct early phase clinical trials  and who have the ability to accrue a specified number of subjects per year. The main objectives of the contracts that will be awarded as a result of this solicitation will be the conduct of multiple early phase clinical trials of NCI/DCP-sponsored cancer preventive agents and the establishment of infrastructures composed of one or more collaborating institutions that will perform these trials.  These contracts will replace the current Phase 1 and Phase 2 Clinical Trials of Cancer Chemopreventive Agents Master Agreement pools. The trials conducted under the new contracts will assess the cancer preventive potential of various agents by evaluating the biologic effects of these agents on their molecular targets and by determining clinically relevant correlates.  Major emphasis will be on phase 2 preliminary efficacy studies, although phase 1 pharmacokinetic and safety studies as well as pilot studies exploring combinations of agents,  for which individual toxicities are known, will also be supported.  The agents to be studied shall include agents developed by the pharmaceutical industry and provided to the NCI for collaborative development as well as commercially available agents and agents developed by the NCI.  NCI/DCP requires a total contract pool that will provide 500 to 1000 study participants accrued to phase 2 and phase 1 (if applicable) trials per year.  NCI/DCP intends to make multiple contract awards under this program. The contract will consist of a base period of three years plus two option periods of one year each.  The Contractor shall initiate 1 to 5 clinical trials each year, with the intent of accruing 75-150 subjects (a minimum of 75 subjects required, but with option to accrue greater numbers) into NCI/DCP-sponsored trials each year. Within each base year/period (years 1 -3) of the contract as well as within option year/period 1 and option year/period 2, the Government shall have the option to fund an additional 25 or 50 study participants (over and above the 75 patient minimum).  Investigators are encouraged to work together and to seek collaborations within and outside their institutions in order to enhance their proposal.  Since an individual institution may be awarded only one contract, investigators at institutions capable of performing studies in multiple organ sites are encouraged to work together to present a single proposal.  Capacity to perform studies in multiple organs (i.e., more than 2) will be considered a valuable asset.  The North American Industry Classification System (NIACS) code is 541710. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued ELECTRONICALLY approximately March 5, 2002.  The RFP will be available on the Research Contracts Branch (RCB) website at : http://rcb.nci.nih.gov     Click on:  Current Requests for Proposals.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above internet site for the release of this solicitation and amendments, if any.  POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.  Point of contact: Theresa H. Shroff, Contracting Officer, Prevention, Control and Population Sciences Section (PCPSS), Research Contracts Branch (RCB), NCI, 6116 Executive Boulevard, Room 205, MSC 8337, Rockville, Maryland 20852-8337. Phone: (301) 435-3796; fax: (301) 402-8579.  ALL QUESTIONS/INQUIRIES SHALL BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY TO THERESA H. SHROFF, CONTRACTING OFFICER, AT  TS144T@NIH.GOV   All requests for information should reference RFP No. N01-CN-25000-39.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>The Bureau of the Census intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order, utilizing simplified acquisition procedures (under FAR 13.5) to the National Institute of Statistical Sciences, PO Box 14006, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 for the development of computational methods for obtaining seasonal adjustments of monthly economic time series with seasonal variation, trading day effects, holiday effects and potentially also outlier effects with the use of unobserved component time series models having non-Gaussian exponential family distributions for some components. The main goal is to determine whether such non-Gaussian models deal with outlier effects in a more effective and sable way than Gaussian models with outlier regressors determined by t-statistics exceeding a fixed critical value, a method in current use at the Bureau of the Census. Because estimation of unobserved components of seasonal state space models involves the calculation of conditional expectations from multivariate distributions of dimension fourteen or higher, in the non-Gaussian case, high dimensional integrals must be approximated using advanced Bayesian statistical methods, e.g. using importance sampling and antithetic variables; therefore knowledge of and experience with similar methods and with Kalman filtering and smoothing methods is a requirement for the position. Period of performance is one year from date of award.  The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only and is not a request for bids; no solicitation will be issued.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This action is being taken to revise the requirements regarding Government validation of contractor laboratory testing facilities, for cl arification.  If you previously submitted under Solicitation No. DACW17-02-R-0006, you will be considered and you need not resubmit.  However, if you wish to revise your submittal, it must be received by the closing date and time specified herein.  If you no longer wish to be considered, please notify this office in writing.  Revisions are located in Factor for Evaluation No. 2, EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE TO THE FIRM.   Up to five contracts may be awarded from this solicitation.  Up to three of these contracts may be awarded using unrestricted acquisition procedures and up to two contracts may be awarded pursuant to small business set-aside procedures.  Each contract will  be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity contract for a period of one year from date of award, with options to extend for two additional years; not to exceed a total of three years.  The Government reserves the right to exercise the contract options be fore the expiration of the base contract period or preceding option period, if the contract amount for the base period or preceding option period has been exhausted or nearly exhausted.  Work will be assigned by negotiated task orders.  Maximum order limit s are $1,000,000 for each contract year and $1,000,000 per task order.  The primary purpose of these proposed contracts is to provide services for projects located within the Florida boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  Secondarily, the contract may b e used to provide services within the geographic boundaries of any other U.S. Army Corps of Engineers District within the South Atlantic Division.  The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services to be performed outside the geographic boun daries of the Jacksonville District.  Criteria used in allocating task orders among the contracts include performance and quality of deliverables under current task orders, current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time, specialized experien ce, equitable distribution of the work among the contractors, and other relevant factors.  PROJECT INFORMATION: Services will include geotechnical subsurface sampling via continuous and/or standard SPT techniques, coring within rock units, field testing, l aboratory analysis of recovered materials, site preparation, and establishing coordinate locations.  The geographic extent of the assignments is within the State of Florida.  A summary geotechnical report including an expert opinion and geotechnical recomm endations will be required as part of each assignment.  Factors for Evaluation in order of priority are: 1. SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE: Firm must clearly demonstrate specialized experience and expertise in the following field data coll ection procedures: core boring (split spoon and rock coring), wash probing, vibracoring, undisturbed sampling, test pits, recharge tests, percolation tests, pump tests, piezometer installations, etc.  Field conditions may include upland, swamp, and on wate r (both fresh water and marine water environments).  Firm must clearly demonstrate specialized experience and expertise in the following laboratory analyses: grain size distribution, carbonate content, atterberg limits, moisture content, specific gravity, sedimentation rate, loss on ignition, compaction tests (4 inch and 6 inch molds), etc. Firm must also demonstrate experience related to site clearing, heavy equipment operation, establishing coordinate locations on land and in water, obtaining rights of en try, etc.   2.  EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE TO THE FIRM: Firm must have all necessary drilling equipment, including but not limited to: drill rigs, floating plant for protected waters, site preparation equipment, survey equipment and laboratory testing fa cilities.  Firm must indicate equipment's physical location and whether the equipment is owned or leased. Firm will also be required to submit documentation confirming that it has obtained or is in the process of obtaining Government validation of its labo ratory testing facilities at time of contract award.  No task orders will be issued until Government validation of laboratory testing facilities has been successfully completed. 3. SIZE AND EXPERTISE OF STAFF: Firm must have, either in-house or through ass ociation with qualified subcontractors, adequate staff with specialized experience, including but not limited to registered geologists, registered civil (soils) engineers, registered surveyors, soil technicians, data entry technicians, drillers, equipment operators, etc.  A geologist or civil (soils) engineer, knowledgeable in the geology of Florida, must observe all drilling operations and prepare detailed field logs to document sampling procedures.  A registered surveyor must validate all coordinate locat ions and elevations.  4. PAST PERFORMANCE: Firm must demonstrate its past performance in the accomplishment of similar work.  Firm must list current contracts and related information including the name, address, and telephone number of references.  Pertine nt issues are ability to meet established schedules, ability to accomplish work within budgetary limitations, and quality of the delivered product.  Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry regarding quality and timelines s of work will be reviewed.  Past DOD experience data available to the Government through the A-E Contract Administration System (ACASS) and information available from other sources, will be utilized for prior performance evaluation.  THE FOLLOWING SECONDA RY CRITERIA WILL BE USED AS TIEBREAKERS: 5.  GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF FIRM RELATIVE TO THE WORKSITE: Firms based in or having branch offices in Florida with lower mobilization and demobilization costs will be given preference provided there is an adequate nu mber of qualified firms for consideration.  6. VOLUME OF PAST DOD CONTRACTS AWARDED TO FIRM: Work previously awarded to the firm by DOD will be reviewed with the objective of effecting equitable distribution of contracts among equally qualified firms.  SUB MISSION REQUIREMENTS: Firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement and wishing to be considered, must submit one copy each of SF 254 and SF 255 for the firm or joint venture and SF 254 for each subcontractor.  In Block 4 of SF 255 list onl y the office personnel for the office to perform the work which is indicated in Block 3B.  Additional personnel strengths, including consultants and subcontractors should be indicated parenthetically, and their source clearly identified.  In Block 7G of th e SF 255, indicate specific project experience for key team members and indicate the team member's role on each listed project (architect, project manager, etc.).  Submittal of supplemental attachments to SF 255 addressing evaluation factors 1-4 is strongl y recommended.  Submittal package must be received in this office at the address indicated below, no later than 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time on 13 March 2002.  Submittals received after this date and time will not be considered.  Unnecessarily elaborate brochure s or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a complete and effective response to this announcement are not desired.  The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the CCR before  receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense.  The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered.  (The CCR's web site may be accessed at http://www.acq.osd.mil/ec.)  Small and small  disadvantaged business firms are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses.  All interested fi rms are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and small disadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507.  If a large business firm is selected for th is contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  Of those dollars the large business firm intends to subcontract out, the Corps of Engineers floors for subcontracting are 61.4% to small business concerns; 9.1% to SBA Certified Small Disadvantaged Business concerns; 5.0% to women-owned small business concerns; 2.5% for SBA Certified HUBZone concerns and 3.0% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Bus iness.  The term floors is used instead of goals as the Corps of Engineers objective is to exceed the percentages rather than merely meet the percentages.  Large firms should keep these floors in mind when considering qualifications of potential subcon tractors and ensure that each proposed subcontractor's socio-economic status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications.  An approved small business-subcontracting plan will be required prior to award.  The NAIC code is 541330. The size stan dard is $4,000,000.  Your attention is directed to FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, which will be included in the contract set-aside for small business and which states in part: At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred  for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.  Response to this announcement should be in writing only; telephone calls and personal visits are discouraged.  The required forms shall be submitted to the following address: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: CESAJ-EN-T, 400 West Bay Street, Room 565, Jacksonville, FL 32202-4412 or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: CESAJ-EN-T, P.O. Box 4970, Jacksonville, FL 32232-0019.  This is not a request for proposal.  Firms may post their name/addres s on the web site to facilitate contact between prime contractors, sub-contractors, and firms interested in joint ventures.  However, copies of the listings of firms will not be provided.  See our Web Page at www.saj.usace.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>Z -- EPA-NC FACILITIES MAINTENANCE & SUPPORT SERVICES
<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency has a current contract, number 68-D-99-088, and intends to increase the level-of-effort, and increase the materials and subcontracts budgets in each remaining period of the contract, on a sole source basis to Transcontinental Enterprises, Inc. (TEI), pursuant to 41 USC 253(c)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement to provide facilities maintenance and support services for all EPA-owned/leased facilities in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.  The facilities support services include, but are not limited to: 1) alterations, modifications, and repair of buildings, plants, and facilities; 2) planning, estimating, and scheduling of work; 3) carpenter, machine, and metal shop services; 4) preventative maintenance inspections and repairs of facilities and equipment; 5) laboratory fume hood and electrical safety inspections; 6) electronic security system maintenance; 7) fire extinguisher inspections and maintenance; 8) inspection, maintenance, and repair of Government-owned fire alarm systems; 9) construction recycling; and 10) support for facility closeout, restoration and Environmental Due Diligence.

<SUBJECT>99 -- FPI to Offer Filtration Media
<DESC>In furtherance of the Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) Board of Directors' directive that FPI seek to pursue the creation of inmate jobs without mandatory source, a notice was published in the December 21, 1998 edition of the Commerce Business Daily (CBD) regarding FPI's production of products for the Federal government on a competitive (non-mandatory) basis.  The notice stated that FPI's Board of Directors had granted approval for FPI to competitively bid on products for which it did not rely on its status as a mandatory source of supply.  Under this procedure, FPI would not follow the public involvement guidelines process established by 18 U.S.C. 4122(b) which is required for new products FPI offers as a mandatory source.  FPI is required to publish a notice of its intentions to competitively produce a product purchased by the Federal government.

This notice announces FPI's intentions to produce various filtration media on a competitive basis and not use its mandatory source status.  This product encompasses all filters included in the following four Federal Supply Classification (FSC) codes:  FSC code 4140 - Fans, Air Circulators and Blower Equipment; FSC code 4460 - Air Purification Equipment; FSC code 4130 - Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Components; and FSC code 4120 - Air Conditioning Equipment.

FPI was approached pursuant to the corporation's ongoing business development initiative (published as a special notice in the February 11, 2000 edition of the CBD) and entered into a partnership with Filtration Services of Milwaukee, WI, to manufacture this product.  Several small businesses are participating with Filtration Services in furtherance of this initiative.  Inmate labor will be utilized to produce a full-range of heating, ventilating and air conditioning filters.  The partner companies will provide marketing, sales, and distribution to assure the quality of the product.  This initiative will improve prospects for the partner companies to obtain additional business.  This is not an exclusive arrangement for Federal agency contracts.  Other companies for filtration media or other business areas are welcome to participate in such initiatives pursuant to the business development initiative program.

Once a product is sold competitively by FPI, it remains a competitive product and will never be added to FPI's Schedule of Products as a mandatory source product.  FPI will not attempt to exercise its mandatory source at some future point in time for filters, nor will it seek approval from its Board of Directors to expand production of the product by invoking the guidelines process at some later date.

FPI's Board of Directors has determined that whatever share of the market FPI acquires on a competitive basis will be deemed to be a reasonable share of the market within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 4122(b)(2).  Sales of products manufactured under this procedure will be tracked and recorded separately by FPI as is the case for subcontracting and services, since such sales will not be subject to the market share limitations of FPI's expansion guidelines.

Other companies interested in utilizing inmate labor for Federal agency contracts are encouraged to submit a business proposal under FPI's business development initiative.  Business development proposals should be submitted to Federal Prison Industries, Inc.  For further information on FPI's production of filtration media, please contact John Huotari, Contracting Officer, at 202-305-7258.

Interested parties have a right to comment or raise questions at anytime with FPI's Board of Directors.  All written correspondence should be addressed to: Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation, and Corporate Support Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C.  20534.
