<DESC>The Mendocino National Forest requires tree planting and release on approximately 240 acres of National Forest Land.  The sites are dispersed on the forest and are located in Glenn  and Mendocino Counties, California.  The project consists of three items.  Item 1 is auger tree planting on approximately 165 acres with a majority of the work in a previous burn area with grown vegetation that will need to be treated prior to planting.  Item 2 is a hand tree plant by hoedad in a cluster planting configuration on approximately 77 acres.  Item 3 is a manual release of the area planted in Item 2; this treatment requires the severing and removal of all above ground vegetative material (live and dead) within a 5-foot radius of each leave tree.  A prebid tour may be scheduled, please see the solicitation for information on date and time.  Because seedling survival and growth is dependent on proper soil and weather conditions and the conditions will only prevail for a short time it is suggested contractors interested in the project visit the project sites when weather conditions for access are favorable.  For a map to the location please contact the Contracting Officer at (530) 226-2451 and directions and a map will be faxed. 

The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, operating supplies, tools and transportation necessary to perform the work in accordance with the specifications and provisions of the contract.  Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act registration is required.   The planting is dependent on weather conditions and is expected to be performed between late March to mid-May.  Work on the release portion will occur approximately one month after the planting.  

Funds are not presently available for this contract; however, the government anticipates that funding will be available in time to award this contract.  This procurement is solicited under Simplified Acquisition Procedures, total small business set-aside.  Estimated issue date of the solicitation is on or about February 20 with an estimated due date of March 16.  Solicitation documents will be posted on this website.  All responsible sources that submit a timely quote will be considered.

<DESC>The overall mission and goal of the Naval Warrior Applications Division program titled Force Health Protection Future Capability (FHPFC) is to identify those mature and evolving technologies that, through focused investment, guidance and management, can be demonstrated and subsequently made available to the warfighter through a systematic transition to the acquisition process.  The products of the FHPFC investment are to be capabilities that are demonstrated to, and by, the primary customer (fleet operational forces), and, equally as important, capabilities that are ready for transition to the acquisition community.  The FHPFC will not attempt to develop all of the required technologies but will focus on those key areas where the most capability payoff is expected and/or where transition potential is highest.  Many other needed technologies are being pursued by other DoD projects, and the FHPFC will need to leverage and use those technology developments wherever possible.  

The following is a list of the major focus areas of interest to the FHPFC.  ONR is soliciting individual or team efforts to develop innovative technologies in those areas.  It cannot be emphasized too strongly that developments in these areas must work towards an operational demonstration during which the FHPFC products will interact seamlessly with naval systems and information.  

Combat Casualty Care and Management
1.)Capability to non-surgically manage intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal, intra-cranial hemorrhage
2.) Capability to diagnose and treat mild/moderate brain injury (TBI) resulting from repetitive exposure to blast and identification of mechanisms of injury
3.) Capability to more effectively manage wounds to limit infection, accelerate healing and/or tissue regeneration
4.) Capability for scaleable, deployable, medical isolation aboard Navy platforms and improved provision of care onboard high speed vessels
5.) Capability for automated patient monitoring and treatment
6.) Capability to rapidly type, cross-match and detect pathogens in fresh whole blood being collected for transfusion in austere environments (please contact the Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) below for full system requirements)

Casualty Prevention
1.) Capability to provide surveillance, analysis and mitigation of health threats using evidence-based methodologies. Research efforts should focus on flexible modeling tools and surveillance technologies to aid military planners and medical personnel in the control of infectious disease outbreaks
2.) Capability to mitigate the effects of combat stress reaction and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in active duty personnel
3.) Capability for non-pharmacological ?stress inoculation? to prevent combat stress casualties
4.) Capability to preserve and restore hearing

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has a requirement for contracted services supporting the Automated Track Inspection Program (ATIP) involving operation, preventive and remedial maintenance, track data analysis and management, hardware and software track inspection devices, other associated equipment, and supporting services for FRA's fleet of track geometry cars.  The car fleet includes the following:  DOTX 217 is a state-of-the-art rail bound, high-speed, self-propelled geometry car that began regulatory inspection service in February 2001. DOTX 219 and DOTX 220 are new FRA geometry cars expected to be ready for regulatory service early in 2007.  ATIP may also utilize FRA's Research and Development cars (DOTX 216 and DOTX 218) to conduct regulatory inspections and other program requirements.

Since 1974, the national deployment of FRA's ATIP track geometry inspection cars has been an important element in FRA's oversight role in American railroad safety compliance programs. The broad purpose of ATIP is to minimize the risk of a train accident, potentially including a catastrophic hazardous material incident by accurately collecting and disseminating track geometry information and intelligence to FRA and respective railroads. The data collected by the ATIP cars provides supplemental assistance to all railroad Inspectors through advance detection of potential accident-causing hazards by identifying noncompliant and unsafe track geometry locations and conditions needing evaluation and remediation.  FRA also anticipates potential need for ATIP to support requests from other U.S. Government agencies for track inspections.  These may include, but are not necessarily limited to, Department of Energy track inspections prior to nuclear fuel shipping and Department of Defense STRACNET route surveys, and the Department of State.  

The requirement includes contractor services in three areas of responsibility.  These three areas of responsibility have been identified as A, B, and C corresponding to their respective North American Industrial Classification System codes.  In order to optimize competition and exposure to potentially interested vendors for the inter-related areas of responsibility, FRA has synopsized the whole requirement using three distinct solicitation numbers with separate NAICS codes because of the limitation of one NAICS code in www.fedbizopps.gov for each numbered solicitation.  The actual RFP solicitation will be issued for all three areas combined using one number, DTFR53-06-R-00009.  The three areas of responsibility are as follows:   

(A) Operations and maintenance of FRA's geometry car fleet, including all labor, equipment, materials, and transportation necessary to operate and maintain the government-owned geometry cars safely and efficiently, accurately record track geometry data, perform corrective and preventative maintenance work, and make the necessary adjustments required to keep the cars and ATIP geometry equipment and instrumentation functioning properly (NAICS Code 541330); 

(B) Maintain an integrated, centralized, and comprehensive ATIP track data analysis and database management system to manage, store, and provide access for all concerned users (Government and railroads) to all essential information extracted from historical and contemporary ATIP track inspections for the purpose scheduling track maintenance activities and future inspections (NAICS Code 518210); and 

(C) Maintain the hardware and software applications (i.e., Digital Track Notebook, GeoEdit, eBAR, Chordinator) used by track Inspectors to enter information found during manual and ATIP geometry car inspections that can be uploaded into FRA's consolidated safety databases (NAICS Code 54151).  

The estimated overall dollar value for this requirement is in the range of $60-80 million over a period of five years.  There will NOT be an "all or none" restriction for offers in response to the Request for Proposals.  Offerors may propose on one, two, or all three areas of responsibility for this requirement.  It is anticipated that one or more performance-based, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) service contract(s), including cost-plus-fixed-fee and/or fixed price type contracts, may be awarded to address the three areas of responsibility mentioned above.  The anticipated contract(s) will have a base period of one year and four additional one-year option periods.  Individual task orders will be issued under the contract(s) to address specific program requirements, as they are identified and funded.  

The Request for Proposals will be issued through electronic media available for downloading via the Internet at http://fedbizopps.gov.  NO PAPER COPIES OF THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE.  Prospective offerors shall be responsible for monitoring the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and should register themselves to receive automatic electronic notification of amendments thereto (if any), including responses to any questions submitted in accordance with the solicitation provisions.  The Request for Proposals will be an unrestricted solicitation, and all responsible sources may submit an offer.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will utilize written proposals in combination with oral presentations.  

Tentative procurement milestones for this requirement are:  
(1) Issuance of RFP on or about OCT 5, 2006; 
(2) Proposals due on or about NOV 17, 2006; 
(3) Oral presentations during the week of DEC 11-15, 2006; 
(4) Initiation of negotiations on or about JAN 12, 2007; and, 
(5) Contract award on or about JAN 26, 2007.   

These tentative milestones are provided for planning purposes.  While subject to potential slight variations, the time schedule required to meet the contemplated award date mandates that requests for time extensions for written proposals and/or oral presentations may not be honored.

<DESC>The TSA's Security Technology Deployment Office (STDO) is responsible for procuring and deploying technology to support the safety and security of the movement of people and baggage throughout the nation’s airports. STDO is responsible for ensuring that Explosive Trace Detection (ETD) systems and technologies provide airport level security benefits. STDO is planning for the modernization of the current ETD system which will support both legacy and new functional capabilities.

This announcement is being conducted to select qualified technical sources that can compete for a contract to manufacture and deploy state of the art ETD systems.  This contract shall also have options for Training Tasks and Engineering Services on an as-ordered basis by the Government. Projected award of a contract is anticipated by June 2005, with a period of performance from the date of award for a minimum of one (1) year and a maximum of five (5) years inclusive of all options. The Government requires unlimited rights to all data and computer software produced under this contract in accordance with the acquisition method being used.  
In order to make a determination of qualified bidders, the TSA requires the following qualification information from interested sources:

1.  A one-page Notice of Interest delivered to Ms. Patricia Newton by 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) December 23, 2004.  The notice of interest shall identify the Offeror’s proposed ETD equipment for the forthcoming ETD manufacture and deployment RFP.  Offerors shall identify the make, model and country of manufacture for each ETD equipment proposed for TSA consideration. 

2.  Transportation Security Lab (TSL) Certification:  Offeror must submit, at no cost to the Government, a Production Sample Machine(s) to the TSL to be used as the test system for Certification.  During the Certification testing, the Offeror must provide testing support at no cost to the Government.  Offerors, who comply with the Notice of Interest submission requirements, will be notified of the certification testing schedule and Production Sample Machine delivery dates.  Failure to deliver the Production Sample Machine(s) by the delivery date may result in a non-responsive determination by the Contracting Officer and remove the Offeror from further consideration for this procurement.  It is anticipated that Certification testing will be conducted in January 2005.    

3.  Operational Utility Evaluation (OUE):  Offeror must provide, at no cost to the Government, five (5) production machines for an OUE upon successful completion of Certification testing.  Offerors will be notified as to their exact OUE testing schedule.  During the OUE, the offeror must provide testing support at no cost to the Government.  The OUE period of performance is anticipated to last 3 months.  Failure to provide equipment and/or support for OUE may result in a non-responsive determination by the Contracting Officer and remove the Offeror from further consideration for this procurement.

Only qualified sources will be permitted to submit an ETD proposal.  After all testing is completed, a Qualified Vendor’s List (QVL) will be established.  Only those Offerors who appear on the QVL will receive a Request for Proposal (RFP) providing the opportunity to compete for an ETD production, training and engineering services contract. The Government reserves the right to open up the QVL again, at the convenience of the Government.  Interested parties responding to this announcement letter should carefully consider if they have all the expertise required to meet the Government's expected tasking. The purpose of the evaluation is to identify those Offerors that have the expertise, interest, and capabilities to perform these tasks.  Cost information is not requested at this time.

This announcement is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment or a promise of a contract by the Government. This announcement does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses.



3.2.2.3-6 Submittals in the English Language (April 1996)

Submittals in response to this Screening Information Request (SIR) shall be in the English language. Submittals received in other than English shall be rejected.

<SUBJECT>N -- NATO Notification of Intent to Invite Bids for International Competitive Bidding to Provide G/A/G Secure and ECM Resistant UHF Communications for the Czech Republic and Hungary

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the provision of G/A/G Secure and ECM (Electronic Countermeasure) Resistant UHF Communication for the Czech Republic and Hungary. These projects are included respectively in Project Serials 5WI22004 and 5WI17002 under CP5A0035 for the procurement of G/A/G Secure and ECM Resistant UHF Communication.

NC3A is acting as the procurement agent on behalf of the territorial Host Nations for the two projects, which were authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. 

The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference of the Invitation for Bid (IFB) is IFB-CO-12018-GAG. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference.

One IFB will be issued covering both projects, with one resulting contract award. The bidders will be asked to submit a bid for the entire package covering the procurement and implementation in the two Nations. The evaluations will be done for the whole package and therefore a single contractor will be selected for the performance of the resulting contract in the two Nations.

Bidders will be required to declare a bid validity of 12 months from the closing date for receipt of bids, supported by a bid guarantee of Euro 50,000 (USD $64,700). Should the selection and award procedure exceed the 12th month after the bid closing date, firms will be requested to extend the validity of their bids and bid guarantee accordingly. Bidders may decline to do so, withdraw their bid, and excuse themselves from the bidding process without penalty.

The ICB package, including technical specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents, are NATO UNCLASSIFIED. If classified material must be included in the ICB package or in the bidder response to the IFB, the transmission of it will be processed through the U.S. Mission to NATO.

The successful contractor may be required to handle and store classified information up to the level of NATO SECRET. In addition, contractor personnel working on NATO sites will be required to hold individual security clearances of NATO SECRET. Only companies maintaining such facility and personnel clearances will be able to perform the resulting contract. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.

NC3A intends to use the one envelope bidding procedure, in which the price proposals are opened and evaluated and the bids ranked in order by lowest price. Technical evaluation then commences with the lowest priced bid until a fully compliant bid is found.

Bidders will be required to quote for the provision of ground, secure, and ECM resistant UHF radio infrastructure with the associated remote control capability, and with additional VHF- and UHF-band ancillary equipment to include hardware, software, documentation, testing, installation, training and transition on-site support. A minimum one-year warranty period will also be included for maintenance and support of the systems. Quotations will be on a fixed price basis for the total of the contract.

Bidders will be required to bid for UHF radios that are capable of operation using the Have Quick II standard. If SATURN radios are bid, they must be capable of operation in Have Quick II mode. If Have Quick II radios are bid, it must be possible to upgrade them to the SATURN standard while still retaining the capability to operate in the Have Quick II mode. In the latter case, the bidder will be required to quote for the related option referring to the upgrade of Have Quick II radios to SATURN. This option will be part of the evaluation.

The bidders will also be required to quote for options referring to additional equipment to be installed in additional sites in Hungary. The options will be part of the evaluation.

The solicitation will require the bidders to guarantee that the radio frequencies specified are compatible with the regulations and controls of the Nations and that National frequency clearances will be obtained as appropriate.

The bidders will need take into account that the installation must performed on existing sites, which have electromagnetic and infrastructure constraints.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 05 March 2007

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the IFB to those on the Bidders List: April 2007

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: July 2007

4. Anticipated contract award date: October 2007

Both projects are expected to be completed after 18 months from the Effective Date of Contract (EDC).

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Audit Services (OAS) has a requirement to renew its licensing agreement for a one year period with First Databank, San Bruno, CA 94066 for the use of its drug database service.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis for the use of the following licensed products: (1) National Drug Data File (NDDF); (2) Counseling Messages Module; (3) Drug Allergy Module; (4)Drug-Drug Interaction Module; (5) Drug-Food Interaction Module; (6) Drug Lab Interference Module; (7) Duplicate Therapy Module; (8) Minimum/Maximum Dose Module; (9) Patient Education Module (English); (10) Prioritized Label Warning Module; and (11) Medicare Module.

This acquisition shall be awarded in accordance with FAR Subpart 13  Simplified Acquisition Procedures and has been justified in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b).  The reviews that OAS conducts require access to Average Wholesale Prices (AWPs) for various dates.  First Databanks database provides drug pricing information for the use by State Medicaid Agencies in reimbursing pharmacies for prescription drugs.  The drug data file contains current AWPs for all drugs on the market, as well as historical AWPs.  The Government knows of no other source that has current and historical data in one file.  Additionally, due to recent legislative changes to the Medicare program, drugs are now covered under the new Part D program that took effect January 1, 2006.  As a result, OAS has increased its need for this product as it contains pricing and National Drug Code information, such as when responding to a recent Congressional request for OAS to evaluate reimbursement costs under the new Part D program.  The Centers for Medicare Services (CMS) has adopted this product as the official guide to pricing for drugs related to the new Part D program.

Interested concerns capable of providing products that contain the kinds of data contained in the 11 licensed products identified in the first paragraph may submit a capability statement outlining their products and the content of those products.  No solicitation is available.  Information received will be evaluated for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Following evaluation of capability statements, a determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received within 10 calendar days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer shall proceed with award to First DataBank.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command will be soliciting a proposal for support of the E/A-18G Aircraft in the area of Automated Maintenance Environment.  The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Boeing Company (MDC/Boeing) will be solicited for this requirement via the F/A-18 Integrated Readiness Support Team (FIRST) program. 

The FIRST Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract currently provides spares availability, asset repair management, engineering support, and integrated logistics support (ILS) of all F/A-18 Aircraft variants. The FIRST program demands aggressive pursuit of system reliability improvements through effective configuration and obsolescence management, technology insertion, and innovative product and support improvements. Various operational and repair sites are supported. Additionally, MDC/Boeing is also required to maintain CORE capability I/A/W U.S. Code 10 U.S.C 2464 through depot teaming arrangements with the NADEPs in North Island, Cherry Point, and Jacksonville under FIRST. 

The EA-18-G requirement is restricted to MDC/Boeing, the aircraft prime manufacturer, because MDC/Boeing is the only source that possesses the full range of technical data, much of which is proprietary, and other capabilities necessary to perform the effort. Further, MDC/Boeing is considered to be the only source that is capable of providing the required range of integrated program support. See Note 22*****

<DESC>This is for informational purposes only.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to solicit and negotiate, on a sole source basis, with each State or Territory, as an independent entity, to provide required data for the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) of the National Center of Health Statistics (NCHS) under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Data will be purchased from all States, NYC, DC, and five U.S. territories.   In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 242k, Section 306(h) of the Public Health Service Act , NCHS has a legislatively-mandated mission to produce national vital statistics based on annually collected data from the nation's birth, death, and fetal death records. The NVSS is a cooperative, decentralized system in which data from over 6 million vital events records are collected each year by all States, NYC, DC, and five U.S. territories and sent to NCHS for processing and dissemination.  The records are State owned, governed by State laws and regulations, and produced through State operated registration systems.  This highly specialized data is available from no other source than the identified State or Territory.  Each registration area has, by law, the exclusive authority to collect and record the events, and currently do so as a governmental function.  No state possesses legal or regulatory authority within another state?s jurisdiction.  As the sole entity authorized to and engaged in the collection of birth and death information, each state agency is uniquely and solely capable of providing the requisite data to the Government.  The NAICS Code is 519190. Interested parties may identify their capabilities by responding to this notice or by submitting a proposal. This is a notice of intent and not a request for proposals.  It is believed that data procured from the individual States or Territories meet the minimum needs of the Government and no other source for these services is known at this time.  This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.320-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Information furnished shall include enough detail information to allow the government to perform a proper evaluation. Respondents will not be notified of the evaluation results.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements.<BR><BR>IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as a key component of the Department's networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State's enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that require two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). Furthermore, APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system. The equipment listed in paragraph two (2) have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and are approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.<BR><BR>ADDED eSCORE WORKSHEET LINE ITEM AND ATTACHMENTS.<BR><BR>

IxChariot console Seat License, 10 concurrent users.  Software maintenance. 2) Identify the statutory authority permitting this non-competitive procurement : 6.302-1	Only one responsible source and No Other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements.  This software is the existing DTS-PO standard for service/network testing.  This is an upgrade/increase of software already in use by the DTS-PO.  Since the network has grown, more licenses are necessary to meet out testing needs.  This software must be used as a console/endpoint matching combination.  Other testing software does not interoperate with this software. 3) Describe the efforts that the COTR and Requesting Office made to ensure that the supplies/services describedabove could be solicited from as many potential sources as practicable: Other testing systems, both hardware and and software, were tested previously by the DTS-PO.  In addition, many other testing systems have been purchased and are in the DTS-PO lab.  They have been evaluated.  The Ixia Chariot software was chosen to best suit our distributed testing requirements. 4) Describe the market survey conducted and the results and attaché a copy if documented elsewhere, or provide a statement of the reasons market survey was not conducted.  When potential sources other than the company identified herin are available, identify the circumstances which preclude their solicitation for this requirement: This is an upgrade to our existing testing capability.  As the number of systems under test increase more licenses are needed.  Since the software is already in use within the DTS, only upgrades to the existing licenses are necessary.  These upgrades are only available from the creator/developer of the software.   5) Identify the Company’s unique qualifications or describe the circumstances of the procurement that justify the use of that authority. Ixia is the developer of the software.  It is no resold by other sellers. 6) Discuss any actions that could be taken to encourage competition for future acquisitions of similar supplies/services: The market for testing software is limited.  The government could encourage this vendor to offer their software for sale by other resellers and allow it to be bundled in other systems.<BR><BR>

Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements.<BR><BR>IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as a key component of the Department¿s networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State¿s enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that require two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). Furthermore, APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor¿s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department¿s requirements as a key component of the Department¿s networking system. The equipment listed in paragraph two (2) have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and are approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This notice is issued by the NASA/JSC to post a Request for Information (RFI) via the internet and to solicit information from Industry.  This document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the Government needs, as well as broaden industry participation in meeting government requirements.   &lt;br&gt; The National Aeronautics and Space Administration invites you to submit a response to this inquiry to assist in developing plans for the long-term management for Constellation data and defining evaluation criteria for identifying and comparing strategic plans, definitions, techniques, standards and implementation strategies that result in cost effective data architecture, management and sustainment over the multi-decade Constellation program.	Data architecture is defined as the collection and organization of information related to the product lines’ designs, build records, acceptance, testing, integration, quality assurance, verification, problem reporting, flight history, and mission-specific attributes and conditions.  NASA understands the synergistic and important relationships among data architecture, information technology and data management, and is therefore interested in ensuring that those three domains are clearly and logically integrated at the beginning of the Constellation program.  NASA recognizes that at the core of defining, developing, deploying and sustaining the long-term, complex Constellation program is a tremendous amount of data that is generated from programmatic and engineering processes.  This data must be effectively managed in order to provide timely and accurate information to the program’s designers, decision-makers and stakeholders.  To this end, emphasis is being placed on defining, integrating, and organizing program data, from manufacturing/integration/test through pre-launch processing, launch operations, mission operations, recovery and refurbishment and finally disposal of human-rated space vehicles.  It is imperative that the data architecture be proactively defined and developed in order to mitigate the issues typically associated with the transient nature of personnel and software applications (including software obsolescence).  Additional complexity results from the: 1) communications challenges associated with Lunar and, eventually, Martian operations; 2) utilization of legacy systems and their associated data; and 3) security/sensitive aspects of the data.  The data architecture needs to be designed, modeled, analyzed, reviewed and improved just as systematically as the flight hardware and software designs.	Thus, NASA will be developing the Constellation data architecture through the use of data maps/diagrams and models that will be used to describe and continuously analyze the data architecture.  These are intended to fully describe the type, producer, consumer(s), location, temporal nature (e.g., frequency of deliveries and/or updates), pedigree, and authority of the data, including its relationship with other data items.  The framework or structure of diagrams and resulting models will provide a disciplined and structured method to capturing and organizing the program data.  It is expected that this type of approach will provide life cycle cost savings that result from the ability to quickly access data, provide the ability to understand the relationships among data (i.e., cause and affect), and create and organize information.  NASA recognizes the advances of industry in achieving well-defined data architectures.  Industry’s techniques for applying appropriate information technology for data management, defining and using standards/protocols for describing data and modeling the data relationships across numerous organizations and systems provide a tremendous advantage and opportunity over prior generations in addressing this important area.  The specific objective of this RFI is to request information on the full scope of activities, tools, models, and evaluation criteria used to define, collect/acquire, manage and govern the data architecture in order to improve the long-term operations and life-cycle affordability of the overall Constellation Program.	Responses are requested to any or all of the following topics: 1.	Organizational Structure.   Where in a company's organization should data architecture efforts be based?	Similarly, who should lead data architect efforts (possible options include the Chief Technology Officer, the Chief Information Officer, or Information Technology Director, or perhaps someone else)? 2.	Milestones.  Which project milestones are best associated with the planning of which aspects of manufacturing, test, integration, operation and sustainment of the data architecture?  What should the maturity level be for the manufacturing, test, integration, operation and sustainment data architecture at each of the project milestones? 3.	Modeling.  What are the current and emerging industry standards and protocols for defining, describing and modeling a program’s data architecture? 4.	Technology.  What particular tools and technologies are available to implement the recommended standards and protocols?  What processes are key to valid “make versus buy” trade studies?  What approaches are best for integrating disparate commercial tools? 5.	Requirements and Governance.  What are the key requirements, agreements and processes that need to be levied upon organizations (government and contractor), or communities of practice, across the program lifecycle to ensure a proactive and timely development and evolution of the data architecture, and continuous access to the data? 6.	Culture Change.  What are some key approaches to facilitating the cultural change necessary to effectively develop and manage to a data-centric organization and program life-cycle? 7.	Cost.  To what degree is data architecture the key to minimizing lifecycle cost? 8.	Success.  Are there preferred best practices or approaches to data architecture that can assure a successful outcome? 9.	Vision.  What would the data architecture for Constellation notionally look like and how would it evolve over the next 15-20 years?  Please provide a notional description or diagram.  NASA JSC is requesting information that responds to any or all of the above topics.  Additionally, responses must include the following: name and address of firm; size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; and whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, woman-owned, veteran owned, and/or service disabled veteran owned. &lt;br&gt; All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled and protected accordingly.  NASA will likely provide proprietary information to its support service contractors who are under an obligation to keep third-party Proprietary information in confidence.	By submitting a response to this RFI, the responder is deemed to have consented to release of Proprietary information to such NASA support service contractors.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is Industry’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This is a request for information only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) will take procurement action in this matter.  Further, neither NASA JSC nor the government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.  Respondents will not be notified of the results.  Interested parties are invited to submit written comments or questions to: Tiffany Sullivan via email (preferred) or by facsimile transmission, no later than March 1, 2007.  When responding, please reference BT-CPDA-RFI and your company name.

<SOLNBR>REQUEST-FOR-INFORMATION

<ARCHDATE>04152007
<CONTACT>akilah.ray, 732-532-5489
<DESC>Request for Information Title: Market Survey for Common Viewer Application Framework (CVAF) Technical POC Address Project Manager Battle Command (PM BC), ATTN: Henry Saphow, Building 2525, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703.  E-Mail: henry.saphow@us.army.mil  This Request for Information (RFI) is issued to survey the commercial services market for potential reuse of COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) software to be integrated into the U.S. Army Battle Command (BC) architecture in support of the U.S. Army Project M anager Battle Command (PM BC) for existing application frameworks that can serve as a Common Viewer Application Framework (CVAF). Description: Army BC is a System of Systems comprised of the following tactical component: Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS), Communications/System Network and Hardware Enablers.  As Army migrates to Network Enabled Command Capability (NECC), based in part on the net- centric Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), steps leading to that objective architecture required changes in the ABCS architecture.  A near-term BC core architecture has been defined.  The core architecture will be based on Microsoft Vista operating syste m, supported by the BC Common Services (BCCS), Common Security, and CVAF. A Common Viewer smart client will be built using a CVAF. The Common Viewer smart client will serve as a template platform for deploying Army and Marine applications. CVAF is a techno logy and infrastructure centric framework and should not be confused with the Common Viewer Usability Engineering Framework being developed under the auspices of the OSD-sponsored Technology Transition Initiative (TTI) project.  The latter effort is techno logy agnostic and is focused on developing a human factors centric framework. Operationally the CVAF is expected to operate on a common operating system (MS Windows Vista) and utilize a common set of tools, such as GIS/map data rendering.  A Common Viewer smart client, regardless of battlefield functional area, will run on top of the CVAF.  As an example a Maneuver or Fires user may log onto the common viewer platform running a common operating system (Vista) and common application framework, then launch specific Maneuver or Fires applications within the application framework.  Aft er loading the plug-in into the CVAF, the user has the ability (from the same user interface provided by the CVAF to share data and events across other loaded plug-ins already running in the CVAF.   The CVAF will be consistent across the Army and Marine Land Force commanders and initially will be managed at the tactical level. These systems will use smart and thin client technology to access data and services available in the network. Smart clients wi ll provide a rich user experience by using services and data on the network when connected and cache data for use during off-line operations; thin clients provide web-based capabilities during connected operations.  The CVAF will support Common Services an d user configurable to support functional domain-unique services (i.e. Fires and Effects).  The CVAF shall enable smart clients that supports a common user interface (UI), a plug-in architecture, application collaboration, data sharing and GIS functionality using ESRI/CJMTK tools. The CVAF shall support a product line like concept that will enabl e capabilities to be built on-top of the framework as components/widgets. The framework will allow these components to be integrated by end system developers. This enables C4ISR developers to share and develop specific domain capabilities. The goal is for these components to be controlled, but also open source so that end system developers can enhance the components as needed. Some important characteristics of CVAF are: software availability, work disconnected, cache data locally, perform client side processing, Software Development Kit (SDK) availability, use of a Commercial Joint Mapping Tool Kit (ESRI/CJMTK) services, Plug-in  Architec ture (third party products), a data model architecture for application to application, and Collaboration across machines.  Attached is a questionnaire asking whether your product supports characteristics presented.  Although it is not expected that all cha racteristics will be supported initially by a single product, the above characteristics, in addition to the life cycle cost will be a determining factor for the government to consider the product.  Instructions: This is a Request for Information only.  This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP). Interested parties should respond in a complete manner as possible to the 26 key factors below for the CVAF. For the technical question the how it can be accomplished is i mportant key as well.  Please reply in a short paragraphs what keys factors your software supports.  No special submission format is required (electronic format is preferred).  For additional information on your product, you may attach any pertinent commer cial literature/briefings that you maintain. The government will not reimburse contractors or responders to this notice for any costs incurred in responding, or in subsequent exchange of information. All proprietary and restricted information shall be clea rly marked. Please respond no later than COB 14 February 2007.  POC is Henry Saphow (henry.saphow@us.army.mil). Key Factors: 1 - Software Licensing 2 - Support Smart client framework (see note 1 ) 3 - Collaboration across machines IVIC (Intelligent Virtual Information Collaboration) (see note 2) 4 - Collaboration across machines (chat) (see note 2.1) 5 - Collaboration across machines (files) (see note 2.1) 6 - Collaboration across machines (video)(see note 2.1) 7 - Collaboration across machines (voice) (see note 2.1) 8 - Collaboration across machines (whiteboarding) (see note 2.1) 9 - Adaptable to other (3rd party) plug-in/tools (weather, terrain analysis, Microsoft products) (see note 3) 10 - Search multiple database (SQL) sources and display from them in both map graphical and tabular 11 - Developer  modifiable User Interface 12 - GIS  Renderer All ESRI/CJMTK Supported Map Data Products (Vector & Raster) 13 - GIS  Ability to Perform ESRI/CJMTK Analysis 14 - GIS  Read and Write to ESRI/CJMTK Geo Database 15 - GIS  Use ESRI/CJMTK Symbology Such as MOLE 16 - Hardware requirements (Client/Server/Network) 17 - Display COP/UDOP (see note 4) 18 - Language written 19 - Platform (Windows, Linux, other Unix) 20 - SDK available 21 - Software maturity  22 - User Base (commercial, military) 23 - User defined environment (see note 5) 24 - Network Performance (see note 6) 25 - Data Mining (see note 7) 26 - Software Schedule/availability Explanation/Definition: Note 1. Smart Client is an application that uses local resources and provides a rich user experience; it's a connected application that exchanges data on the Internet or an enterprise network; even though it's a connected application, it is offline capable  so that it can be used whether or not it is currently connected; and it has an intelligent deployment and update story, maintaining relatively the same ease of deployment and management as web applications. Note 2. Collaboration across machines IVIC (Intelligent Virtual Information Collaboration) is a method when all permitted parties (smart clients) have direct access to the information and can view, modify, annotate, and contribute to it at the finest grain  level (a unit on a map rather than a picture of the map itself). Data with information moves seamlessly among all users regardless of what visual format it is displayed in (maps, schedules, charts, etc.).  Items of interest can be highlighted and created new visualizations with different combinations of data in various visualization types such as geo-referenced, time based or worksheet views.  Combined with an intuitive, easy to use interface, this enables users to express their thoughts more completely fr om distan t locations. Note 2.1 Does the framework have built in support for these forms of collaboration or can it integrate or coexist with 3rd party solutions that perform these collaboration services? If so how? Note 3. Adaptable to other plug-in/tools via the use of open standards (i.e.  XML/SOAP-based web-service) Note 4. Display COP/UDOP. Common Operating Picture and User Defined Operating Picture are terminology used by the DoD to describe what commander can see on his workstation.  For this requirement we need to understand if any external DoD interfaces are supp orted that will allow working with the ESRI/CJMTK to render units, geometries and other graphics that are interfaced from external DoD systems in 2D/3D. Note 5. User defined environment- provide capability for the operator to select multiple views on multiple screens or on a single screen.  User generated new views either tabular, map and graphic Note 6.  Network performance for a smart client in a connected mode such as: information display latency, performance over low bandwidth (less than 1 mb/s), intermittent connectivity behavior, etc. Note 7. Data mining is the process of automatically searching large volumes of data for patterns (i.e. clustering, classification, defined rules, etc.) Does this CVAF possess any inherent capabilities to data mine based on the framework architecture?

<SUBJECT>A -- High Temperature Electrolysis of Steam
<DESC>Under the US Department of Energy sponsorship, the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is conducting research to generate hydrogen using solid oxide cells by high temperature (~830?C) electrolysis (HTE) of steam.  In another parallel project, the INL is investigating the feasibility of producing syngas by simultaneously electrolyzing steam and carbon dioxide at high temperature (~830?C) using solid oxide cells.  The syngas initial research has been funded by INL internal laboratory research and development funds. The INL is soliciting interest from developers and manufacturers to collaborate with the INL in testing solid oxide cell designs under HTE conditions and to evaluate the scalability of cell designs required for commercial applications.  Participating companies will be expected to provide solid oxide cells (as a in-kind contribution or at a nominal cost) to the INL for the test period.  It is unlikely that any (or a significant amount of) DOE funding will be available for the participating company(ies) for their participation in this research.  Companies having interest in collaborating with the INL should provide an expression of interest on or before March 31, 2007.

<SUBJECT>PEO-IWS Library, Software, Hardware Asset Reuse Enterprise (SHARE)
<DESC>In August 2006, the Program Executive Officer, Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO-IWS) established a library of combat system software and related assets for use by eligible contractors (both prime contractors and subcontractors) for developing or suggesting improvements to Navy Surface Warfare Systems.  The PEO-IWS library, Software, Hardware Asset Reuse for the Enterprise (SHARE) is presently being populated. As of January 2007, assets and artifacts from the Aegis, Ship Self Defense System (SSDS), Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), and DDG-1000 programs are available in the SHARE library.  PEO-IWS encourages all current Navy contractors and potential Navy contractors to register for access to the SHARE library to discover the assets it presently contains as well as to contribute assets that may be useful to the Navy and its contracting community in the future. Access to the library is restricted to contractors that are participating as a prime or subcontractor in active Navy contracts that include warfare or weapons system software maintenance or development.  Contractors that do not hold an active Navy warfare or weapon systems software or maintenance contract may be granted access by entering into a Cooperative Research and Development agreement with a Navy activity.  Access shall require “Secret” facility and personnel clearance and a DD Form 254.  Access to, and employment of, SHARE assets shall be for Government Purposes Only.  Access is voluntary and there is no warranty associated with assets contained in the library. Contractors requesting access to assets within the library shall be required to execute a license (terms of use agreement) and a non disclosure agreement for those assets.  Contractors shall also be required to provide a written justification for the need to access classified information.  The justification shall, at a minimum include identification of the Navy contract under which the contractor is requesting access as a prime or subcontractor, a description of the work being performed, identification of what asset or functional aspect of any asset they are requesting access to, and the relationship between the requested asset and the work they are performing under its Navy contract. Those companies interested in registering for access to the library should visit and complete an on-line registration form at https://viewnet.nswc.navy.mil.  To register for an account, click on the “Register your CAC or Digital Certificate for Access” link, select “SHARE” as your program of interest, and complete the form. This unclassified site provides a mechanism to discover library materials that are available within SHARE, as those materials are populated.  The site also hosts the license agreement and NDA that are required for obtaining library materials.  Library materials will be provided either on-line through access to the appropriate portion of the SHARE web site (classified or unclassified) or via delivery of physical media. The registration process for the classified portion of the site over SIPRNET (https://viewnet.nswcdd.navy.smil.mil) is the same as the unclassified portion above, except no digital certificate is required. [Note:  The unclassified site URL may not be accessible to your company due to IP filtering.  If that is the case, please contact the helpdesk at 540-663-4507 and provide them with the IP address(es) you will be using to access the site.] THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.      Point of Contact Please contact via email in lieu of telephone calls richard.goff@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>D -- Fiesta Crow 2007
<DESC>SUBJECT: FIESTACROW 07: ? ?Network Warfare and Non-Traditional EW ? Combat in the Digital Age?

Description: The Billy Mitchell Chapter (BMC) of the Association of Old Crows, along with support from the Joint Information Operations Warfare Command, the Air Force Information Operations Center, Air Intelligence Agency, the 67th Network Warfare Wing, NSA/CSS Texas, the 563 Flying Training Squadron and the Alamo Chapter of AFCEA, will present the 15th FIESTACROW technical symposium. FIESTACROW 07 will be held April 23-26, 2007 in San Antonio, Texas.  The theme of the symposium is ?Network Warfare and Non-Traditional EW ? Combat in the Digital Age?.  In the Global War on Terrorism, protecting our critical infrastructures has never been more challenging.  The ability to identify the individuals, groups, or nation states that promote attacking our networks, infrastructures, and US forces, and fighting back to stop these attacks has become a major priority of the US government.  In the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, the President states ?The policy of the United States is to protect against the debilitating disruption of the operation of information systems for critical infrastructures and, thereby, help to protect the people, economy, and national security of the United States.  We must act to reduce our vulnerabilities to these threats before they can be exploited ? and ensure that such disruptions ? are infrequent, of minimal duration, manageable, and cause the least damage possible.?  With the rapid advancement of new technology, the US and its allies are quickly moving from wired to wireless networks.  The result is a blurring of the traditional difference of EW and NW techniques with the result that both are now needed to protect US forces and infrastructure.  This leading edge technical program will explore topics within this broad category.
Speakers for the program include: General James Cartwright, Commander, Strategic Command; Lt Gen Michael Peterson, SAF/XC; Maj Gen John Koziol, Commander, Joint Information Operations Warfare Command and Commander, Air Intelligence Agency; Brig Gen Jan-Marc Jouas, Vice-Commander Air Intelligence Agency, Col Laurie Buckhout, Chief, EW Division, HQDA G3; Col Blane Clark, Chief, IO Div, J3 USCENTCOM; Col Donald Bacon, Commander, 55 ECG; Lt Col Marshall Denney, Commander, VMAQ-3; Dr Dan Kuehl, National Defense University; and Dr Gregory White, Director, Center for Infrastructure Assurance and Security ? UTSA.  In conjunction with the technical sessions, there will be no-cost tutorial sessions on Tuesday.  The tutorials will include: ?The Deadly Side of Information Operations? presented by Dr. Frank Goldstein, Col USAF (Ret.); ?Preparing a Community for Cyber Attack? by Dr. Gregory White; and a short presentation on San Antonio business opportunities entitled ?San Antonio, An Economic Success? by Mr. Mario Hernadez, President of the San Antonio Economic Development Foundation. Visit the Fiestacrow Web site: http://www.fiestacrow.com. for update information the location, times and presenter information for both the technical session and tutorials. 

The exhibits area will be open Monday, April 23, 4:00 PM ? 7:00 PM, Tuesday, April 24, 12:00 PM ? 6:00 PM, and Wednesday, April 25, 11:00AM ? 6:00 PM.  Following FIESTACROW, an Industry Day with participants from Air Intelligence Agency, the Joint Information Operations Warfare Command, the Air Force Information Operations Center, the National Security Agency, and the City of San Antonio will be held on Thursday morning, 26 April, at the convention center.
.

 FIESTACROW 07 technical program, as usual, is held in conjunction with the San Antonio Fiesta. Coupled with the San Antonio hospitality during Fiesta, the parties that surround it, the River Parade and an elegant Grand Banquet, this is one event not to be missed.
For information on FIESTACROW 07, contact the Billy Mitchell Chapter at 210-732-7697 or visit the web site, http//www.FiestaCrow.com.

6)	Description:

The U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) is requesting abstracts and industry day participation relating to the Counter Communications System Block 20 program.  CCS Block 20 is a second generation, follow-on system to CCS Block 10.  

To facilitate FY07 acquisition activities, the CCS Block 20 Industry Day is scheduled for 27 and 28 February 2007 at the A-8 Auditorium of The Aerospace Corporation, 2350 E. El Segundo Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245.  At this Industry Day, the Government team will brief attending contractors on the goals and potential strategies for acquiring the CCS Block 20 system (morning session 27 Feb). No meals will be served at the conference center. 

As funded in the Future Year Defense Program (FYDP), CCS Block 20 is currently in its Concept Development Phase.  The overall program objective is to provide ground-based Offensive Counterspace (OCS) capability.  The Block 20 System will improve the ability to deny, disrupt and deceive an adversary?s centralized Command, Control Communications and Intelligence (C3I).  The basic CCS concept is to provide a core system that is flexible, modular, scaleable and rapidly deployable with a key set of signal generation capabilities and a robust transmit capability.  Its architecture will have the flexibility to host additional core capabilities and/or more sophisticated "plug and play" type modules.  This capability is necessary to rapidly address the ever increasing number of technologies and assets available to our adversaries and support in the integration of new, dynamic OCS technologies.  

CCS Block 20 will be acquired in an evolutionary acquisition approach where the end-state described above will be the guidepost for systems engineering and integration efforts leading to the required OCS capability.  The Preliminary Design Phase of CCS Block 20 is planned to begin in Government Fiscal Year (FY) 2009.  The current CCS Block 10 system may or may not be the baseline for an evolutionary upgrade strategy to deliver CCS Block 20 capability. 

In preparation for the Preliminary Design Phase, SYSW is planning to award one or more Concept Development contracts (~$5M) in early-FY 2008.  The focus of these contracts will be to analyze and propose system-level requirements based on the Technical Requirements Document (TRD), perform specific trade studies and analysis and conduct a System Requirements Review (SRR) and System Design Review (SDR) in preparation for Key Decision Point B (KDP-B). 

As part of program concept development, SYSW invites, but does not require industry partners to submit abstracts.  If prepared, the abstracts should address the preparing company's relevant experience and lessons learned citing particular programs including prime contractor performance, subcontractor management, successful development and integration of ground based and mobile OCS systems, COTS RF integration, RF signal processing techniques in support of the Counterspace mission, RF systems automation, evolutionary development and continuous upgrades.  The principle thrust of the abstracts should be the company?s ideas on COTS-based, modular solutions that minimize the development of new technologies and hardware.  Abstracts should be no more than 12 pages and submitted no later than 26 February 2007.  Submission of an abstract is not a prerequisite for participation at the Industry Day. Classified abstracts shall be submitted via classified fax to (310) 416-1704 or 1705, Attention: Jim Austin.  Unclassified abstracts shall be faxed to (310) 416-1725, Attention: Capt Ross Johnston, mail to Capt Ross Johnston, SYSW/CJD, 483 N Aviation Blvd. A-5, El Segundo, CA 90245, or email to ross.johnston@losangles.af.mil.

The CCS Block 20 project team will also conduct one-on-one discussions with interested parties. Each one-on-one session will be limited to 45 minutes and will be limited to four (4) individuals per contractor team.  The one-on-one sessions may be shortened depending on the number of interested contractors. One-on-one sessions will be held on the afternoon of 27 February and on 28 February 2007 if necessary. 

Industry Day attendees must be U.S. citizens and must possess a DoD Final SECRET security clearance. Visit certifications shall be sent via JPAS to SMO Code SYS WING Attention Steve Taylor or through your supporting SSO to SSO SMC//INS// with passing instruction to SYSW/AS Stephen Taylor 310-416-1618 or Jim Austin (310) 416-1645. Additional accesses required for presentations/discussions in the one-on-one sessions will be sent to Jim Austin at FAX # (310) 416-1704 or 1705.  ALL clearances MUST be received NLT 20 February 2007.

BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Mr. John Wagner, SMC/DS.  You can reach him at john.wagner@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-2138.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Zig-Zag Nd:Glass Laser
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Zig-Zag Nd:Glass Laser


Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license and commercialize its Zig-Zag Nd:Glass Laser System technology.

Background: The Laser Systems Group at LLNL has developed a high energy, high average power solid state laser system capable of performing production rate laser shot peening. 

Description:   LLNL?s system consists of one or more flashlamp-pumped Nd:glass zig-zag amplifiers, a very low threshold stimulated-Brillouin-scattering (SBS) phase conjugator system, and a free-running single frequency Nd:YLF master oscillator.

Advantages:  The LLNL system is the only laser in existence with the energy, peak and average power required for production applications of this process. Completely passive polarization switching provides eight amplifier gain passes. Multiple frequency output can be generated by using SBS cells having different pressures of a gaseous SBS medium or different SBS materials.

Potential Applications:  LLNL?s long pulse, low divergence, narrow-bandwidth, multi-frequency output laser system with its high average power and high beam quality has an unique application in pumping another laser.

Development Status:  LLNL has issued patents covering its Zig-Zag Nd:Glass Laser System technology:   U.S. Patent Nos. 5,239,408, 5,689,363, and 6,385,228.

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

 
Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Zig-Zag Nd:Glass Laser System technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
P.O. Box 808, L-795
Livermore, CA  94551-0808
Attention:  FBO 147-07

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Zig-zag Nd:Glass Laser technology.

<SUBJECT>73 -- FSC  7350 Tableware
<DESC>FedBizOpps Notice 
FPI Production of Tableware
FSC code 7350



In furtherance of the FPI Board of Directors? directive to seek and pursue the creation of inmate jobs without mandatory source, a notice was published in the December 21, 1998 edition of the Commerce Business Daily(CBD) regarding FPI?s production of products for the Federal government on a competitive (non-mandatory) basis.  The notice stated that the Board of Directors had granted approval for FPI to competitively bid on products for which it did not rely on its mandatory source of supply.  Under this procedure, FPI would not follow the public involvement guidelines process established by 18.U.S.C. 4122(b) which is required for new products FPI offers as a mandatory source.  FPI is required to publish a notice of its intentions to competitively produce a product purchased by the Federal government.  

This notice announces FPI?s intentions to produce tableware which would include cups and trays for federal agencies on a competitive basis and not use its mandatory source status.  These products encompasses all plastic tableware classified in Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 7350 - Tableware.  

Once a product is sold competitively, by FPI, it remains a competitive product and will never be added to FPI?s Schedule of Products as a mandatory source product.  FPI will not attempt to exercise its mandatory source at some future point in time nor seek from its Board of Directors to expand production of the product by invoking the guidelines process at some later date.  It has been previously determined by the FPI Board of Directors that whatever share of the market FPI acquires on a competitive basis will be deemed to be a reasonable share of the market within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 4122(b)(2).  Sales of products manufactured under this procedure will be tracked and recorded separately by FPI as is the case for subcontracting and services.

Interested parties have a right to comment or raise questions with FPI?s Board of Directors.  All written correspondence should be addressed to:  Chief, Strategic Business Development and Marketing Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to:

 It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-14, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS DCN 20070122 and Defense Logistics Acquisition Directive (DLAD) CURRENT TO Revision 5 and Proc Ltr 2007-03.

This solicitation is 100% set aside for 8(a) business concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 335911 and the associated size standard is 500 employees to be classified as a small business concern.

In accordance with FAR 19.102(f)(4), a SBA class waiver applies to this procurement.  An exemption from the nonmanufacturer rule applies.  Any 8(a) company (nonmanufacturer) may respond and does not have to furnish the product of a small business manufacturer.

Contractor shall provide delivery schedule - __________ days after receipt of purchase order.

52.233-9000 Agency Protests.
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity?s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.

52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
 (a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel ( see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

FAR provision 52.212-2 - Evaluation ? Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.  The Government intends to award one contract as a result of this Request for Quotation.

Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements.<BR><BR>IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as a key component of the Department’s networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State’s enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that require two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).  Furthermore, APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The equipment listed in paragraph two (2) have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and are approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.<BR><BR>
