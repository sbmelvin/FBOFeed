<DESC>USAID/Dominican Republic’s 2002-2007 Country Strategy for Education counts on private sector contributions towards the improvement of Basic Education in public schools.  The ultimate goal of the strategy is to promote an increase in the quantity and quality of interactions among the school, its surrounding community, and local/national organizations interested in the educational process.  The full impact of USAID programs in public schools can only be determined through a careful monitoring and evaluation plan that will track differences in learning in that student population benefiting from such programs.

The USAID/DR Mission would like to receive proposals from qualified organizations in response to the need for a Monitoring and Evaluation system for selected schools that should include, but not be limited to: 

·	educational testing to determine changes in learning outcomes;
·	evaluations of substantive community involvement in school-related activities;
·	application of survey instruments for opportunities to learn;
·	on-going assessments of the policy environment directly conducive to enhanced private sector involvement in public education; and
·	active collaboration in monitoring and evaluation between the Ministry of Education and private institutions involved in education.

<DESC>Subject to final approval, the Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt, on behalf of the Inter-American Foundation (IAF), intends to award a sole source contract to Dr. Lester M. Salamon of the Johns Hopkins University for Policy Studies.  The service required is the performance of a systematic assessment of corporate social responsibility and of corporate-third sector ties in the developing countries of Latin America.  The contract is to determine whether a distinctive Latin American style of business-third sector interaction is evolving and, if so, what its characteristic features are.

The requirements of this contract shall proceed in three overlapping phases. These include, but are not limited to:  1) the creation of a bibliography on corporate social responsibility, corporate philanthropy, and business non-profit relations; a compilation of materials dealing with historic traditions and recent trends in Latin American business, and the assembly of relevant project documents generated by the IAF on corporate social responsibility and corporate non-profit partnerships projects that it has funded;  
2) the designation of four to six projects in each of at least three or four countries for detailed analysis; project-focused interviews with participants in selected corporate social responsibility and corporate third-sector partnership projects, coupled with participant observation in the targeted projects; and general interviews with relevant observers of corporate third-sector relationships as they have evolved in the countries selected; and an analysis of these materials to identify leading hypothesis and perspectives as well as substantive findings that can be incorporated into a resulting publishable manuscript;  3) the analysis of the material collected and preparation of a publishable manuscript incorporating the findings in the IAF’s  journal Grassroots Development.  The contract will be for one year with two option year periods.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541720 (Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities) and the small business size standard is $6.0 million.  The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 15 days after publication of this notice.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient technical detail and clarification to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement or functional equivalent, at terms more advantageous to the Government.  A request for documentation will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to make a sole-source award to Dr. Lester M. Salamon.

<DESC>This is an announcement of the US DOC/NOAA/NMAO standard competition of the Electronics Technician (ET) Services of the Marine Operations Centers (MOC).  NOAA is conducting a standard competition in accordance with OMB Circular A-76, dated May 29, 2003. This A-76 cost comparison study will examine the possibility of converting Government "in-house" operations to contractor operations. A cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the following services and related functions performed by Government personnel to contract performance will be conducted. Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have the Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified. Nationwide, approximately 37 Full Time Equivalent ET positions and two FTE of Administrative Support positions are affected by this competition.

The competition will include services that are currently performed by Government personnel at sea aboard NOAA vessels and in various NMAO Marine Operations Center locations including, but not limited to, Norfolk, VA; Seattle, WA; Honolulu, HI; Pascagoula, MS; and Woods Hole, MA. Services being competed include preventive and corrective maintenance and installations on all the various types of electronic equipment and systems used on NOAA Hydrographic Survey and Fisheries and Oceanographic research ships. Typical functions to be performed include assessing maintenance requirements and determining resources required to repair and/or install equipment; preparing service reports and installation plans; repairing equipment using schematics, vendor documents and test equipment; and verifying repair or performing acceptance tests of returned/repaired equipment; configuring, operating and administering the NOAA Scientific Computer System (SCS) and email servers. The systems include, but are not limited to: navigation systems, acoustic systems, communications systems, oceanographic/ atmospheric instruments, personal computers, network servers and local area network components. 

The Acting Competitive Sourcing Official for NOAA/NMAO study is Helen Hurcombe. Francis J. Colohan is the Agency Tender Official. The Contracting Officer is Joel Perlroth, Joel.L.Perlroth@noaa.gov. 

In accordance with OMB Circular A-76, the U.S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration will be issuing a Request for Proposal for shipboard and shore side electronics technician services. Full details of the work requirements will be in the Performance Work Statement included as part of the solicitation. In accordance with OMB Circular A-76, it is anticipated that a Phased Evaluation Source Selection process will be used. The NAICS Code is 811219. As a result of this study it is the Government's intent to award a service provider agreement (contract, fee-for-service or letter of obligation) with a base period of one year and four one-year option periods. This solicitation will not result in a contract if Government performance is determined to be more advantageous. The anticipated solicitation release date is March  29, 2004.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS
The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB CA., has a requirement for a more robust and secure Flight Termination System. The systems in use today rely on obsolete technologies and provide limited protection against unauthorized users and signal interference. The Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) program will address existing system deficiencies with modern digital communication techniques that allow data link authentication and encryption. Test ranges, and in particular the AFFTC, use flight termination systems to control errant test vehicles and munitions. In the case where a vehicle malfunctions, ground transmitters issues “TERMINATE” commands to the vehicle to place it in a known state; typically a zero thrust, zero lift condition. The subsystem that receives and processes the command signals is called a flight termination receiver. The EFTS receiver will provide a number of improvements over traditional flight termination receivers to include; greater security, improved immunity to interference, enhanced maintenance and operations, and increased mission capabilities. These improvements will be accomplished by way of a digital message format and the Continuous Phase Frequency Shift Keying (CPFSK) modulation scheme. More specifically, the new digital approach facilitates message authentication, encryption and Forward Error Control (FEC).   

The Directorate of Contracting, AFFTC/PKD,  will release a Draft Request For Proposal (DRFP) for the modification of commercial flight termination receivers that support the new EFTS requirements on or about 15 October 2003. The requirement includes 1 modified engineering design unit, 6 test units, and an estimated 200 operational units. Also included in the anticipated 5 yr. indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity, commercial contract will be maintenance/repair, modfications/upgrades and data. The Government anticipates multiple award of contracts. This will be an unrestricted acquisition. NAICS code is 334220 and the Small Business Size Standard is 750 employees.  The estimated release date of the final RFP is 15 November 2003. An Industry Briefing will be held on 22 October 2003 at the International Telemetering Conference in Las Vegas NV at the Riviera Hotel and Convention Center. 
This is not a solicitation. Only a notice of a pending solicitation and requires no response.

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. 

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that do not issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.
 

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>Request for Proposals (RFP) N01-CN-25000-39, entitled:  Phase 1 and Phase 2 Clinical Trials of Cancer Chemopreventive Agents

The Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking proposals from qualified organizations who have the ability to conduct early phase clinical trials  and who have the ability to accrue a specified number of subjects per year. The main objectives of the contracts that will be awarded as a result of this solicitation will be the conduct of multiple early phase clinical trials of NCI/DCP-sponsored cancer preventive agents and the establishment of infrastructures composed of one or more collaborating institutions that will perform these trials.  These contracts will replace the current Phase 1 and Phase 2 Clinical Trials of Cancer Chemopreventive Agents Master Agreement pools. The trials conducted under the new contracts will assess the cancer preventive potential of various agents by evaluating the biologic effects of these agents on their molecular targets and by determining clinically relevant correlates.  Major emphasis will be on phase 2 preliminary efficacy studies, although phase 1 pharmacokinetic and safety studies as well as pilot studies exploring combinations of agents,  for which individual toxicities are known, will also be supported.  The agents to be studied shall include agents developed by the pharmaceutical industry and provided to the NCI for collaborative development as well as commercially available agents and agents developed by the NCI.  NCI/DCP requires a total contract pool that will provide 500 to 1000 study participants accrued to phase 2 and phase 1 (if applicable) trials per year.  NCI/DCP intends to make multiple contract awards under this program. The contract will consist of a base period of three years plus two option periods of one year each.  The Contractor shall initiate 1 to 5 clinical trials each year, with the intent of accruing 75-150 subjects (a minimum of 75 subjects required, but with option to accrue greater numbers) into NCI/DCP-sponsored trials each year. Within each base year/period (years 1 -3) of the contract as well as within option year/period 1 and option year/period 2, the Government shall have the option to fund an additional 25 or 50 study participants (over and above the 75 patient minimum).  Investigators are encouraged to work together and to seek collaborations within and outside their institutions in order to enhance their proposal.  Since an individual institution may be awarded only one contract, investigators at institutions capable of performing studies in multiple organ sites are encouraged to work together to present a single proposal.  Capacity to perform studies in multiple organs (i.e., more than 2) will be considered a valuable asset.  The North American Industry Classification System (NIACS) code is 541710. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued ELECTRONICALLY approximately March 5, 2002.  The RFP will be available on the Research Contracts Branch (RCB) website at : http://rcb.nci.nih.gov     Click on:  Current Requests for Proposals.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above internet site for the release of this solicitation and amendments, if any.  POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.  Point of contact: Theresa H.

It is the Government’s position that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirement.  Therefore, no other offers will be accepted.  The contract duration is approximately 365 days.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) intends to establish an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for WSR-88D Tower Inspection and Engineering Evaluation Services, Structural Repair and Replacement Services, Restoration of Galvanic Coating Services, Supplies and Materials, and Engineering Data.  The contract is anticipated to be awarded for a base year and four (4) one-year options.  GENERAL: The WSR-88D Radar Operations Center (ROC) has support management responsibility for the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1998 Doppler (WSR-88D) weather radar systems for the tri-agency NEXRAD Program.  Part of the support management responsibility associated with these radars is the maintenance of the tower structure in a fully operational condition to ensure the mission of the tri-agency radar network can be continuously met.  Timeliness of tower repairs, both routine as well as catastrophic failure recovery, is critical to the successful completion of the NEXRAD tri-agency mission.   The NEXRAD program has deployed 158 operational and 3 non-operational (training, test, and repair) towers.  The design and engineering data for the WSR-88D Towers are the proprietary property of Valmont-Microflect (CAGE: 29189).  The WSR-88D Tower, its subsystems, and component parts are manufactured by Valmont-Microflect.   The Government does not have any technical information associated with the Tower except site unique as-built drawings.  Each site is unique and Valmont-Microflect has designated unique Tower drawing numbers for every WSR-88D site within these packages.   It is necessary to periodically inspect the soundness of the tower at all WSR-88D sites which are constantly exposed to the environmental extremes.   It may be necessary to conduct impromptu inspections of radar towers which have been damaged or suspected to have been damaged by a catastrophic event.  Additionally, some towers are located at remote mountainous sites with severe weather environments where the wind and ice loading are excessive.  These sites are only accessible at certain times of the year for a limited period of time and require frequent maintenance.  Timeliness of inspection and subsequent repair are critical in these situations to restore the WSR-88D tower to its original operational condition.  WSR-88D radars must be 96% operationally available in order to meet the diverse meteorological missions of the NEXRAD tri-agency partners.   SPECIFIC: This proposed IDIQ contract provides for initial WSR-88D tower inspection and engineering evaluation services.  Based on the results of these evaluation services, this contract will provide for the WSR-88D tower repair services for timely restoration of the inspected tower to its original condition, restoration of galvanic coating, and WSR-88D tower supplies and materials required for restoration of the inspected tower to its original condition.  Finally, the work under this contract provides for the delivery of WSR-88D tower engineering data and engineering change proposals resulting from any modifications to the documented tower configuration.  Although the Government does not require the use of OEM parts, offerors are required to declare in their proposal that either (1) they elect to use only OEM parts, or (2) they elect to use substitute equivalent parts.  Evaluation criteria are Technical Qualifications/Understanding (50%), Past Performance (30%), and Management Capabilities/Corporate Experience (20%).  All evaluation factors other than cost or price are significantly more important than cost or price.  The Government anticipates awarding a contract to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  This acquisition is expected to be awarded under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 811219 on the basis of full and open competition.  See Note 26.

FOB DEST FT MEADE MD 90 DAY DELY (INCL INSTALLATION AND ON SITE ORIENTATION) Flow injection analysis must be used for sample introduction/injection and chemistry determinations.  This will provide  for 5 minute startup, 15 minute chemistry changeovers and 5 minute shutdown.  The system should be capable of being upgraded to include suppressed ion chromatography (IC) and the IC system will shard peripherals such as the sampler and data system.  The IC system should be able to run independently  and simultaneously from the FIA portion of the system and using the same software program.  The system should be upgradable for up to 8 channels.  These channels cannot be stacked over other instrument parts reducing the risk of liquid contamination of electronics.  No glassware is to be used with  the chemistry manifolds. The instrument must be capable of running on an automated or manual mode.  Photometric detectors must operate from 340 to 880nm.  Sample rate of analysis should be up to 120 samples/ hour with baseline resolution within 1% of full scale over a dynamic range of two orders of  magnitude.    System must use an xyz sampler with random access sampling. Each autosampler shall have random access sampling capability with at least 360 capacity.   Automated recalibration of the instrument must be possible based on Quality Control input.  Data system must allow the  viewing/printing of the calibration curve during/previous to sample analysis.  All methods must include linearity, precision, accuracy and method detection limit data.  The data produced by the user must be provided in real-time; the analyte concentrations are provided as soon as the sample exits  the system detectors and within 30 to 60 seconds after injection.  The system should have a 1 year warranty on parts and labor with extended warranties available if requested.  Parts or components must be available for loan or purchase within 48 hours of request due to sample preservation times.   They must be available during and after the warranty period.  Internet access should also be available for technical support with software or data questions to be resolved.  The software system must have an automated diluter with the ability to rerun any off scale samples and prepare  working  standards for a stock standard.  This diluter will have four user selectable  dilution rates for off scale sample analysis allowing the system to detect off scale samples, dilute them to the correct ration and reanalyze them.  The dilutor will not be a single step diluter (ie 10:1) requiring  sequential step dilutions for off scale samples (ie above 10:1).  Dilution range should be from 2:1 to 1000:1.  The chemistry manifolds must not require compressed gas or debubbler/rebubblers.  All chemistry manifolds must use inert PTFE tubing or an equal.  All these components must be accessible  to the user from the top allowing the average user to easily service the manifold and replace tubing quickly without handling small glass components. Computer must be at least  a Pentium 200 Mhz with 1.6GB hard drive, 32 M SDRAM, 12X CD-ROM, 2 serial ports, 1 parallel port, bus mouse, Windows 2000  or XP, SVGA 17" monitor with HP Deskjet printer.  The FIA software must run under Windows 2000 or Windows XP and must preform simultaneous instrument control, data acquisition, and report generation.  The software must automatically estimate the concentrations of off-scale samples and schedule  these samples for dilution to bring their concentration within the range of the calibration.  The data processing software provides for the data quality management options that permit the operator to choose options for recalibrating the instrument, for setting QA/QC protocols to monitor the  accuracy and precision. The QC program in the software must include; QC limits for each QC check standard, both relative and absolute. User defined QC limits with out-of-range detection and immediate correction prior to any inaccurate data generation for any type of sample.  Automated QC/QA  protocol to monitor accuracy and precision.   A selection of types of QC samples, ie blanks, knowns, checks, duplicates, spikes and spiked duplicates for each sample and a automated protocol for Method Detection Limit determination.  The software should include data quality management, ie, should  any quality control sample fail to fall within specified limits set by the operator the software automatically instructs the instrument to perform one of five options ,1. Give message showing how far out of specification the QC is, but continue the run, 2.  Automatically recalibrate and rerun the  samples. 3. Automatically recalibrate and rerun all samples after the last quality control set that passed. 4. Abort the run. 5. Offer a menu with various choices from above.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), National Institutes of Health,  intends to negotiate with Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica located in Merelos, Mexico, to issue a modification to contract number N01-ES-15467 entitled "Effect of the Antiandrogen Measures at Birth" on a sole source basis. The purpose of the modification is to conduct a follow-up study to assess duration of breast feeding and other outcomes.  Specifically, the Contractor shall (1) hire and train a scientific team (study staff) that shall locate, enroll, and study women and their children in their homes, according to a prescribed study schedule. (2) enter into computer files data obtained by the questionnaire and antropometric measurement. (3) analyze a stored serum specimen from about 500 mothers for DDE and related compounds. (4) collaborate with NIEHS scientists in writing scientific reports on the project for publication in peer-reviewed journals. (5) move one aliquot of maternal serum for each subject to the NIEHS specimen repository for long-term storage.  It is the Government's estimate that this additional work will require an additional two years to perform. Authority: 41 USC 253(c)(1) FAR 66.302-1(b)(1) The current contractor is in a unique position to analyze blood specimens from all the women enrolled in the original study.  The effect of DDE on lactation can be done without having to obtain new biologic specimens from subjects.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government   makes competition unfeasible.   See Numbered Note: 22

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 333131   NAICS Code: 333131   This amendment # 2 to RFQ-OH-03-00181 is being issued to clarify the following questions, the answers immediately follow the question. System horsepower requirements to grind anthracite coal in the 100 hardgrove range will require medium horsepower  motor capacity. This size motor is only available in 480/3/60 electric service.Project requirements dictate that 480/3/60 volt    electric service be provided. Please confirm. Please advise if you require us to provide 480/3/60 volt power. If so, please advise if we can supply gas or diesel fired  generator and or distance from power company major power line and voltage of that service to system installation area.. Answer:  The EPA cannot specify what motor to use for the pulverizer system.  It is up to the proposer to determine the size and electrical requirements to fulfill the  requirements of the solicitation.  480/3/60 is NOT available at the site where the pulverizer will be installed.

PROCUREMENT PROCESS*****

The Company intends to award an evaluated competitive firm-fixed price subcontract to the qualified successful Small Business offeror that best meets the project’s goals and objectives.  Selection will be based on best-value using a three-phased approach Expression of Interest (EOI) Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and a Request for Proposals (RFP). 

Phase 1, Expression of Interest, will determine if a sufficient number of qualified small businesses are interested. If there is adequate interest in small business community to proceed to Phase 2, then the strategy remains a Small Business Set Aside. Should there be insufficient small businesses expressing interest to provide adequate competition in the bid process, then the bid strategy will revert to full and open competition and include qualified large and small businesses that expressed interest. 

Phase 2, Request for Qualifications, will request that firms respond to evaluation factors regarding Past Performance & Experience, Technical Capabilities, and Organization & Personnel Qualifications. The relative weights of the factors reflecting their project importance are assigned by the source selection team prior to issue of the RFQ. From the responses received, the Company will evaluate and score the Statements of Qualification against the RFQ evaluation criteria to down-select to the shortlist to receive the Request for Proposals. No pricing is to be included in Phase 2. 

Phase 3, Request for Proposals, will request that firms respond to technical evaluation factors such as, but not limited to, Project Management Plan & Business Management, Structure & Control, and Socioeconomic and Affirmative Action Plans and provide Pricing. A pre-bid meeting is planned in Oak Ridge, TN. The basis for award will be the firm offering the best overall value, considering price, the technical RFP submittals, and the SOQs evaluated under the Request for Qualification. Subcontract award is anticipated in April 2004, but will ultimately depend on the availability of funding.

The Company strongly encourages providing maximum opportunities for small business concerns as a critical and important element of the building 9720-82 construction project. In case of a full and open competition bid, Large Businesses are required to submit a Small Business subcontracting plan as part of their proposal. *****

<SUBJECT>A -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON  AN UPPER STAGE ENGINE TECHNOLOGY EFFORT
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  The Government does not intend to award a contract or any other type of agreement on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this synopsis.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation for bid.  The intent of this RFI is to obtain market research.  Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis.
The Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) program continues to be a vital Department of Defense / National Aeronautics and Space Administration (DoD/NASA) and industry effort.  IHPRPT was established to strengthen the technology base of the DoD and commercial rocket propulsion systems through the development of advanced, innovative rocket propulsion technology.
The Air Force and NASA are considering a new upper stage engine technology effort.  It will be managed jointly with an Air Force program manager and NASA deputy program manager.  The objective of this effort is to pursue the IHPRPT upper stage engine goals through improved computational design tools.  This will be achieved in a three part approach consisting of tool improvement/development, implementation, and validation.
The first part will be to improve/develop computational design tools as they relate to LOX/LH2 expander cycle upper stage engines.  The government anticipates these tools to correspond to the conceptual, preliminary, and critical design levels.  The conceptual design tools will include engine and component (turbopump and thrust chamber) tools.  The preliminary and critical design tools will include only turbopump and thrust chamber tools.  The government intends for these computational tools to be available to U.S. Government Agencies and their contractors.
The second part will be to implement engine and component designs using the updated tools.  As each set of tools is completed, the appropriate design work will be initiated (i.e. when the conceptual design tools are ready conceptual design will begin, etc?).  Thrust level will not be specified.  At the completion of this part there will be an upper stage engine conceptual design and turbopump and thrust chamber critical designs.  In order to focus on expanding the component technology, the cycle requirements defined in the conceptual engine design will not be strictly enforced during the component designs.  Risk reduction activities relating to the component development may be identified as options.
The third and final part will be to fabricate and test key components.  The government will choose which components will be tested.  These tests will primarily be used to validate the tools and secondarily to satisfy IHPRPT goals.  Testing will be provided by the government.
An RFI Supplemental Package containing a DRAFT schedule, DRAFT funding profile, and IHPRPT goals and baselines is available.  Only U.S. contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Federal Center, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (800-352-3572) that have a legitimate business purpose or who are teamed with one of the registered contractors will have access.  If you are registered with the DLSC, you must submit a copy of the approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the supplemental package.  To receive a copy of the RFI Supplemental Package contact 1Lt Daniel Wright (661-275-5583).
Please respond to the following questions as they relate to this plan.
1) 	Is the approach of integrated tool improvement and implementation sound?
2) 	Are there any additional tasks the government should consider?
3) 	If only one component is targeted for design and test which component should that be?
4) 	How much of the work can realistically be performed with the DRAFT funding profile shown in the RFI Supplemental Package?
5) 	If you disregarded the DRAFT funding profile, what would your Rough Order Magnitude fully burdened cost for this effort be?
6) 	Has adequate time been scheduled for each task?  If not, what is a more realistic schedule?
7) 	What is your current computational design tool capability?
8) 	What is your current upper stage LOX/LH2 expander cycle engine capability?
9) 	What contract type do you think is most appropriate and why?

THREE copies of each response must be submitted to 1Lt Daniel Wright, AFRL/PRSE, 4 Draco Drive, Edwards AFB, CA  93524.  Electronic responses are acceptable (email address daniel.wright@edwards.af.mil).  Any company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked.  Responses shall be limited to TWO pages per question and are due not later than 30 days from the publication of this notice.  Companies may contact 1Lt Wright for clarification.  The information provided through the responses will be used to aid in requirements definition for future acquisitions.
