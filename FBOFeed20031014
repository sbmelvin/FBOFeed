<DESC>NASA/SSC has a requirement for services to develop Decision Support Systems. NASA/SSC intends to purchase the services from International City/County Management Association of Washington, DC. A Recommendation and Determination to Solicit from One Source is included in the file. The NAICS Code and the size standard is 541618 and $5.0 million, respectively. The Statement of Work is as follows: 1.0	Background Unmanaged community growth, such as unrestrained development, urban sprawl, or insufficient transportation infrastructure, diminishes the livability of communities and is a detriment to the environment.  Unrestrained growth also impacts environmental regulation compliance. The concept of “smart growth” is based on planning policies that recognize the connection between development, the environment, and quality of life, and attempt to serve the mutual benefit of each and detriment to none.	 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) National Application Strategy serves to enhance decision support systems (DSSs) of national interest and utility with NASA Earth science measurements.  These measurements, comprising data from as many as 18 Earth-viewing satellites, may enhance the capacity for improvement in community growth DSSs. Therefore, NASA seeks to explore opportunities where Earth science measurements can enhance community growth DSSs and facilitate the implementation of smart growth principles.    2.0 Purpose The Contractor shall assist NASA in achieving the initial goals of the community growth national application. NASA’s efforts in the application area of community growth focus on the Gulf Coast states and the decision support tools currently implemented in that region. NASA will also require information pertaining to other community growth-related DSSs implemented nationally.  An increased understanding of community growth-related DSSs and the corresponding user requirements will allow NASA to identify strategic or unique opportunities for benchmarking the enhancement capacity of Earth science measurement data.  Community growth involves a number of crosscutting issues pertaining to community development practices and patterns. Stakeholders involved in community growth commonly refer to “smart growth” principles to evaluate and make decisions about development practices. As such, the community growth application area will also explore the potential contributions and impacts that Earth science measurement data may have on the implementation of smart growth principles in community growth-related DSSs. 3.0 Scope Tasks outlined by this SOW include all labor, material, equipment, and travel necessary to provide the tasks and deliverables identified below. 4.0	 Tasks Task 1	 Inventory and Profile Existing Community Growth-Related DSS Currently Implemented In The Gulf Coast States: As the National Application Strategy seeks to enhance decision support systems with data from Earth science measurements, NASA must understand the current state of the practice of community growth related DSSs in the Gulf Coast states. The Contractor will identify and profile the currently implemented DSSs in the Gulf Coast states.  The profiles shall focus on environmental issues and contain the following information: ownership of the DSS, years in operation, number, type, and geographic extent of users, etc. Task 2  Identify and Profile Existing Community Growth-Related DSS Currently Implemented Nationally: NASA also requires information on comparable DSSs implemented nationally. While NASA appreciates the complexity of this task and understands that a nationally comprehensive list is not possible, The Contractor shall identify those related DSSs.  The profiles shall focus on environmental issues and contain the following information: ownership of the DSS, years in operation, number, type, and geographic extent of users, etc. Task 3  Research NASA-funded projects relating to Community Growth: NASA funds a variety of research endeavors. While the NASA research may aim to improve conditions in one specific community or focus on one specific topic, it is likely that findings of the research have wider applicability. The Contractor will research the projects currently funded under the 12 National Application Areas and the State, Local, and Tribal Broad Agency Announcement – to identify some of the successes, contributions, findings, and lessons learned that would be relevant to share among practitioners in the fields of community growth. The Contractor will use the research to propose an approach and format for documenting these earth science results, as well as vehicles for disseminating the information among community growth practitioners.	Task 4	   Final Report and Presentation at Stennis Space Center with NASA Community Growth program management: Two The Contractor researchers will meet at the Stennis Space Center with Community Growth program management to discuss the findings of Tasks 1 – 3 and to deliver and present the final report.	5.0    Deliverables Deliverables for all Tasks shall be reports in MS/Word submitted on CDROM in digital form.  Task 4 includes travel to SSC and a presentation of the Final Report. 6.0	  Performance Standard Task 1	The report shall contain complete profiles of community growth-related DSSs currently implemented in the Gulf Coast states. Task 2	    The report shall contain complete profiles of community growth-related DSSs currently implemented nationally. Task 3	The report shall contain a strategy for documenting NASA-funded research efforts, benefits, and applications and relevance of research findings, as well as a plan for disseminating the documented information to practitioners and other stakeholders (e.g. federal, state, local, and tribal decision makers). Task 4        The report shall contain a summary of the research efforts under Tasks 1-3 and document the research findings. 7.0      Proposal Format The proposal shall provide a milestone payment schedule that is sufficient to recover all costs (i.e., labor, materials, travel, other direct costs, overhead, G&A, and incidentals) necessary to complete each task in the Statement of Work. This activity shall commence after successful contract negotiations and issuance of a firm-fixed price contract.  Notice to proceed shall be issued by the NASA SSC Procurement Office.   8.0	 Schedule The performance period of this SOW is from the date of the award and will continue for six (6) months after award date.  Deliverables shall be provided to the Contracting Officer in accordance with the following schedule.  The Contractor shall provide a delivery schedule for the tasks and deliverables identified above.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on October 30, 2003. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, VA will be hosting an Industry Day/Pre-solicitation conference on 7 November 2003 at the Hylton Memorial Chapel in Woodbridge, VA to provide an overview of the Marine Corps Global Combat Support System (GCSS-MC).

The Joint GCSS Mission Needs Statement (MNS), approved in September 1997, established the Marine Corps’ need for a modernized logistics information system.  Current Marine Corps logistics information systems have the following primary deficiencies:

·	They were designed to support specific functional processes, leading to non-interoperable “stovepiped” systems that are expensive to develop and require overhead to maintain interfaces and deliver functionality
·	They force users to learn the intricacies of the computer system versus the specifics of the combat service support process

The GCSS-MC Logistics Chain Management (GCSS-MC/LCM) program, which is Block 1 of the GCSS-MC portfolio modernization process, mitigates these deficiencies by mandating a Marine Corps-wide view of existing and future logistics information technology.  GCSS-MC/LCM requires that current and future systems operate together via the network and provide a shared data environment using Internet-based interfaces, standard data and transaction sets, and AIT devices.

Additionally, GCSS-MC/LCM introduces the replacement of five selected legacy systems that are scheduled for divestiture.  A Systems Realignment and Categorization (SRAC) for Marine Corps logistics systems was performed to determine disposition of legacy Automated Information Systems (AISs).  The recommendations provided have been approved and an initial migration approach has been developed.  This abbreviated migration is referred to as the “Lights Out” initiative, with specific implications for a carefully planned migration process directed by the Deputy Commandant for Logistics (DC, I&L).  The “Lights Out” initiative signals the onset of change management for the logistics domain, with revised policy and improved procedures provided to support COTS implementation throughout the Enterprise.  Most importantly, the availability of GCSS-MC/LCM confirms determination by the enterprise to significantly improve the future business model and deliver a more effective and contemporary degree of logistics support.  GCSS-MC/LCM is the gateway to more aggressive migration activities required in the out years, and becomes the hallmark event for the long anticipated divestiture from aging legacy systems.
GCSS-MC/LCM provides the information technology capabilities necessary to execute Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Combat Service Support (CSS) and Supporting Establishment (SE) functions in expeditionary, joint, and combined environments, and those Combatant Command logistical areas addressed in the GCSS Capstone Requirements Document (CRD).  The system will be developed using COTS business application suites or best-of-breed modules.

GCSS-MC/LCM is the first real, organized, major enterprise initiative using COTS products to support expeditionary logistics.  The completion of the GCSS-MC/LCM implementation will impact the entire Marine Corps, and will rely on a logistics network based on a tactical communications backbone for managing critical information.
An Operational Architecture (OA) has been developed to improve outdated United States Marine Corps (USMC) logistics processes and systems by fusing supply chain management principles, best practices, and war fighting capabilities.  The objective of the OA is to develop a set of integrated (horizontal) business processes that will enable a single logistics enterprise model.  The OA consists of a series of artifacts that describe the tasks, activities, and information exchange requirements necessary to conduct Marine Corps logistics in an expeditionary environment.  Building on the Supply Chain Operational Reference (SCOR) Model, the OA defines new logistics roles and functions, and establishes a "logistics chain management" framework. 

Attendance to this Industry Day/Pre-solicitation conference is recommended for all vendors interested in GCSS-MC, both Software vendors and System Integrator Vendors.  It is anticipated that a draft RFP for the COTS Selection will be released on or about 31 October 2003.  Release will be via the GCSS-MC web site at: www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/ITM2K/projects/GCSS-MC/GCSS-Main.asp only.  Hard copies will not be distributed.  Communications related to this program will be via the Contracting Officer at berrydw@mcsc.usmc.mil only.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS HEREBY BEING ISSUED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS, INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. This procurement is for the award of a Design Build contract. The Two-Phase, Design-Build Request for Proposal procedures will be utilized for this procurement. It consists of the design and construction of a RECRUIT TRAINING FACILITY ADDITION, MARINE CORPS RECRUIT DEPOT, PARRIS ISLAND, SC. DESCRIPTION: This new structure will be an addition to the Recruit Training Facility. The concrete masonry addition will be a high single story building with a sloped classroom floor, fixed seating, acoustically treated wall panels and ceilings, raised stage with projection screen, brick facing and standing seam metal roof. The addition will provide fixed seating for 600 recruits. Special construction features include high ceiling, high building construction, acoustical treatment, folding partition walls, projection screen, projection room, and public address system. Paving and site improvements include lighted and paved parking, exterior corridors and sidewalks. The estimated cost for design and construction of the project is between $2,970,000 and $3,300,000. Proposals will be evaluated using two-phase source selection procedures that will result in award of a firm-fixed price design/build contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to approximately five (5) offerors (design-build firms or teams) based on design-build factors that include: FACTOR A-Past Performance, 1-Design Team, and 2-Construction Team; FACTOR B-Small Business Effort (Phase I); FACTOR C-Technical Qualifications, 1-Design Team and 2-Construction Team; and FACTOR D-Management Approach. There are no Plans and Specifications in Phase I. A maximum of five (5) firms will be selected to submit Technical and Price Proposals for Phase II and an amendment will be issued to those firms only.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II. In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit technical and price proposals for the project. Price proposals will include total evaluated price, such as, base proposal, options, and evaluation of scope/design options within the Governments published budget for award. The Government reserves the right to: reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; negotiate with any or all offerors; award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated; and award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND SELECT PHASE II OFFERORS WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms. Proposers should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. FIRMS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED FOR SPECIFICATIONS OR DOCUMENTATION. The Government intends to issue the Phase I Request for Proposals (RFP) electronically by posting it on the NAVFAC website, http://esol.navfac.navy.mil., on 29 October 2003. Phase I proposals will be due on 02 December 2003.  Offerors must register themselves on the Internet at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  The Phase II RFP, including the plans and specs, will be posted at a later date on the NAVFAC web site for viewing and downloading, although the download time may be excessive.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has a requirement to solicits proposals for the development, characterization and validation of in vitro assays and in vivo animal models to assess the safety of cell substrates and vaccine components that are being considered for use in vaccine manufacturing.  The need for contemporary in vitro assays and in vivo animal models has arisen from 1) the development of vaccine candidates that can only be grown in cell substrates and/or require use of excipients or adjuvants that have not previously been used to manufacture licensed vaccines, and 2) previously unrecognized theoretical safety questions.  For example, few tests are available to specifically assess certain safety issues that are unique to new cell substrates.  These issues include tumorgenicity of the whole cell substrate, oncogenicity of the cellular DNA, and the detection of latent/occult adventitious agents in the cell substrate.  Experimental data are needed regarding these issues in order for manufacturers and regulatory agencies to meaningfully assess and analyze the safety of vaccines manufactured in these new cell substrates.  The focus of this RFP is to develop both in vitro assays and in vivo animal models to assess current and future safety concerns that arise regarding vaccines and vaccine manufacturing and/or formulation, including 1) assessing the tumorgenic potential of cell substrates; 2) assessing the oncogenic potential of cell substrate DNA; and 3) screening for latent/occult adventitious agents in cell substrates.              

This acquisition comprises five separate parts, each focusing on a specific area of in vitro assay development or in vivo animal model development:  Part A:  Develop, characterize and validate in vivo animal model(s) to assess tumorgenic potential of cell substrates.  Animal models will be developed to assess the tumorgenic potential of live cells themselves.   Part B:  Develop, characterize and validate in vitro assays to assess and characterize tumorgenic potential of cell substrates.  In vitro assays will be developed to assess the tumorgenic potential of live cells themselves.  In vitro assays will also be developed to identify markers of cellular immortalization/transformation.   Part C:  Develop, characterize and validate in vivo animal models to analyze the oncogenic potential of cellular DNA.  Animal models will be developed to assess the risk of cell substrate DNA itself having oncogenic potential.  Part D:  Develop, characterize and validate in vitro assays to analyze the oncogenic potential of cellular DNA.  In vitro assays will be developed to assess the risk of cell substrate DNA itself having oncogenic potential.  
Part E:  Develop, characterize and validate assays for detection of novel or latent/occult adventitious agents in cell substrates.  Assays will be developed to screen for infectious agents that are not detected by currently used adventitious agent tests.  This will include development of assays to assess the potential for cell substrates to harbor and transmit TSEs.

Additionally, Offerors may propose a single in vivo animal model, multiple in vivo animal models, a single in vitro assay or multiple in vitro assays for each Part of this solicitation.  However, each proposed animal model and/or assay must be tested using two cell substrates.

The development process for both in vitro assays and in vivo animal models will consist of two stages.  The first stage will be to determine the general feasibility, utility and sensitivity of the in vitro assay and in vivo animal model.  Upon completion of the first stage, the results will be analyzed, and those in vitro assays and in vivo animal models deemed promising by the government will be selected for validation – the second stage of development.  Validation will be conducted in accordance with the most current U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines.  Links to the most current information concerning validation can be found on the FDA website http://www.fda.gov/, and the ICH website http://www.ich.org/ich5.html.

To the extent possible, efforts should focus on applying existing technologies, reagents, techniques, and animal strains to animal model development.  For example, proposals to develop assays for in vitro analysis of the oncogenic potential of live cells could include a more thorough development and validation effort of the currently used growth in soft agar assay.  

The use of currently available animal strains, rather than the development of new animal strains (i.e., new knockout mice) is strongly encouraged.  Furthermore, it is expected that the animals used in model development will be rodent models, such as mouse, rat or hamster.  However, proposals to use other types of animals, either rodent of non-rodent, will be acceptable and considered.

Offerors may respond to any or all of Parts A, B, C, D, and E; however, a separate technical and business proposal must be submitted for each Part.   Tasks encompassed under Parts B and D, including validation, must be completed within thirty-six (36) months from the date of award.  Tasks encompassed under Parts A, C, and E, including validation, must be completed within sixty (60) months from the date of award.  

This acquisition has total available funding in the amount $3,000,000 per year for all contracts awarded under this solicitation.  It is anticipated that two to five (2-5) cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts  will be awarded for a three to five (3-5) year period, beginning on or about September 30, 2004.  RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-04-22 will be available electronically on or about October 20, 2003, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home page by using the following electronic address and instructions:

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   Mobile Air Conditioner R152a and Second-Generation R744 System Component Assessment Period of Performance >From Purchase Order Award through August 31, 2004.   Background Mobile Air Conditioners (MACs) contribute substantially to global warming.  Greenhouse gas  emissions come from direct emissions of the refrigerant used and indirect CO2 emissions from the combustion of fuel to power the air conditioner.  HFC-134a (R134a), the predominate refrigerant in automotive air conditioners since the phase-out of CFCs, is a potent greenhouse gas.  The MAC industry  and environmental agencies around the world are working to reduce both direct and indirect emissions from MACS.  This collaborative effort is a major focus of the EPA's Mobile Air Conditioning Climate Protection Partnership (MACCPP).  Alternative refrigerants CO2 (R744) and HFC-152a (R152a) are  being considered by vehicle manufacturers and their air conditioning suppliers as a way to achieve corporate and partnership goals.  These refrigerants not only have much lower global warming potentials, but they have the potential to achieve higher energy efficiency automotive air conditioning  systems. There is a discrepancy between the theoretical potential of alternative refrigerant MACs and their actual performance in operation.  Therefore, alternative refrigerant air conditioning systems need to be analyzed so that they can be improved and compared with other systems.  Until now,  considerable testing has only been done on HFC-134a, first generation Carbon Dioxide and Propane systems.  However, it is now clear that a test program needs to be in place which focuses on the R152a system and "second generation" R744 systems.  The tests will evaluate and assess the potential  contribution of refrigerant and components to overall system cooling capacity and efficiency performance.   Purpose and Objectives Under this Purchase Order the Contractor shall test R152a and R744 air conditioner systems according to the test procedures established by the SAE  Alternate  Refrigerant Cooperative Research Program (SAE ARCRP).   Task Description and Deliverables The Contractor shall conduct a series of tests of AC system and refrigerants with the following components: two (2) compressors with at least one having an integrated oil separator, two (2) evaporators, two  (2) condensers, one (1)  internal heat exchanger, one (1) oil separator.    For each system using a specified component, the Contractor shall coordinate the testing on standardized testing equipment.  In addition, the Contractor shall analyze and report electronically to EPA's MACCPP. The  Contractor shall produce a single comprehensive report detailing the SAE ARCRP testing procedures after systems, with all the components, have been tested. The Contractor shall deliver a copy of the final financial and procedural issues report to the EPA Project Officer upon completion of the  project. Format of Written Deliverables The Contractor shall submit all reports and documents in electronic format to the EPA Project Officer.  All reports/documents submitted must be in hard copy and in 3.5" disk.  Direct transfer of files by e-mail is also acceptable.  The document program  used to create these reports must be Corel WordPerfect 8.  Adobe Acrobat PDF files are also acceptable and preferable to WordPerfect files if the report or document is in final form for dissemination/distribution.  Database files should be maintained in MS Access 2000.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract for Systems Engineering, Management and Integration (SEMI) support for the PMA-280 Tomahawk Systems Engineering Organization (SEO).   This effort will include support for the baseline Tomahawk Weapons System (TWS), Tactical Tomahawk and other planned TWS improvements.  This contract will provide program management and systems engineering services needed by the Tomahawk SEO to support all TWS segments.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Company, Missile Systems Business Unit (RMS), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Since 1994, RMS has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR) and also RMS has been the sole contractor supporting the Tomahawk SEO exclusively for the resolution of Tomahawk system wide engineering issues.  Raytheon currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapon System.  They possess the required knowledge and documentation necessary to integrate new technologies into the AUR, and to assess their impacts to the entire TWS.  Because detailed knowledge of, and experience with, all segments of the Tomahawk Weapon System is required to conduct tasking under this contract, RMS is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.  The estimated period of performance is from October 2003 through September 2004 with a potential for a one-year extension.

The Contractor(s) proposals and plans may become a part of the contract upon the decision to award.  Past Performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  No Offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.

Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:
Installation:  Pittsburgh ARS
Location: Pittsburgh, PA
Installation Description:  The 911th Air Wing (AW) is located in the western portion of Allegheny County, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, within the Pittsburgh International Airport (IAP).  The Base is approximately 16 miles northwest of downtown Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania.  The 911th AW encompasses approximately 115 acres (12 owned and 103 acres leased) in the eastern portion of the Pittsburgh IAP.  The 911th AW has a total of 56 buildings.
Utility systems to be privatized: 
a.	Electric:
      Exelon Energy and Duquesne Light supply the electrical power to the Pittsburgh ARS, Pittsburgh IAP, through two primary distribution lines owned and maintained by Duquesne Light Company.  Exelon Energy supplies 68 percent of the electricity while Duquesne Light supplies 32 percent of the required electrical power.  The primary source originates at Duquesne’s Mountour substation approximately four miles ease of the Base and delivers 17,055 kilovolt-amperes (kVA) via 22.9 kilovolt (KV) overhead transmission lines.  The primary is stepped down at the Base substation to 4.16 kV to feed the Base primary.  An alternate source begins at the Russell Burdsall and Ward substation located three miles north of the Base, and delivers 10,313 kVA through 22.9kV overhead transmission lines.  Duquesne Light’s lines terminate at the base substation (Facility 212).  Automatic sectionalizing switches control the two circuits, providing automatic switching capability in the event of a power outage.  A three-phase 1500kV transformer owned by the power company steps down the voltage to 4160Volt (V) primary distribution for the Base.  Government ownership starts at the substation demand-side (secondary) with two 1200 Amp vacuum switches protecting two 4160V feeders.  From the substation, a combination overhead/underground system serves the majority of the base facilities.  The Base has a total of 55 buildings.  Base drawings show approximately 8,888 LF overhead cables and 15,555 LF of underground cables.  All of the PCB-contaminated electrical equipment has been replaced.  The system also includes the following:  (1)  59 transformers ranging from 10 kVA to 750 kVA; (2) 91 utility poles of various heights; (3) 14 switches (2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-way); and (4) 20 buildings have electric meters installed.  There is no Supervisory Council and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for remote operation or monitoring of the electrical system.  However, the Base has programmed a Demand Side Energy Reduction initiative that will provide load shedding of building air conditioning systems when a preset demand level is reached. The substation was constructed in the mid-1950’s.  The underground circuits are newer, with construction dates ranging from the mid-1960’s to present.  Equipment such as transformers average in age from 25 years for pole-mounted and 5 years for those on pads.  The underground cables are relatively new being installed in the 1990’s; a portion of the overhead (400 area) is part of the original 1940’s installation.  The existing Duquesne-owned substation is operating at its maximum capacity, and the base-owned switchgear is weak, requiring the base to restore power incrementally after outages.  The distribution system is generally in fair condition, and the positioning of switches throughout the system provides a degree of backup from one circuit to another.  A number of utility poles require replacement, as do some of the strain reliefs.  The Base has total of 58 facilities of which 16 are metered.

b.	Natural Gas:
      Peoples Natural Gas Company supplies natural gas to the 911th AW.  Gas is brought to the Base through a 6-inch coated and wrapped steel feeder pipe operating at 40 psi.  The 6-inch supply line enters the Base southeast of the main gate and runs parallel along Defense Avenue to the metering station located at Building 119.  At the metering station, pressure is reduced to 10 psi, and then distributed to Base facilities through piping ranging from 0.5 to 4-inches.  Thirty-six buildings have gas meters installed.  The existing 18,150 LF of pipe is polyethylene, which has been inserted in the original steel lines.  The polyethylene pipe has a tracer wire to facilitate locating this pipe.  The metering station is the only entry point for natural gas, and other than the building regulators, this is the only point where pressure is reduced.  Peoples Natural Gas owns all natural gas lines and the meter and regulator system to the point of pressure reduction; 911th AW assumes ownership of the gas lines on the “low-side” of the reducing station.  Plastic isolation valves located at each building and throughout the system enable portions to be isolated for maintenance.  The system was extensively replaced in FY 1991.  No code violations were observed during the site visit, and the system is in very good condition.

c.	Water Distribution System:
     Potable water is supplied to the 911th AW from the Moon Township Municipal Authority (MTMA) via a 12-inch main.  The water is metered and then delivered into the distribution system through the base’s 8-insh main.  The average pressure supplied to the Base is 90 psi.  The 911th AW provides no additional treatment, and the Base has no active potable water wells.  Water storage is provided by a 1.5-million gallon elevated water storage tank, which is located on-base but owned and operated by the MTMA.  The elevated storage tank is supplied through a 16-inch main, which is also owned by MTMA.  The elevated storage tank serves both the local community and the installation, and the MTMA reserves 300,000 gallons of water exclusively for the base’s fire protection requirements.  An additional ground-level tank stores 165,000 gallons of water used only for fire protection of two flightline facilities.  The Base water distribution system is government-owned and consists of approximately 26,000 linear feet of water mains and service laterals.  The majority of the mains were upgraded in 1991 with polyvinyl chloride (PVC); the remaining original system is ductile iron.  Most of the base’s original system was abandoned in place during the upgrade.  Most of the 911th AW water lines distribution water through a looped system; however, the system has some dead-end lines.  The water distribution system is generally in excellent condition.  Flow volume is good, and system pressures are well balanced.  Pressures at the fire hydrants are consistently in the 90-100 psi range with good flow.  Vales, which are generally older than the distribution lines, are all accessible and in good operating condition.  There are no known code violations.  There are 58 facilities on the Base of which only 6 are metered.  

d.	Wastewater Collection System:
     Wastewater generated by 911th AW is carried off base through a 15-inch sewer main in the southeast corner of the base, and disposed of through Moon Township Municipal Authority (MTMA) sanitary sewer lines and sewage treatment facility.  Sewage is not metered prior to entering the MTMA sanitary sewer system; instead the Base is billed for sewage treatment fees based upon 100 per cent of its potable water consumption.  Industrial wastes are treated through oil/water separators, which subsequently discharge directly to the sanitary sewer system.  The Base system meets all known regulatory requirements, and the discharge is compatible with MTMA’s requirements.  The 911th AW wastewater collection system consists of 19,640 feet of gravity-flow vitrified clay pipe.  The collection system includes laterals, oil/water separators, underground holding tanks, and collector mains.  The Base has no lift stations and the oil/water separators are not part of this contract.  Service laterals are typically 4- to 6-inches in diameter; mains range from 6- to 8-inches.  The wastewater collection system is generally in fair condition.  Most of the system is original and has not been lined, but the base’s terrain and slopes provide for adequate flow, and base personnel report no problems with blockages or backups.

Installation:  Pittsburgh Air National Guard Base
Location:  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Installation Description:  The 171st Air Refueling Wing (ARW) installation is located at the Pittsburgh International Airport (IAP) approximately 16 miles northwest of downtown Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania.  The 171st ARW occupies 179 acres and contains approximately 51 buildings and structures.  This land is leased from the Allegheny County Department of Aviation.

Utility systems to be privatized:

a.	Electrical:
     CMS Marketing Service and Trading provides the electrical commodity to the 171st ARW through two lines owned and maintained by Duquesne Light Company.  Duquesne’s lines terminate at the base substation (Facility 101).  A three-phase, 1500 kilovolt-ampere (kVA) transformer owned by the power company steps down the voltage to 4160 Volts (V) primary distribution for the base.  Electrical power for the entire base is metered at the substation.  Government ownership starts at the substation demand-side (secondary) with the switchgear.  From the substation, the system feeds the base with two separate circuits, one supplying the area west of the airfield, and the other supplying areas south and east of the airfield.  Base drawings show approximately 13,130 LF of underground secondary conductors, 4,530 LF of primary underground conductors, approximately 3,840 LF of overhead secondary conductors, and 5,740 LF of primary overhead cables.  The system also includes the following:  (1) 55 transformers ranging from 10kVA to 500 kVA; (2) 67 utility poles of various heights; (3) 22 airfield light stanchions; and (4) 3 double throw vacuum switches.  There is no Supervisory Council and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for remote operation or monitoring of the electrical system.  However, Duquesne has the capability to remotely read the electric meter at the substation through a modem.  In addition, there are on 3 facilities of 44 that have meters.  The existing system is primarily underground, with above ground lines in a few areas.  The system varies in age from 7 to 50 years.  The underground cable was installed in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) conduit with concrete casings in 1992.  Most of the overhead cable is original, installed in the early 1950’s.  Transformers and associated equipment range in age from approximately 25 years for pole mounted and approximately 5 years for those on pads.  All of the underground cables and ducts, and most of the overhead cables are in good condition.  Transformers are generally in good condition, and all of the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated electrical equipment has been replaced.  Manholes and power poles are in good condition, although the manholes are considered confined spaces for maintenance entry and two poles have minor problems with structural loads.  The base has systematic problems with 3-phase equipment motors (such as for air conditioning compressors) burning up due to single phasing characteristics when power is intermittently lost or when restoring base power after outages.  The base is studying the installation of a 3-phase loss relay system to rectify the problem.  There are no known code violations or discrepancies.  Lli Technologies and Sergeant Electric maintain the 171st ARW electrical utilities through service contracts.  
 
b.	Natural Gas Distribution System:
CMS Marketing Services and Trading supplies natural gas to the 171st ARW through a 6-inch coated and wrapped steel feeder pipe owned by the Peoples Natural Gas Company.  Pressure is reduced from 40 psi to 10 psi at the metering station on Cliff Mine Road and then distributed to base facilities through piping ranging from 0.5 to 4 inches.  Pipe material is a combination of black iron and polyethylene.  The Cliff Mine Road metering station is the only entry point for natural gas, and other than the building regulators, this is the only regulators with shut-off valves.  Peoples owns all natural gas lines, meters, and regulators to the point of pressure reduction; the 171st ARW assumes ownership of the gas lines o the “low-side” of the reducing station.  Base drawings show approximately 9,400 LF of gas mains on-base.  Approximately 1,610 LF of steel piping was replaced in 1990 and the remaining 7,800 LF was installed in 1955.  There are no valves on the distribution system, other than those at the buildings.  The portions of the system with black iron pipe are approximately 45 years old; the polyethylene pipe is less than 10 years old.  The 171st ARW has no personnel or equipment on-base to repair breaks or leaks in the polyethylene pipe, and therefore maintains the natural gas system by service contract on an as required basis.

c.	Water Distribution System:
     Water is supplied to the 171st ARW from the Moon Township Municipal Authority (MTMA) via a 10-inch ductile iron main that runs beneath the runway 32-14 and the approaches to runways 28L and 28C.  The base does not own or maintain this 10-inch water line.  The base owns the supply line an distribution mains.  A single meter located near the base of the elevated water storage tank located at the 911th AW meters the main feed from MTMA.  MTMA owns and reads this meter.  Findlay Township provides a backup water source, which enters the base at the main gate and is metered in a pit near the main gate just inside the installation property.  Findlay owns and reads this meter.  After metering, the water enters the base distribution system, which is a combination of several loops, and a number of long dead-end branches.  There are no water meters installed at the facilities.  The average pressure supplies to the base is 90 psi.  The base has a 150,000 gallon storage tank which is used for fire protection only.  The 171st ARW provides not additional water treatment and the base has no active potable wells.  Including the supply lines to the base, water mains are comprised of approximately 19,419 LF of pipe, most of which is 8-inch asbestos cement that is nearly 50 years old.  The system’s dead ends do not appear to create any maintenance problems; the system balance is good, the dead ends all provide a mean for flushing, and the base reports no sediment or brown water problems.  The system’s age, however, presents several serious problems.  System repairs are difficult because of the high percentage of mains located under the airfield-parking ramp and other pavements, and the proximity of the mains to buildings and other obstacles.  The supply line running under the ramp breaks, on average, once a winter.  The system’s 55 valves are properly located for isolation purposes, but maintenance personnel estimate that only 15 of them work properly.  There are 28 fire hydrants and associated 4.5-inch valves located on base.  Hydrant-testing results reveal insufficient flow for adequate fire protection.  Since the main pipes appear to be adequately sized to meet the base’s requirements, this is likely due to the constricting effects of mineral deposits on interior pipe walls.  This assessment is based on the number of water line breaks to the system and the condition of the piping replaced or repaired.  There are no known code violations.  The foregoing problems could be corrected by replacing the base’s 6- and 8-inch mains with new 8-inch mains and changing the supply source to eliminate the main running under the ramp area.  The base has already identified two alternative recommendations to the current supply sources.  These alternatives recommend switching to Findley as the primary source (assuming they have adequate capacity) and extending a main east of the base to connect to MTMA’s distribution system near Beaver Grade Road.  This assessment was made during 1999, therefore, some of these problems may have been rectified.  The base has facility backflow preventer units installed, however, these backflow units are not part of this contract.  There are no large backflow preventers on the distribution system.  The 171st ARW maintains the water distribution system by service contract with local plumbing contractor(s).

d.	Wastewater Collection System:  
     Wastewater generated by the 171st ARW flows off-base through a 8-inch sewer main in the southeast corner of the base, discharged into Moon Township Municipal Authority’s (MTMA) 18-inch sanitary sewer line and treated at MTMA’s sewage treatment facility.  Base ownership ends at MTMA’s 18-inch line.  Sewage is not metered prior to entering the MTMA sanitary sewer system; instead the base is billed for sewage treatment fees based on 100 percent of its potable water consumption.  Industrial wastes are treated through oil/water separators, which subsequently discharge directly to the sanitary sewer system.  The oil/water separators are not part of this contract.  The base system meets all known regulatory requirements and the discharge is compatible with MTMA’s requirements.  The 171st ARW wastewater collection system consists of primarily 7,626 feet of gravity-flow pipe.  The collection system include laterals, oil/water separators, underground holding tanks, and collector mains.  The base has one lift station with an ejector pump, which serves only Building 316.  It is new as a result of that new construction.  The lift station is only operated when there is a UTA weekend and occasionally thereafter during the year.  Service laterals are typically 3- to 6-inches in diameter, and mains range from 6- to 8-inches.  Most of the system consists of original vitrified clay pipe installed in the 1950’s.  The 171st ARW has 31 manholes.  Many of these manholes require maintenance as result of age.  The major problems are wall repairs, ring repairs, and re-grouting.  Three manholes require rising, 1 requires lowering to facilitate waste flow, and the other 27 require maintenance and repair as specified above.  The 171st ARW maintains the wastewater collection system by service contract with local plumbing contractor(s).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA To accomplish the BCBL-H s mission requires development of a unique government contractor team able to collaborate in concert with the Army s vision.  The Army has structured a multi-phased program with the plan to use the Other Transaction for Prototype a uthority under Section 845 National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 as amended for the Concept and Technology Development (CTD) portion of the development.  Upon successful completion and at the Governments discretion the results may transit ion to Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier for System Development and Demonstration (SDD) and ultimately fielding of the mature demonstrated technologies.  The BCBL-H plans to leverage to the maximum extent Army Science and Technology (S&T) work commerc ial technical developments DARPA activities as well as those of other Federal DOD and Army agencies.  The BCBL-H/Offerors team will not exclude any promising less mature technologies that are on a parallel development path but beyond the timeframe of the p roduction programs program currently underway which could later be inserted during the course of BCBL-H technology development activities.  This effort is wide reaching in scope requiring vision, innovation and capability in multiple disciplines involving force unit  system(s) and technology development to maximize the effectiveness of future soldiers while potentially optimizing total ownership cost. The Government expects to establish multiple BPAs with Successful Offerors under this RFP. These efforts will be for f ive (5) years.

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS, AND IS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6 - STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS - AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICTATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.  The solicitation number is EC3000-204-01 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.  The associated North American Industrial Classification system (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 517410 with a small business size standard of $12.5 million. This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible parties may submit a quote. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) manages the Nation's operational geostationary and polar-orbiting environmental satellites, and manages a large collection of atmospheric, geophysical and oceanographic data. Within NESDIS, the Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPD) manages and directs the operation of the central ground facilities which ingest, process, and distribute environmental satellite data and derived products to domestic and foreign users.  The Direct Services Division of the OSDPD manages and operates the Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT) program.  The SARSAT program and system are part of the international Cospas-Sarsat System which is an international system designed to provide distress alert and location data to assist search and rescue (SAR) operations, using spacecraft and ground facilities to detect and locate the signals of distress beacons operating on 406 Megahertz (MHz) or 121.5 MHz.   The position of the distress and other related information is forwarded by the responsible Cospas-Sarsat Mission Control Center (MCC) to the appropriate SAR authorities. Currently, the Cospas-Sarsat system consists of an MCC in Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Taipei, United Kingdom, and the United States.  MCCs are being planned in Greece, Nigeria, Thailand, and Vietnam.  Further information concerning Cospas-Sarsat can be found at http://www.cospas_sarsat.org/  and http://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/ . The United States Mission Control Center (USMCC) is located in Suitland, MD.    The current primary means for the exchange of non-alert and alert information between the USMCC and other MCCs is X.25 via Packet Switched Data Networks (PSDNs) and an X.75 international gateway provided by MCI.   It should be noted that the data volume among MCCs is low and 56 kbps links are more than sufficient. NOAA/NESDIS has a requirement for access to an alternative X.75 gateway under the bidder's control, preferably in the United States, or in another country if a domestic gateway is unavailable, that can be accessed to allow the USMCC to continue X.25 data communications until at least 2010. The current figures and percentages are:  (a) OUTGOING TRAFFIC:  356 messages per day, averaging 200k bytes in a range of 150k to 250k bytes and where X.25 represents 42% of the total; and (b) INCOMING TRAFFIC: 231 messages per day, averaging 123k bytes in a range of 73k to 173k bytes and where X.25 represents 80% of the total. All X.25 connections originate and terminate at a Government X.25 switch. The contractor is required to provide the services and capabilities such that the USMCC can send/receive messages internationally by X.25. International Alphabet 5 used for messages to and from the USMCC is a hard requirement. The format and content of all the international messages sent and received by the USMCC are defined in "COSPAS/SARSAT Mission Control Centres Standard Interface Description", C/S A.002.  The Government requires the following Specific Capabilities and Characteristics. The contractor will provide international communication services as follows:  (a) provide a dedicated X.25 line to Suitland, MD to allow for simultaneous transmitting and receiving over a minimum of 64 virtual circuits; (b) provide circuit status confirmation;  (c) allow for addition/removal/ modification of communication sites and or services  without any changes or modifications to the contract; (d) at a minimum, handle transmission speeds between the USMCC and the vendors facility at 9.6kbps on an RS-232C physical interface.  The USMCC can also accept speeds ranging from 9.6kbps through 64kbps on a V.35 or RS-232C physical interface;  (e) the X.25 protocol must support the CCITT 1980, 1984 and 1988 standards;    (f) allow for an individual message size of up to 25,000 characters and ensure that message contents shall not be altered; (g) provide for a backup access to the vendor's network in the event of a failure of the dedicated line; and, (h) all of the above is to be duplicated at our Lanham, MD site except for the backup access sited in item (g). Outages will be subject to a recovery formula as mutually agreed upon after contract award. The Conditions of Services are as follows: (a) Communication Availability and Performance: Communications service shall be provided 24 hours per day on a continuous basis. The service must have an error transmission rate of one in ten million or less. The service shall have an operational availability of 99.5 % or greater calculated for each calendar day.  The reliability, maintainability and availability parameters defined in this specification do not include any impact due to Government equipment outages. All preventive maintenance should be transparent to the Government.  Any interruption in service will be treated as an outage subject to an outage recovery formula as mutually agreed upon after contract award. (b) Globally accessible: The communications service shall be globally accessible allowing NOAA to easily add communication sites (e.g., Vietnam, Greece, and Nigeria are expected to be added next year.)  The service shall also allow NOAA to easily remove or modify communication sites without notice to the vendor on the presumption that the vendor has a communications agreement in place with the nation accommodating that site.

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS, AND IS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6 - STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS - AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICTATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.  The solicitation number is EC3000-204-02 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.  The associated North American Industrial Classification system (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 517410 with a small business size standard of $12.5 million. This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible parties may submit a quote. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) manages the Nation's operational geostationary and polar-orbiting environmental satellites, and manages a large collection of atmospheric, geophysical and oceanographic data. Within NESDIS, the Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPD) manages and directs the operation of the central ground facilities which ingest, process, and distribute environmental satellite data and derived products to domestic and foreign users.  The Direct Services Division (DSD) of the OSDPD manages and operates the Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT) program.  The SARSAT program and system are part of the international Cospas-Sarsat System which is an international system designed to provide distress alert and location data to assist search and rescue (SAR) operations, using spacecraft and ground facilities to detect and locate the signals of distress beacons operating on 406 Megahertz (MHz) or 121.5 MHz.   The position of the distress and other related information is forwarded by the responsible Cospas-Sarsat Mission Control Center (MCC) to the appropriate SAR authorities. Currently, the Cospas-Sarsat system consists of an MCC in Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Taipei, United Kingdom, and the United States.   MCCs are being planned in Greece, Nigeria, Thailand, and Vietnam. Telex and fax messages are sent from the U.S. Mission Control Center (USMCC) to various international SAR Points Of Contact (SPOCs) and U.S. Rescue Coordination Centers (RCCs).  The USMCC is located in Suitland, MD. Further information concerning Cospas-Sarsat can be found at http://www.cospas_sarsat.org/   and http://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/.    NOAA/NESDIS has a requirement for the acquisition of messaging services that provide the USMCC capabilities to send facsimile message and send and receive telex messages.   These services are anticipated to allow the USMCC to continue national and international fax and telex data communications at least until 2010. It should be noted that the data volume among MCCs and the RCCs is low and a data rate of not less than 9.6 kbps nor more than 56 kbps are adequate for the mission. The current average byte volume per fax and telex is as follows: we send about 3500 faxes per month [117 per day]; we send about 160 Telex messages per month [5 per day]; and, we receive about 50 telex messages per month [2 per day]. Sample telex and fax messages appear in Appendix 1. Countries requiring telex and fax are shown in Appendix 2.  The USMCC requires near real-time automatic delivery i.e. a delivery time not to exceed 15 minutes from the beginning of a transmission to its receipt. The contractor is required to provide the services and capabilities such that the USMCC can send/receive telex messages, and send fax messages over a X.25 connection or other vendor provided transport or the Internet between the USMCC and the contractor's network. The International Alphabet 5 used for messages to and from the USMCC is a hard requirement. The format and content of all the international messages sent and received by the USMCC are defined in "COSPAS/SARSAT Mission Control Centres Standard Interface Description", C/S A.002.  The Government requires the following Specific Capabilities and Characteristics. The contractor will provide  communication services as follows: (a) provide circuit status confirmation; (b) allow for addition/removal/ modification of communication sites and or services (telex, or fax) without any changes or modifications to the contract; (c) telex service must have connection to international telex and be  as close to universal as possible; (d) at a minimum, handle transmission speeds between the USMCC and the vendors facility at 9.6kbps;  messages designated for fax or telex delivery must be delivered in near real-time, which for the purposes of this contract, is defined as no longer than 15 minutes from the start of transmission to start of receipt of message at destination; (e) provide a timely method of receipt verification (not to exceed 15 minutes); (f) the X.25 protocol, if used, must support the CCITT 1980, 1984 and 1988 standards; (g) provide a timely method of delivery failure notification to the USMCC (not to exceed 15 minutes); (h) allow for an individual message size of up to 25,000 characters and ensure that message contents shall not be altered; (i) handle text format using International Alphabet #5 (IA5) representation; and (j)  all of the above is to be duplicated at our Lanham, MD site. Outages will be subject to a recovery formula as mutually agreed upon after contract award. The Conditions of Services are as follows: (a) Communication Availability and Performance: Communications service shall be provided 24 hours per day on a continuous basis. The service must be reliable and must have an error transmission rate of one in ten million or less. The service shall have an operational availability of 99.5 % or greater calculated for each calendar day.  The reliability, maintainability and availability parameters defined in this specification do not include any impact due to Government equipment outages. All preventive maintenance should be transparent to the Government.  Any interruption in service will be treated as an outage subject to an outage recovery formula as mutually agreed upon after contract award. (b) Globally accessible. The communications service shall be globally accessible allowing NOAA to easily add communication sites (e .g., Vietnam, Greece, and Nigeria are expected to be added next year.)  The service shall also allow NOAA to easily remove or modify communication sites without notice to the vendor.

<CONTACT>William Woodring, Contract Negotiator, Phone 215-697-9644, Fax 215-697-5418, Email william.a.woodring@navy.mil
<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Detachment Philadelphia intends to acquire on an other than full and open competitive basis, software system design, development, analysis, and maintenance services in support of the Joint Theater Level Simulation (JTLS) system of the Joint Warfighting Center (JWFC) of the U. S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), Suffolk, VA.  The requirement is for twelve months of services, anticipated to commence 1 January 2004, with two option years.

The mission of JWFC is to provide a training environment where Joint Task Force Commanders can learn to develop and implement joint force doctrine, tactics, and procedures in a realistic facility, using computer-simulated scenarios instead of actual troop deployment.  JWFC supports Mission Integration and Rehearsals for assigned forces, where tactics and procedures are developed and practiced in the event of a real-world crisis.  The requirements of this acquisition focus on the continued design, development, analysis, and maintenance of the JTLS system, as well as exercise database tests and technical support during exercise execution.  The JTLS is an interactive, computer-assisted simulation system that models multi-sided air, ground, and naval combat, with the purpose of evaluating contingency operations plans to determine if such plans would in fact accomplish the mission envisioned by military and political planners and doctrinaires.

The JTLS configuration is the only software system that meets the technological requirements of the Joint Training Program mission.  The acquisition is being processed on the basis of Other than Full and Open Competition, sole source to Rolands & Associates Corporation, 500 Sloat Ave., Monterey, CA 93940-3535 under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Rolands & Associates Corporation is considered the only responsible source capable of providing the required support of the JTLS system, as this firm designed and developed the JTLS and has been the only source that has made continuous functional and system upgrades since system implementaion in 1983. Furthermore, as this acquisition requires the provision to the Government of any and all changes to system software modules, including source code, Rolands & Associates Corporation is considered the only responsible source capable of fulfilling the Government’s requirements.  Consequently, Government-wide Numbered Note #22 applies to this procurement.

All other responsible sources may submit concise documentation for consideration regarding their ability to provide the required services, as well as financial and technical information.  However, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Furthermore, no contract award will be made on the basis of information received in response to this notice and the Navy will not pay for any information provided.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Such information, if submitted, should be forwarded to FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Ave., Bldg. 2B, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5083, to the attention of W. A. Woodring, Code 02P22B, and reference Solicitation N00140-04-R-H008.  If no affirmative written responses advantageous to the Navy are received within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication of this notice, Rolands & Associates Corporation will be solicited, pursuant to FAR 12.203, to provide the required services.  The placement of a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract is contemplated, with services performed at the contractor’s facilities and Government facilities located in Suffolk, VA.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 514210.

If a competitive solicitation is issued, no additional synopsis will be published.  Any such solicitation will be issued to the intended vendor and all firms that respond to this synopsis of intent or otherwise request a copy of the solicitation.  A letter requesting a copy of the solicitation should be mailed to the above address or telefaxed to 215-697-9738, Attn: Bid Room, Code 02P52.  Upon release, the solicitation will be available at the Navy Electronic Commerce Office (NECO) web address: http://neco.navy.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement, with administrative corrections, pursuant to FAR 35.016(c).  The administrative corrections (1) correct the office symbol of the technical POC, (2) updates the contracting POC in the body of the announcement, (3) deletes the ombudsman program for the announcement and (4) deletes the requirement to send IFB a copy of the white paper cover letter.  Technical POC: Bernard J. Clarke, Program Manager, 315-330-2106; Bernard.Clarke@rl.af.mil) and Contracting POC: Renee F. Arcuri, Contracting Officer, 315-330-4777; (Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil). AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the following topic areas: AFRL seeks to support the intelligence community by developing systems and software tools for the collection, processing, analysis, simulation and modeling of directed energy weapons. The weapons of interest include radio frequency (RF), charged particle beam, neutral particle beam, and lasers. Of interest are not only high-tech military threats, but also the capability to gain intelligence information from weapons built from Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) components or commercially available turnkey systems. The directed energy threats of interest may include ground-based, airborne and space-based threats. Proposed collection systems may be intended for airborne, space-based or ground based platforms. White papers offered for consideration should provide a means to assist in the analysis of Scientific and Technical (S&T) analysis of directed energy threats. Beam characteristics of interest with respect to particle beam weapons include: particle type, beam energy, beam current, spread, pulse width (PW), and pulse repetition interval (PRI). S&T parameters of interest for laser intelligence (LASINT) and RF directed energy include: wavelength, PW, PRI, laser output power, beam divergence, continuous wave or pulsed, and angle of arrival (AOA). THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to four (4) page white paper with a cover letter. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Bernard Clarke, Reference BAA-01-03-IFKPA, AFRL/IFEC, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4114. Multiple white papers may be submitted in different areas of technology. White papers will be accepted until September 30, 2005. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent award. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under the announcement. Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: a) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, b) The innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, c) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, and d) The Government will consider other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to perform the requirements of the effort. The criteria used to evaluate proposals will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government. Only (a), (b), and (c) above will apply to white papers. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY-01. Individual awards will normally range from 6 months to 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $25,000 to $2,000,000 per year. Total funding for this BAA is approximately $15M. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submissions. All responsible firms may submit a white paper, which shall be considered. Responders are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission as well as a fax number, and an e-mail address. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, Renee F. Arcuri, for information if they contemplate responding. Export-controlled technical data may be involved; only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed to access such data. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistic Service Center at 1-800-352-3572. Selected offerors may be required to review classified material up to the SCI level, therefore personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for, or access to SCI information. Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require an SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability. The cost of preparing proposals in response this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY-01- 01 Mar 01; FY-02-30Jul01; FY-03-30Jul02; FY-04-30Jul03 FY-05-30Jul05. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each Fiscal Year after the dates cited. This BAA is open and effective until September 30, 2005. A copy of the Rome "BAA & PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html. All responsible organizations may submit a white paper, which shall be considered. Offerors are warned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>NA The Explosives Ordnance Disposal/Low Intensity Conflict (EOD/LIC) Program of the Combating Terrorism Technology Support Office solicits interest from any party interested in the licensing and production of the Large Package Inspection Apparatus, a device t hat assists bomb squads in the function of X-Raying large suspect Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) that may be hidden in large packages.  The use of X-Rays by Bomb Technicians is to identify and detect explosive devices hidden in suspect packages.  Eigh t by ten inch Polaroid film cassettes are the standard and are readily available to Bomb Technicians. The current method is to attach a multitude of these standard 8 inch by 10 inch film cassettes to a locally fabricated frame that would hold firmly more t han one cassette in order to x-ray large packages.  LAPAXA fulfills the need for a mechanical method to gang film cassettes in an easy, modular and functional fashion.  LAPAXA is a modular, expandable suitcase multiple film cassette holder, constructed usi ng a metal frame and polyethylene foam materials, for ganging from 2 to 12 each 8 nches x 10 inches x-ray cassettes in various configurations for use in X-Ray examination of suspect packages.  This device/frame facilitates set up time and reduce an EOD tec hnician's time on target.  The apparatus will be used to x-ray large items where muliple cassettes would be required.  Such items are brief cases, large packages, boxes and metal drums.  The frame is easy to use and configurable in multiple ways to support  cassettes stacked in various orientations:  3 high - two wide; 2 hight - 4 wide; etc.  The device is capable of being utilized on uneven terrain.  A patent for LAPAXA has been applied for.  A development and test report, drawing package and market assesme nt are available for review by interested companies.  Any company interested in the licensing, production, marketing, and sales of this device is invited to send a notice of interest via e-mail to the following address:  TechTrans@tswg.gov.

<DESC>IF YOU WOULD LIKE A MORE EASILY READABLE COPY OF THIS NOTICE, PLEASE CONTACT SUE PROCTOR AT 708-786-5182 OR SUSAN.PROCTOR@MED.VA.GOV SUBJ:  Sources Sought Notice for Medical/Surgical Items  This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various medical/surgical items.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA’s purchasing of products.  BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  Request for Quotations (RFQs) will be issued at a later date.   Potential offerors interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.  Samples are to be provided at no charge and all samples submitted in response to this notice become property of the VA and will not be returned following the evaluation process.  Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process.  If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria.   NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).  THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.  A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart_25_1.html#1046559.  All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer’s name.  Offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples.  Detailed product literature should include, but not limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.  Offerors must include a copy of the evaluation criteria contained in this notice with their samples and identify where in the product literature each individual criteria is addressed.  If the product literature does not clearly address any of the criteria information, offerors must provide this information on company letterhead addressing the stated criteria.  In addition, please provide company name, address, contact person and telephone number for questions pertaining to submitted samples.  Also, please provide the company name, address, contact person and telephone number of where any resulting Request for Quotation (RFQ) should be sent.

Offerors are requested to provide procurement history data for the products submitted for evaluation.  Please provide total quantities for each product sold to the VA in the previous 12-month period.  This information will be used to verify the accuracy of the estimated quantities identified in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). VA intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against FSS contracts rather than issuing formal solicitations for the purpose of standardization.  Those companies who do not have a current FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition prior to any subsequent BPA award.  For additional information in obtaining an FSS contract, please contact James Booth, Federal Supply Schedule Service at 708/786-5183.  Offerors who have a current FSS contract, must ensure that product samples submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice are included on their FSS contract prior to any subsequent BPA award. VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotation. Current FSS contract holders must provide a copy of their current FSS pricelist with their samples.  If you do not have a current FSS contract, please indicate if a proposal has been submitted to begin the procurement process that will result in an FSS contract. The VHA Medical/Surgical User Group, a group of VA physicians, nurses, and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted.  VA deems the members of the User Group to be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to make a subjective determination as to which products are acceptable.   **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Consolidated Acquisition and Analysis Service (049A5S), ATTN:  Carl Hunter, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL  60141**   SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN OCTOBER 31, 2003.

<DESC>IF YOU WOULD LIKE A MORE EASILY READABLE COPY OF THIS NOTICE, PLEASE CONTACT SUE PROCTOR AT 708-786-5182 OR SUSAN.PROCTOR@MED.VA.GOV SUBJ:  Sources Sought Notice for Medical/Surgical Items  This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various medical/surgical items.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA’s purchasing of products.  BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  Request for Quotations (RFQs) will be issued at a later date.   Potential offerors interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.  Samples are to be provided at no charge and all samples submitted in response to this notice become property of the VA and will not be returned following the evaluation process.  Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process.  If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria.   NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).  THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.  A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart_25_1.html#1046559.  All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer’s name.  Offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples.  Detailed product literature should include, but not limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.  Offerors must include a copy of the evaluation criteria contained in this notice with their samples and identify where in the product literature each individual criteria is addressed.  If the product literature does not clearly address any of the criteria information, offerors must provide this information on company letterhead addressing the stated criteria.  In addition, please provide company name, address, contact person and telephone number for questions pertaining to submitted samples.  Also, please provide the company name, address, contact person and telephone number of where any resulting Request for Quotation (RFQ) should be sent.  If detailed literature or sufficient information addressing the evaluation criteria is not received with the samples, the technical evaluation panel will be unable to fully evaluate the samples and the products will be eliminated from further consideration. Offerors are requested to provide procurement history data for the products submitted for evaluation.  Please provide total quantities for each product sold to the VA in the previous 12-month period.  This information will be used to verify the accuracy of the estimated quantities identified in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). VA intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against FSS contracts rather than issuing formal solicitations for the purpose of standardization.  Those companies who do not have a current FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition prior to any subsequent BPA award.  For additional information in obtaining an FSS contract, please contact James Booth, Federal Supply Schedule Service at 708/786-5183.  Offerors who have a current FSS contract, must ensure that product samples submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice are included on their FSS contract prior to any subsequent BPA award. VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotation. Current FSS contract holders must provide a copy of their current FSS pricelist with their samples.  If you do not have a current FSS contract, please indicate if a proposal has been submitted to begin the procurement process that will result in an FSS contract. The VHA Medical/Surgical User Group, a group of VA physicians, nurses, and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted.  VA deems the members of the User Group to be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to make a subjective determination as to which products are acceptable.   **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Consolidated Acquisition and Analysis Service (049A5S), ATTN:  Carl Hunter, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL  60141**   SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN OCTOBER 31, 2003.

<SUBJECT>10--POTENTIAL SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR SPECIAL OPERATIONS PECULIAR MODIFICATION WEAPONS KIT PROGRAM (SOPMOD) INTEGRATED PRODUCT TEAM (IPT) MEETING FOR THE ENHANCED GRENADE LAUNCHER MODULE (EGLM)
<DESC>PURPOSE:  This Commercial Area Announcement (CAA) updates activities under previous solicitation N00164-02-D-0063.  This CAA announces the intent of Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane, to hold an Integrated Product Team (IPT) meeting with industry interaction for the Enhanced Grenade Launcher Module (EGLM). The purpose of this IPT meeting is to: (1) Refine the EGLM Operational Requirements Document (ORD) Annex, which outlines the requirements and future of the EGLM project; (2) Refine the Performance Specification for the EGLM, and (3) provide a forum for direct, closed-session interaction between industry, Special Operators (end users), and acquisition personnel. BACKGROUND: The EGLM is a sub-program of the Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) Program, which was established in 1994. The mission of the SOPMOD Program Management Office (PMO) at NSWC Crane,  IN is to provide standardized, versatile weapons accessories to meet needs across Special Operations Forces (SOF) mission scenarios.  These accessories will increase operator survivability and lethality by enhanced weapon performance, target acquisition, signature suppression, and fire control.  SOPMOD PMO provides these accessories when they are operationally suitable, affordable, sustainable, and funded.  SOPMOD supports Army, Navy, and Air Force Special Operations Units, as well as a variety of other US military units and agencies.  EGLM is in its third year of development as a subsystem project of SOPMOD.  In September of 2000, at the request of a Special Operations Forces (SOF) Requirements Working Group (RWG), SOPMOD PMO conducted a Vendor Technology Demonstration of Grenade Launchers.  Nine vendors demonstrated their grenade launchers to 32 Army, Navy and Air Force comb atant operators in round-robin assessment.  Three new grenade launchers were found superior to the existing M79 and M203 grenade launchers.  The demonstration generated industry and command interest, leading to an un-requested Congressional R&D Plus Up in Sept FY00 of $873K for EGLM research.  EGLM project had its second interaction with industry in July of 2001 at the SOPMOD Industry conference.  On 28 February 2002, the initial draft specification was released for early industry comment.  On 3 October 2002, the EGLM project office issued a separate combined synopsis/solicitation N00164-03-Q-0007 seeking working demonstration samples of EGLM candidates.  Two firms provided working prototypes during 2003.  These prototypes demonstrate that that fundamental capabilities envisioned in EGLM are achievable within the performance plan of the currently drafted ORD Annex, leading to t his CAA.   STATUS:  EGLM has continuing support by Congress and USSOCOM component commands.  EGLM is an approved Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) activity for FY03 and FY04.  On 27 August of this year, SOPMOD Program Integrated Product Team (PIPT) and Requirements Working Group (RWG) meeting convened at MacDill Air Force base in Tampa, Florida. The result of these meetings for the EGLM sub-program was to develop an EGLM ORD Annex.  This ORD Annex has been drafted and is awaiting industry and user comments, before being staffed for validation.  EGLM Performance Specification is also included for comment. AQCQUISITION SUMMARY:  The EGLM acquisition effort will utilize a Best Value approach.  Offers will be evaluated to determine compliance with a Performance Specification.  The Performance Specification is published in draft form for public comment in this CAA, and will appea r in final form in a future solicitation.  The offers will then be evaluated to determine if the proposals/product samples exceed the stated threshold requirements and whether or not those excesses are beneficial to the Government.  Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) will be awarded to selected vendor(s).  CAPABILITIES SUMMARY:  The EGLM project consists of four (4) distinct increments.  These increments are necessary to allow development of emerging technologies, enabling evolutionary architecture to fully mature.  Each increment is designed to increase the capability of the warfighter by fielding sequential partial capabilities/solutions when authorized by a favorable Milestone C production and fielding decision.  The EGLM developmental increments are: (1) Increment One will consist of a new 40 MM grenade launcher with a modular fire control sub-sys tem that provides ranging capabilities.  The EGLM (Increment One) will replace the aging M203 and the M79 currently fielded to SOF. (2) Increment Two envisions upgrade to fire control capability that may have not been achieved in Increment One.  Such upgrades may include (a) Integration of aiming and ranging technologies; (b) An automatic adjusting aiming point; (C) Incorporation of programming pathways for future programmable 40mm ammunition; (D) Integration of multiple ballistic programming solutions for various U.S. ammunition; (e) incorporation of a shot counter.  (3) Increment Three Introduces Enhanced Indirect Fire Munitions (EIFM) involving 40mm munitions and fusing development.  Increment three will call for development of four 40mm rounds with the following capabilities: (A) Selectable air bursting, point detonating, and delay (HEDP-TM) capability in a single round of  ammunition;(B) Break Contact and other close-range applications; (C) Over Pressure / MOUT capability, providing enhanced lethality in enclosed spaces; (D) Infrared illumination. (4) Increment Four shall entail final system integration, fully unifying improvements of previous increments, including new developments, such as: (A) Technology insertion of higher velocity/longer-range rounds; (B) Analysis, computation, and insertion of total ballistic solution of various types of 40mm munitions, to include foreign/allied rounds. INVITATION:  This invitation is specifically being issued to schedule appointment(s) for a face-to-face closed session meeting between industry individuals/teams and the government/user community.  The IPT is scheduled to conduct closed session meetings from 5-6 November 2003 at Adams Mark, 430 S. Gulfview Blvd., Clearwater Beach, FL 33767 (Phone (727)443- 5714).

These prototypes demonstrate that that fundamental capabilities envisioned in EGLM are achievable within the performance plan of the currently drafted ORD Annex, leading to t his CAA.   STATUS:  EGLM has continuing support by Congress and USSOCOM component commands.  EGLM is an approved Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) activity for FY03 and FY04.  On 27 August of this year, SOPMOD Program Integrated Product Team (PIPT) and Requirements Working Group (RWG) meeting convened at MacDill Air Force base in Tampa, Florida. The result of these meetings for the EGLM sub-program was to develop an EGLM ORD Annex.  This ORD Annex has been drafted and is awaiting industry and user comments, before being staffed for validation.  EGLM Performance Specification is also included for comment. AQCQUISITION SUMMARY:  The EGLM acquisition effort will utilize a Best Value approach.  Offers will be evaluated to determine compliance with a Performance Specification.  The Performance Specification is published in draft form for public comment in this CAA, and will appea r in final form in a future solicitation.  The offers will then be evaluated to determine if the proposals/product samples exceed the stated threshold requirements and whether or not those excesses are beneficial to the Government.  Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) will be awarded to selected vendor(s).  CAPABILITIES SUMMARY:  The EGLM project consists of four (4) distinct increments.  These increments are necessary to allow development of emerging technologies, enabling evolutionary architecture to fully mature.  Each increment is designed to increase the capability of the warfighter by fielding sequential partial capabilities/solutions when authorized by a favorable Milestone C production and fielding decision.  The EGLM developmental increments are: (1) Increment One will consist of a new 40 MM grenade launcher with a modular fire control sub-sys tem that provides ranging capabilities.  The EGLM (Increment One) will replace the aging M203 and the M79 currently fielded to SOF. (2) Increment Two envisions upgrade to fire control capability that may have not been achieved in Increment One.  Such upgrades may include (a) Integration of aiming and ranging technologies; (b) An automatic adjusting aiming point; (C) Incorporation of programming pathways for future programmable 40mm ammunition; (D) Integration of multiple ballistic programming solutions for various U.S. ammunition; (e) incorporation of a shot counter.  (3) Increment Three Introduces Enhanced Indirect Fire Munitions (EIFM) involving 40mm munitions and fusing development.  Increment three will call for development of four 40mm rounds with the following capabilities: (A) Selectable air bursting, point detonating, and delay (HEDP-TM) capability in a single round of  ammunition;(B) Break Contact and other close-range applications; (C) Over Pressure / MOUT capability, providing enhanced lethality in enclosed spaces; (D) Infrared illumination. (4) Increment Four shall entail final system integration, fully unifying improvements of previous increments, including new developments, such as: (A) Technology insertion of higher velocity/longer-range rounds; (B) Analysis, computation, and insertion of total ballistic solution of various types of 40mm munitions, to include foreign/allied rounds.

<SUBJECT>A -- EXPEDITIONARY COMBAT SUPPORT CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT
<DESC>The U.S. Air Force Air Armament Center’s (AAC) Plans & Programs Division requests assistance in identifying potential capability enablers, concepts, and technologies for Combat Air Forces in an Expeditionary Combat Support environment.  The AAC Plans & Programs office is interested in obtaining information from industry, academia, and the DOD research laboratory network for innovative technologies and approaches that afford potential to achieve enhanced capabilities.  The Air Force needs an integrated, expanded, and enhanced Expeditionary Combat Support capability to support Expeditionary Aerospace Forces across a full spectrum of military operations. Expeditionary Combat Support is comprised of equipment and systems that deploy in support of deployed combat support operations.  Aerospace Forces must have an immediate capability to safely and efficiently operate, survive, and sustain operations in all expeditionary combat scenarios and must achieve a lighter, leaner, and more rapidly deployable combat support capability.  Expeditionary capability requires easily deployable resources, equipment, and systems.  Fielded capabilities will be integrated, and employed in support Aerospace Expeditionary Forces.   This Request for Information is limited to these specific Combat Support Capability areas (provided via separate document) posted under this RFI tracking number.  To be a viable capability contributor, submissions must apply to one or more of the above-specified Agile Combat Support capability areas.  Initial forces often arrive with minimal support and resources.  Deployment of equipment and systems may be constrained by limited airlift or transport.  Pre-positioning assets in area of operations may be constrained by international agreements or lack there-of.  Plans, transportation, and manpower may be constrained by short-notice execution orders, budgetary constraints, or other force engagements.  Integrated, modularized capabilities serve to mitigate these conditions.  Deployed capability needing less inter-theater airlift and manpower to operate, erect, & maintain capability to reduce deployment weight and cube by 50-percent over existing footprint.  All of thes parameters are inherent goals of the RFI.  Capabilities are based on demand for enhanced performance and sustainment of forces in a forward environment.  Potential offerors may wish to consult unclassified lessons-learned under Expeditionary Aerospace Force operations.   Overarching determinations from this RFI are to field leaner, lighter, and more responsive Expeditionary Combat Support capabilities.  Present capabilities consume inordinate manpower, lift capacity and sustainment recourses and are not tractable enough for desired levels of capability.  Viable capability enhancers shall include technologies that are projected to mature within the following timeframes: Near-term=(2004-2007), Mid-term= (2008-2015), Far-term=(2016-2029).  Although, Near-term contributors usually are commercially available or maturing technology, there must be an overwhelming capability requirement before inclusion in current budgets.  Those capability contributors that fall within the mid and far-term applications may require research and development projects to achieve quantum leaps in technological capability improvements.  Respondents shall keep in mind those out-year contributors offer greater flexibility in programming application under current fiscal planning, programming and budgeting cycles.  Viable capability enablers that meet the above criteria will be published under the U.S. Air Force Agile Combat Support Mission Area Plan.  Operational capability achieved through reductions of manpower and logistical footprints are of particular interest and cannot be over emphasized in this RFI.  Those capability-enhancing multipliers will result in the U.S. Air Force Air Armament Center contacting originators for presentation media and points of contact suitable for additional technical briefings.  Selected briefings are planned for presentation before an Expeditionary Combat Support Panel (March 2004) at Air Armament Summit VI.  Concept data must provide sufficient detail regarding processes, technologies, approaches, and capability enhancements for the Government to assess technical maturity, risk, performance, and life cycle cost.  Additionally, viable capability enablers and enhancements will be included in a Combat Air Forces Agile Combat Support Development Plan and roadmaps for consideration in coming programming cycles.  Submission of concepts under this RFI requires a Capability Template (provided in a separtate document) posted under this RFI tracking number.  Each concept/solution shall not exceed three pages, by expanding blocks of the template to provide details for each capability.  The Capability Template is compulsory for a capability submission to be responsive.  Each response must be received at the: Air Armament Center, 207 West D Avenue, Suite 301, Bldg-349, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6088  (Mail Stop: WMX) NLT: 30 November 2003.  Data submissions may be via: Email attachment for unclassified data using MS Word or PDF Formats or via authorized delivery means for any classified data presentations authorized under DOD security procedures.   Mark all proprietary information “For Government Use Only”.  This request for information is intended to obtain information to improve Expeditionary Combat Support Capability.   This solicitation is for information and planning purposes only.  This announcement must not be construed as a commitment by the Government nor any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract.  The Government does not intend to award a contract based solely upon this Request for Information or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

Currently, the Cospas-Sarsat system consists of an MCC in Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Taipei, United Kingdom, and the United States.  MCCs are being planned in Greece, Nigeria, Thailand, and Vietnam.  Further information concerning Cospas-Sarsat can be found at http://www.cospas_sarsat.org/  and http://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/ . The United States Mission Control Center (USMCC) is located in Suitland, MD.    The current primary means for the exchange of non-alert and alert information between the USMCC and other MCCs is X.25 via Packet Switched Data Networks (PSDNs) and an X.75 international gateway provided by MCI.   It should be noted that the data volume among MCCs is low and 56 kbps links are more than sufficient. NOAA/NESDIS has a requirement for access to an alternative X.75 gateway under the bidder's control, preferably in the United States, or in another country if a domestic gateway is unavailable, that can be accessed to allow the USMCC to continue X.25 data communications until at least 2010. The current figures and percentages are:  (a) OUTGOING TRAFFIC:  356 messages per day, averaging 200k bytes in a range of 150k to 250k bytes and where X.25 represents 42% of the total; and (b) INCOMING TRAFFIC: 231 messages per day, averaging 123k bytes in a range of 73k to 173k bytes and where X.25 represents 80% of the total. All X.25 connections originate and terminate at a Government X.25 switch. The contractor is required to provide the services and capabilities such that the USMCC can send/receive messages internationally by X.25. International Alphabet 5 used for messages to and from the USMCC is a hard requirement. The format and content of all the international messages sent and received by the USMCC are defined in "COSPAS/SARSAT Mission Control Centres Standard Interface Description", C/S A.002.  The Government requires the following Specific Capabilities and Characteristics. The contractor will provide international communication services as follows:  (a) provide a dedicated X.25 line to Suitland, MD to allow for simultaneous transmitting and receiving over a minimum of 64 virtual circuits; (b) provide circuit status confirmation;  (c) allow for addition/removal/ modification of communication sites and or services  without any changes or modifications to the contract; (d) at a minimum, handle transmission speeds between the USMCC and the vendors facility at 9.6kbps on an RS-232C physical interface.  The USMCC can also accept speeds ranging from 9.6kbps through 64kbps on a V.35 or RS-232C physical interface;  (e) the X.25 protocol must support the CCITT 1980, 1984 and 1988 standards;    (f) allow for an individual message size of up to 25,000 characters and ensure that message contents shall not be altered; (g) provide for a backup access to the vendor's network in the event of a failure of the dedicated line; and, (h) all of the above is to be duplicated at our Lanham, MD site except for the backup access sited in item (g). Outages will be subject to a recovery formula as mutually agreed upon after contract award. The Conditions of Services are as follows: (a) Communication Availability and Performance: Communications service shall be provided 24 hours per day on a continuous basis. The service must have an error transmission rate of one in ten million or less. The service shall have an operational availability of 99.5 % or greater calculated for each calendar day.  The reliability, maintainability and availability parameters defined in this specification do not include any impact due to Government equipment outages. All preventive maintenance should be transparent to the Government.  Any interruption in service will be treated as an outage subject to an outage recovery formula as mutually agreed upon after contract award. (b) Globally accessible: The communications service shall be globally accessible allowing NOAA to easily add communication sites (e.g., Vietnam, Greece, and Nigeria are expected to be added next year.)  The service shall also allow NOAA to easily remove or modify communication sites without notice to the vendor on the presumption that the vendor has a communications agreement in place with the nation accommodating that site. (c) Responsive maintenance: Due to the critical nature of the information to be disseminated, the contractor shall provide a single point of contact for trouble reporting and provide 24-hour trouble support with a response time not to exceed two (2) hours for the commencement of trouble resolution.  The USMCC shall be notified at least 48 hours in advance of any unavoidable, scheduled outage. The communications service shall provide for automatic rerouting of messages within the network to eliminate single points of failure within the cloud. The communications service shall provide circuit status confirmation and provide a timely method of receipt verification. (d) Security: The communications service shall provide the resources to ensure that inbound traffic is restricted to authorized call-ins designated by the USMCC and all inbound traffic is authenticated using parameters such as calling address, called address and call user data. (e) Other Considerations: The minimum transmission speed to the network must be 9.6 kbps; a service requirement above 56 kbps is not anticipated or required. The Contractor shall comply with the following reporting requirements during the installation phase of the work: the Contractor shall attend weekly telecoms with the participants and the customer(s); the Contractor shall attend a formal mid-point briefing to be given for NOAA; and the Contractor shall attend a final formal briefing that will be given by NOAA and in which the Contractor shall provide an annotated final report.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS, AND IS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6 - STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS - AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICTATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.  The solicitation number is EC3000-204-02 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.  The associated North American Industrial Classification system (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 517410 with a small business size standard of $12.5 million. This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible parties may submit a quote. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) manages the Nation's operational geostationary and polar-orbiting environmental satellites, and manages a large collection of atmospheric, geophysical and oceanographic data. Within NESDIS, the Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPD) manages and directs the operation of the central ground facilities which ingest, process, and distribute environmental satellite data and derived products to domestic and foreign users.  The Direct Services Division (DSD) of the OSDPD manages and operates the Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT) program.  The SARSAT program and system are part of the international Cospas-Sarsat System which is an international system designed to provide distress alert and location data to assist search and rescue (SAR) operations, using spacecraft and ground facilities to detect and locate the signals of distress beacons operating on 406 Megahertz (MHz) or 121.5 MHz.   The position of the distress and other related information is forwarded by the responsible Cospas-Sarsat Mission Control Center (MCC) to the appropriate SAR authorities. Currently, the Cospas-Sarsat system consists of an MCC in Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Taipei, United Kingdom, and the United States.   MCCs are being planned in Greece, Nigeria, Thailand, and Vietnam. Telex and fax messages are sent from the U.S. Mission Control Center (USMCC) to various international SAR Points Of Contact (SPOCs) and U.S. Rescue Coordination Centers (RCCs).  The USMCC is located in Suitland, MD. Further information concerning Cospas-Sarsat can be found at http://www.cospas_sarsat.org/   and http://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/.    NOAA/NESDIS has a requirement for the acquisition of messaging services that provide the USMCC capabilities to send facsimile message and send and receive telex messages.

It should be noted that the data volume among MCCs and the RCCs is low and a data rate of not less than 9.6 kbps nor more than 56 kbps are adequate for the mission. The current average byte volume per fax and telex is as follows: we send about 3500 faxes per month [117 per day]; we send about 160 Telex messages per month [5 per day]; and, we receive about 50 telex messages per month [2 per day]. Sample telex and fax messages appear in Appendix 1. Countries requiring telex and fax are shown in Appendix 2.  The USMCC requires near real-time automatic delivery i.e. a delivery time not to exceed 15 minutes from the beginning of a transmission to its receipt. The contractor is required to provide the services and capabilities such that the USMCC can send/receive telex messages, and send fax messages over a X.25 connection or other vendor provided transport or the Internet between the USMCC and the contractor's network. The International Alphabet 5 used for messages to and from the USMCC is a hard requirement. The format and content of all the international messages sent and received by the USMCC are defined in "COSPAS/SARSAT Mission Control Centres Standard Interface Description", C/S A.002.  The Government requires the following Specific Capabilities and Characteristics. The contractor will provide  communication services as follows: (a) provide circuit status confirmation; (b) allow for addition/removal/ modification of communication sites and or services (telex, or fax) without any changes or modifications to the contract; (c) telex service must have connection to international telex and be  as close to universal as possible; (d) at a minimum, handle transmission speeds between the USMCC and the vendors facility at 9.6kbps;  messages designated for fax or telex delivery must be delivered in near real-time, which for the purposes of this contract, is defined as no longer than 15 minutes from the start of transmission to start of receipt of message at destination; (e) provide a timely method of receipt verification (not to exceed 15 minutes); (f) the X.25 protocol, if used, must support the CCITT 1980, 1984 and 1988 standards; (g) provide a timely method of delivery failure notification to the USMCC (not to exceed 15 minutes); (h) allow for an individual message size of up to 25,000 characters and ensure that message contents shall not be altered; (i) handle text format using International Alphabet #5 (IA5) representation; and (j)  all of the above is to be duplicated at our Lanham, MD site. Outages will be subject to a recovery formula as mutually agreed upon after contract award. The Conditions of Services are as follows: (a) Communication Availability and Performance: Communications service shall be provided 24 hours per day on a continuous basis.
