In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer.

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Justification: supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, technical, and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.

<DESC>NASA/ARC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Shadow Mode Assessments Using Realistic Technologies for the National Airspace System (SMART-NAS). NASA has a need to develop SMART-NAS capability to accelerate transformation of the NAS. SMART-NAS will allow integrated, real-time and/or fast time assessment of gate-to-gate operations and their performance using real-world NAS inputs. SMART-NAS will allow for plug-and-play of different technologies to operate in combined real, virtual, and constructive manners as dictated by the study goals. The goal of the SMART-NAS initiative is to develop a capability to explore alternative concepts, technologies, and architectures at the NAS level in an integrated manner. SMART-NAS will enable assessments to demonstrate feasibility and benefits for modernization-related decision making. The work contemplated under this contract is outlined in the attached draft statement of work. The work will require travel to NASA Ames and NASA Langley centers. This Pre-solicitation Synopsis is issued to replace the Pre-solicitation Synopsis NNA13469771L posted on April 12, 2013.

<DESC>The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-291, 124 stat. 3064) was signed into law on December 8, 2010.  Title VI of the Claims Resolution Act authorizes the Aamodt Litigation Settlement Project which includes: (1) the Aamodt Settlement Agreement; (2) construction of the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water System (RWS); (3) acquisition of water rights by the United States to be held in trust for the Pueblos of Nambe, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso and Tesuque (four pueblos); and (4) establishment of the Aamodt Settlement Pueblos' Fund.  The Act directs the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a contract with the four pueblos for 1,079 acre-feet of San Juan-Chama Project (SJ-CP) water.  This water will become part of the supply for the RWS.
Reclamation has a requirement to evaluate the amount of SJ-CP water needed on a long-term basis to offset evaporation losses from the 1200 surface acre Cochiti Reservoir Recreation Pool, as part of the implementation of the Aamodt Litigation Settlement Project.  This requirement includes updating the riverware-based planning version of the Upper Rio Grande Water Operations Model (URGWOM); analysis of evaporative losses under various hydrological and operational scenarios; report preparation and presentation of results to Reclamation and its stakeholders, including a discussion of the assumptions, results, and technical methodology used for the evaluation.
More specifically, the Contractor shall update URGWOM with new, government-furnished, elevation-area-capacity tables and sediment parameters for Cochiti Reservoir and then use the updated model to evaluate the amount of SJ-CP water needed to offset evaporation losses from the 1200 surface acre recreation pool at Cochiti Reservoir as described in the Performance Based Statement of Work.  Reclamation's stakeholders for this work include:  The New Mexico Office of the State Engineer, New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and all current SJ-CP contract holders.
This is a Total Small Business Set-Aside and the Bureau of Reclamation intends to issue a Request for Proposal for this project.
It is anticipated the contract will be a firm fixed price contract using procedures prescribed by FAR Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690 with a Size Standard of $14 million.  
All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  An electronic copy of the solicitation will be available within the next month at www.fbo.gov.

<p>Destination Information: STOCK @ HILL AFB, UTAH</p>

<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.<br />Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The solicitation will be available in DLA DIBBS on its issue date of 04/29/13. The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources are: PARKER-HANNIFIN CORPORATION (3H889) P/N 7033-1-1 &amp; LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION (81755) P/N 16VP002-3. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. It is anticipated that award will be made via a delivery order to an existing basic ordering agreement.</p>
<p>Reverse Auction: The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to award a Bridge Contract for the Multidisciplinary Engineering and Technical Services (METSII) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for the Applied Engineering and Technology Directorate (AETD) to ASRC on a Sole Source basis, due to the fact that the current METS II contract is meeting its ceiling much earlier than originally anticipated. The Bridge Contract would ensure continuing performance of mission-critical support currently provided through task orders issued under the METS II contract, until the competitive follow-on contract can be awarded. Awarding a Bridge contract to ASRC will avoid unnecessary duplication of effort as competition for a follow-on contract (METS III) is underway. ASRC as the current incumbent, is the only responsible source qualified to perform this requirement due to its current performance of tasks related to numerous complex NASA flight programs such as James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Magnetosphere Multi-scale Mission (MMS), Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), ICESat II/Atlas, and Mars Atmosphere Volatile Evolution (MAVEN), which all have critical schedules that must be met. The estimated non-competitive value of this bridge contract is $176,280,800; however, there will be a provision in the contract to increase the maximum ordering value up by an additional 30%, for a total of $229,154,040, if necessary. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1)Only One Responsible Source. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort, in writing, to the identified point of contact, not later than 4:00 p.m. local time on April 29, 2013. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html .

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract modification to contract number N00019-11-D-0024, which was awarded on 28 September 2011 to L-3 Communications Vertex Aerospace, LLC of Madison, MS. Contract N00019-11-D-0024 is an indefinite delivery requirements contract for total Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) services of Government owned T-39G and T-39N aircraft. This contract modification is expected to have a period of performance that will begin 30 September 2012 and run through the service life of the T-39 aircraft. Based on the United States Navy's (USN's) current divestiture plan, all T-39 aircraft will be out of service by September 2014. At that time, the Student Naval Flight Officer (SNFO) training program will be assumed by the T-45 aircraft and Virtual Mission Training System (VMTS). This contract modification is anticipated to have a one-year base period and one six-month option. FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services clause is included in the basic contract, and can be utilized in the event there is a delay in the VMTS program, which is currently on track. All work will be performed at NAS Pensacola, FL (NASP). <br />

<SUBJECT>J--Cost ceiling increase for contract N61331-08-D-0021 for Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) maintenance support services.  
<SOLNBR>N6133108D0021
<CONTACT>Otis Nattiel 8502344852
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), Panama City, Florida intends to negotiate and award a ceiling increase to Cost-Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract N61331-08-D-0021, on a sole source basis to the incumbent contractor, Gryphon Technologies, L.C. 6301 Ivy Lane Suite 300, Greenbelt, MD 20770.  This action will be supported by Justification and Approval 3066-0025.  This increase will bridge the gap created between the early expenditure of the cost ceiling against the current contract and the competitive award of a follow-on contract.  

This action is unsuitable for full and open completion as Gryphon is the only contractor that is currently mobilized specifically for this effort.
  Competitively soliciting and awarding a contract to another contractor would result in a lapse in mission critical Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) maintenance services and mobilization cost as justified and approved in Justification and Approval 3066-0025.

The proposed contract action is for services and materials for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination, by the Government, not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The closing date of this synopsis is 26 April 2013.  

Performance of this requirement will be at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City FL 32407.
  The additional services will be procured against contract N61331-08-D-0021, via the issuance of a task order, once the contract is modified.  Cost will be evaluated at the time of award.   

The Department of Defense will no longer award contracts to contractors not registered in the Central Contract Registration database. Registration may be accomplished by accessing the CCR website at http://ccr.gov.

The Contract Specialist for this action is: Mr. Otis Nattiel, NSWC PCD, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407; (850) 234-4852, FAX: (850) 234-4197; e-mail: otis.nattiel@navy.mil.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541380 - Testing Laboratories; annual receipts or $14.0M. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p><strong>Background.</strong> This procurement is entitled Genotyping of M. Tubercuosis Isolates. Genotyping (also referred to as DNA fingerprinting) of M. tuberculosis isolates using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with the insertion sequence IS6110 was introduced in 1990. Application of this technique to outbreaks investigated by the Division of Tuberculosis Elimination demonstrated the utility of strain typing for support of epidemiologic investigations and suggested this technology should be available to TB control programs nationwide. Because of the complexity of the technique and the limited number of isolates to be typed, it was decided that implementation in a small number of regional laboratories would be most efficient, which began in 1992. To further assess the utility of large scale typing, the National Tuberculosis Genotyping and Surveillance Network (NTGSN) was established in 1996. NTGSN included seven Sentinel Surveillance Sites and seven Regional DNA Fingerprinting Laboratories (hereinafter refered to as Regional Laboratories). The NTGSN conducted a prospective study of fingerprinting of isolates in the seven surveillance sites during calendar years 1996-2000. During this period, the Regional Laboratories provided genotyping services to their assigned regions in addition to performing genotyping of isolates from the Sentinel Surveillance Sites. The results of the NTGSN project confirmed the utility of universal, prospective genotyping for TB control and support the establishment of universal genotyping in the US. The project also highlighted limitations of the standard IS6110 RFLP method, including the slow turnaround time for results, high cost, limited throughput, and difficulties in analysis of complex fingerprint patterns.</p>
<p>To overcome these difficulties, newer, rapid methods have been introduced for primary genotyping. Spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR are PCR based typing methods that require minimal amounts of culture material, are conducive to high throughput analysis, have a fast turnaround time and provide a high level of discrimination. These methods have been used to provide universal genotyping services in the US. The National TB Genotyping Service consists of two laboratories which were selected by a competitive process in response to a request for proposal. The first contract provided for the genotyping of up to 5,000 isolates per year per laboratory during the time period September 2003 - September 2008 and a second contract continued the support of genotyping for the time period September 2008 - September 2013. As of January 2013, over 70,000 isolates have been submitted to these laboratories by TB control programs for genotyping. For those clusters of isolates that require further discrimination, the standard IS6110-RFLP method is available upon request as a secondary typing method. The service has been shown to be useful to the TB control programs by identifying numerous previously unidentified outbreaks, by defining limits of suspected outbreaks, and by detecting instances of false positive cultures.</p>
<p>The TB Genotyping Information Management System (TB GIMS) is a web based system developed by CDC to provide TB control programs with tools to manage and analyze genotyping data as well as to integrate genotyping information with the National TB Surveillance System. Submission of isolates for genotyping is now one of the TB Indicators used to evaluate TB control programs.<br />Purpose and Objectives. The purpose of this contract is to establish regional laboratories to provide genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in support of state and local tuberculosis (TB) control programs within the United States and research activities of the CDC Division of Tuberculosis Elimination (DTBE) and the Tuberculosis Epidemiologic Studies Consortium (TBESC). The goal will be to provide genotyping for one isolate from each newly diagnosed, culture-positive case of TB in the US.</p>
<p><strong>Project requirements.</strong> Scope of Work:<br /><br />The contractor shall, as an independent organization and not as an agent of the United States Government, furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities to perform the services required in the contract, except for equipment specifically listed in the statement of work as provided by CDC.</p>
<p>Technical Requriements. The contractor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1.0/ Communication: Communicate with public health laboratories and TB control programs in their assigned region via telephone, fax, and e-mail, to allow prior notice of shipment of cultures, confirmation of receipt of cultures, transmittal of results, and consultation on shipments. Provide physical security measures for maintenance of confidentiality of patient data.</p>
<p>Task 2.0/Submissions: Provide input on CDC established protocols at protocol discussion meeting for the submission of isolates for genotyping from submitting laboratories which include prior notification of shipment to contractor, submission form, proper containers and labeling, and enforce these protocols by rejecting any improperly prepared submission and providing consultation on proper submissions to submitting laboratory.</p>
<p>Task 3.0/Process submitted samples for genotyping: The following subtasks shall be completed by the contractor:</p>
<p>Subtask 3.1/Frozen stocks: Receive and log M. tuberculosis isolates for genotyping. Prepare two subcultures of each isolate. One subculture (0.5 mL) will be transferred to CDC no later than 90 calendar days after receipt of isolate. Maintain frozen subcultures (-70C) and a computerized inventory of isolates for duration of contract. Frozen subcultures shall be destroyed at conclusion of contract. The shipment of M. tuberculosis cultures must comply with all regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation for the shipment of Category A Infectious Substances (www.dot.gov). Shipping charges and containers will be the responsibility of the contractor.</p>
<p>Subtask 3.2/DNA Preparations: Prepare small scale DNA samples for rapid PCR-based assays. Retain frozen DNA samples (-20C) and maintain a computerized inventory. An aliquot (0.05 mL) will be transferred to CDC no later than five (5) days after receipt of isolate. Frozen samples will be maintained for five (5) years from the date of receipt of the corresponding isolates and will be transferred to CDC, if requested. All DNA samples will be transferred to CDC at the contract completion; shipping charges will be the responsibility of the contractor. DNA samples shall be prepared using the CDC protocol. Alternative protocols may be submitted to CDC along with validation of the protocol to provide DNA of sufficient quality for the spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR (subtask 3.4) assays.</p>
<p>Subtask 3.3/MIRU-VNTR: Perform mycobacterium interspersed repetitive unit-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) typing by amplification of MIRU loci by PCR followed by automated analysis on a capillary electrophoresis sequencing instrument (references attached). MIRU-VNTR analysis shall be conducted using the CDC protocol. Alternative protocols may be submitted to CDC along with validation of the protocol. Analyze data using CDC provided Microsoft Excel spreadsheets; confirm results with visual inspection of data. Training for all methods will be provided by CDC. No reagents will be provided by CDC.</p>
<p>Subtask 3.4/Reports: Prepare and upload genotyping reports to TB GIMS by importing results from excel spreadsheets into a CDC provided Microsoft Access database. Training for all methods will be provided by CDC. Contractor shall upload MIRU-VNTR result to TB GIMS no later than 15 days of receipt of isolate.</p>
<p>Task 4.0/IS6110 typing: Prepare purified DNA samples for IS6110 RFLP analysis and perform IS6110 typing by standard agarose gel electrophoresis, blotting, and hybridization methods on requested isolates. IS6110 typing will be performed as needed only after the results of the PCR-based typing are obtained and will only be performed on those isolates belonging to a PCR cluster in that jurisdiction. The decision to IS6110 type will be based on request by the relevant TB control program or by request of CDC. It is anticipated that less than 10% of submitted isolates will require IS6110 typing. IS6110 typing will be completed and results reported to the requesting program within 45 working days after the decision is made to perform typing. Contractor shall analyze results of IS6110 typing by pattern matching using computer software (Bionumerics). Patterns will only be compared to the patterns of those isolates belonging to the same PCR genotype cluster as defined by spoligotype and MIRU-VNTR pattern. Image files of specific IS6110 fingerprint patterns will be submitted to CDC when requested via e-mail. Training in these methods will not be provided by CDC. CDC will provide IS6110 marker.</p>
<p>Task 5.0/Data review: Provide to the CDC project officer copies of the output data files and the excel files from MIRU-VNTR and the genotyping Microsoft Access database on a monthly basis. All data should be stored on CD-ROM and be made to reach the CDC no later than 10 days after the end of the month. After review of data, repeat typing of any isolate will be at the discretion of the CDC Project Officer.</p>

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the National Center for Toxicological and Research (NCTR) requirement for a small animal monitoring and anatomical/physiological gating system.</p>
<p>The FDA is seeking business sources to determine the availability and capability of small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer, including total small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, 8(a) certified companies. Other than small business concerns are also encouraged to submit capability statements. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is- 334510- Electromedical and Electrotherapeutic Apparatus Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The FDA/NCTR requires one (1) multiple size small animal monitoring and anatomical/physiological gating system compatible with existing MRI system. The items shall be connected to an animal support system and Bruker MRI scanner, for physiological monitoring of all variable sizes of test subjects and providing the ability to trigger image acquisition according to the physiologic parameters (phase of respiration or cardiac cycle) and as such, is tailored for the specific configuration of the FDA's MRI scanner. The items shall be compatible with a seven tesla Bruker Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging system. This system consists of a modified Bruker Avance III imaging console and the computer support and analysis software to analyze the data from the imaging device. All components must be compatible to accomplish the magnetic resonance imaging experiment.</p>
<p>The monitoring and anatomical/physiological gating system shall maintain high signal sensitivity needed for fast and accurate measurement of desired parameters with high resolution and low noise. Parameters (sensors) include respiration, heart rate, blood oxygenation, core temperature and arterial blood pressure shall be measured and monitored within juvenile or infant monkeys (macaque), down to mice and rat sized experimental subjects while exposed to anesthesia and imaged within a high RF/ magnetic environment. The system shall accommodate this range of morpho-metric sizes and all the while monitor anatomical and physiological changes in the animal's body. It is desired that the parameters should be run by a single software and computer system so that all physiological data can be used simultaneously to generate parameter data. All sensors must not interfere with the MRI system. The animal monitoring and anatomical/physiological gating system shall be able to provide Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) triggering signals to control the MRI image acquisition. Approved for use by the manufacturer of MRI, Bruker BioSpin. The system shall maintaining high signal homogeneity and sensitivity. The monitoring and gating system design shall allow flexible configuration (modular design) and is adaptable to the whole range of applications including proton spectroscopy, high resolution anatomical scanning, probing of cerebral blood flow, intrinsic water diffusion, magnetic relaxation, neuronal activation, and other MRI specific parameters. Special temperature regulated water heating system shall be included to maintain animal imaging bed at desired temperature for long periods of time (up to 8 hours).</p>
<p>In vivo, non invasive scanning will be performed to characterize MRI-specific transient and permanent neural responses to different kinds of intervention including chemical and biological compounds in the various subject sizes identified above.</p>
<p>The small animal monitoring and anatomical/physiological gating system shall be used in the development of MRI imaging and informatics techniques for tissue sampling to guide and confirm classical neuropathology, assessment of brain activation network impairment in young Non-Human Primates (NHP) with fMRI and high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its application to in vivo monitoring of neuronal apoptosis.<br /><br />Place of Performance<br />3900 NCTR Road<br />Building 62, Room 108<br />Jefferson, AR 72079</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this request to ensure that, in the event the Government chooses to issue a formal solicitation, every effort will be made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below. As such, responses to this request must be available for unrestricted public distribution. Neither proprietary nor classified concepts or information should be included in any response. The following regulatory guidance applies to this Request for Information (RFI):</p>
<p>FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997)</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI) or to otherwise compensate any interested party for information.</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in Alaska has a requirement for a contractor to video, photograph, map and catalogue geomorphic and biological shore-zone resources at effective mapping scales of better than 1:10,000 for various locations in Alaska specifically, and potentially other coastal areas of the United States.</p>
<p>The objective of this requirement will be to:</p>
<p>1. Collect ShoreZone imagery of the Alaska coastline and potentially other coastlines along the United States,<br />2. Using this low-tide aerial video and still imagery, map the geologic and biological features and enter the data into a georeferenced data base,<br />3. Complete the necessary inventory and mapping needed for a continuous dataset for the entire coastline of Alaska following the methodology described in the paper "ShoreZone Mapping Protocol for the Gulf of Alaska" (August 2008),<br />4. A georeferenced GIS database which includes shoreline geomorphology, substrates, and biological habitats is required as indicated by research and management activities by federal, state, and local agencies and by nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION and TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Respondents are requested to provide information which addresses the vendor's ability to meet the requirements listed below:</p>
<p><br />A. Capability of providing ShoreZone Imagery Collection performed by qualified personnel using state-of-the-art equipment. Contractor shall also be able to meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>FIELD SURVEY PLANNING - A field survey plan is developed for each low-tide window survey. The survey is conducted at the lowest daylight tides of the year with tidal elevations of 0.0 meters or lower. Surveys are only conducted in the summer months from May through August in order to ensure mapping of aquatic vegetation. Operating bases are identified, field survey personnel are identified, logistical helicopter support is arranged (including fuel caches where required) and accommodations for the survey crew are secured. The Field Survey Plan is developed in consultation with the contracting officer representative (COR) and should be reviewed by the COR prior to conducting the survey.</p>
<p>FIELD PERSONNEL - Typically a crew of four individuals are needed in the aircraft including a coastal geomorphologist, a coastal biologist, an in-flight navigator, and a pilot. When surveys necessitate using a smaller helicopter (such as a Robinson R-44) which only holds three persons plus necessary equipment, the geomorphologist or biologist may also do the duties of the navigator. The coastal geomorphologist is responsible for designing the survey, operating the video camera, and collecting the video imagery to sufficient resolution for ShoreZone mapping system. The coastal geomorphologist provides a continuous audio commentary on the geomorphology including specifics on the substrate character that may not be visible on the videography. The coastal biologist is responsible for working with the geologist to design the survey, operating the still-image camera, and shooting still imagery to sufficient resolution for ShoreZone mapping. The coastal biologist provides a continuous audio commentary on the intertidal biota with emphasis on the biological attributes and biobands used in the ShoreZone mapping system. An in-flight navigator is responsible for ensuring that aerial survey coverage is complete, and that the electronic navigation system is recording on second navigation fixes.</p>
<p>FIELD DATA PRODUCTS - The primary products originating from the field program are listed below. As technology changes, data formats change and the suggested specification below are minimum standards.</p>
<p>NAVIGATION DATA FILES - provide location of the survey information on second fix marks with associated latitude, longitude of each fix (to four decimal places) and global positioning system (GPS) clock time. The fixes should be collected to differentially corrected global positioning system (DGPS) standards (horizontal positioning accuracy typically +/- 5m).</p>
<p>VIDEOGRAPHY - low-tide, oblique aerial video imagery. Record videography on media that measures at least 530 lines per inch (LPI) resolution with GPS fix (lat/long) and time burned to each image. In 2006, imagery was recorded on miniDV tapes, which meets this standard, but technology is changing. Filming in HD and recording directly to digital video cards may be viable upgrades if previous standards are maintained at a minimum. In addition, GPS information is to be attached to metadata in the form of geotags: (eg. EXIF: Latitude 55, 44' 18", Latitude Reference - North latitude; Longitude 160, 0' 51", Longitude Reference - West longitude) and attributed to Alaska ShoreZone program (EXIF copyright: Alaska ShoreZone CC BY 3.0) via metadata. Record synchronous geomorphological narration on the left audio channel and biological narration recorded on the right audio channel. In the past, miniDV original tapes (originals) were used to create a master set of DVDs and then archived. A preferred upgrade would be all imagery placed on portable hard drives.</p>
<p>PHOTOGRAPHY - still photography is collected during the over fights and recorded digitally. Minimum 12 megapixel image quality is required. Other file formats must provide equivalent resolution. Images should frame from above the higher high water line to below the lower low water line levels unless broad, flat habitats preclude this. In these habitats maximize image from center halfway between higher high waterline to below the lower low waterline. Zooms of specific features are occasionally collected. The camera clock is synchronized to the GPS clock so that the exact time of each photo is recorded in the metadata for each image; this ensures that the exact location of each photo is known. Images should be geotagged (eg. EXIF: Latitude 55, 44' 18", Latitude Reference - North latitude; Longitude 160, 0' 51", Longitude Reference - West longitude) and attributed to Alaska ShoreZone program (EXIF copyright: Alaska ShoreZone CC BY 3.0). Photos are transferred to DVD or hard drive (or other storage device) and typically archived by day. On average the target is one photo every three seconds (1,200 photos per hour) or a minimum of 1,000 photos per hour. The number of photos taken per hour varies somewhat with habitat and location.</p>
<p>FLIGHTLINE MANUAL - a flight line manual shall be produced to show the flight path associated with each tape or DVD. The path is shown in reference to standard maps (either NTS topographic maps, NOAA charts or electronic shorelines derived from one of these two shoreline). Locations of all photos are shown on the flight line maps. A log is included with each tape to relate geographic features to flight path times and to photo locations.</p>
<p>SHOREZONE DATA ANALYSIS AND MAPPING REQUIREMENTS<br />ShoreZone mapping and data analysis requires oblique aerial imagery to be converted to repeatable units or classes of data; the data shall include both spatial representation that fixes the information on maps (i.e., a mapping system) and an attribute representation that classifies data into a discrete number of categories (i.e., a classification system). Both geological and biological attributes shall be mapped and classified with quality assurance and quality control (QAQC) procedures throughout the process.</p>
<p>GEOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTE MAPPING<br />The geomorphology mapper reviews the imagery, as well as other existing maps and air photos, and marks the shore units onto an electronic shoreline. A shore unit is the primary mapping unit which delineates locations of uniform sediment texture, geomorphology and wave exposure. Shore units may be represented as line segments, points or polygons. Each shore unit is further characterized by the geologist in terms of a collection of across-shore components. The best shoreline must be used to delineate the shoreline. Where there are large deviations in the digital shoreline, adjustments may be made. This shall be noted in the metadata.</p>
<p>Each shore unit is further characterized by the geologist in terms of a collection of across-shore components. The across-shore components are geomorphic features, such as cliffs, beach berms, tidal flats, with associated texture characteristics. The across-shore component attributes are entered into the database but are not delineated on maps. The components are described in terms of (a) observed forms and substrates (e.g., a cobble berm), (b) a landward to seaward sequence and (c) the tidal zone in which they occur (i.e., supratidal, intertidal or subtidal). Within a unit, there may be primary, secondary or tertiary components. The Component data is searchable for particular features (e.g., dunes, pebble beach berms, intertidal structures, mudflats greater than 100m in width).</p>
<p>BIOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTE MAPPING<br />The biota is characterized by a biologist in terms of recognizable and repeatable biotic assemblages that are called biobands. Biobands are attached, epibenthic species, both plants and animals, that are living in the intertidal zone, usually at characteristic across-shore elevations. In most cases, the biobands are named by a single indicator species (e.g., &lsquo;Zostera' bioband) but in some cases a characteristic colour/texture descriptor is used for a combination of indicator species (e.g., the &lsquo;Dark-Brown Kelps' bioband that includes the lower intertidal, chocolate brown, stalked kelps). All of the biobands represent assemblages of biota and are not intended to indicate the occurrence of a single indicator species.</p>
<p>Each bioband is classified as absent (not observed in the unit), patchy (occurs within less than 50% of the unit) or continuous (occurs within more than 50% of the unit); biobands are nested within across-shore components. The bioband data are searchable and linked to both Unit and Component data.</p>
<p>SHORE STATION GROUND SURVEYS - Shore Station ground surveys provide the opportunity for close-up observations of species and substrates identified during aerial observations and therefore the opportunity to clarify the assumptions made regarding the characteristics of the coastal biobands and geologic substrate during aerial observations. The primary objectives of the shore stations investigations are to (1) obtain specific site information to enhance our knowledge and understanding of mapping classifications in a given area; (2) conduct detailed, site specific observations of substrate, morphology and biota at selected shore locations to better understand coastal processes and ecology; (3) collect detailed physical and biological measurements; (4) collect information on species assemblages to complement the aerial perspective of biobands; (5) document regional differences in the biota present in the biobands; and (6) to make this information publically available by adding it to the existing ShoreStation data on-line.</p>
<p>Both geomorphologic and biological information is acquired using the ShoreZone classification definitions provided in the ShoreZone protocol. Across-shore profiles are surveyed for width, elevation, sediment composition, geomorphology, and biota. The data are systematically recorded in Shore Station databases. Field photos are systematically recorded and are linked to the survey notes. Survey profiles are plotted to a common datum. Given sufficient funding the geographic extent of the ground survey should reflect the geographic extent of the aerial survey, should be planned for a similar tide window, and should include each habitat type within the survey area. Sediment samples may be required to be taken at shore stations to archive for hydrocarbon analyses in the event of a local or regional oil spill.</p>
<p>Transects will be conducted using the Emery profiling technique. A transect line is laid out perpendicular to the shoreline to measure beach length and slope with descriptions of biotic and geomorphic features recorded at points along the transect. Across-shore profiles are measured to describe details of the geomorphic features at the shore station. Elevations are measured from the uppermost supratidal zone, from the &lsquo;marine limit', as defined by the edge of terrestrial vegetation, across the shoreline to the waterline. See Figure 1 below. All biological species are recorded in the across-shore components and their relative abundance (e.g. rare, few, common, abundant). Complete photo documentation of the beach is a priority and must be georeferenced at a high-resolution.</p>
<p>Substrate categories recorded at ground stations in ShoreZone are defined according to the standard size classes and nomenclature of the Wentworth scale. Most substrate definitions are for &lsquo;sediment' substrates and defined by the sizes of the particles (or &lsquo;clasts'). The two substrate types found at the bottom of the list are &lsquo;biogenic' and are formed by biological processes. On surveyed transects at the ground station, the substrate observations are recorded for each interval along the across-shore profile. Combinations of multiple substrates are often observed and are listed on the profile in order of relative abundance. Thin layers or veneers of one substrate or more over top of another can also be observed. These veneers are listed as substrates &lsquo;over' substrates (e.g., boulder, cobble over bedrock).</p>
<p>Shore Station data must be presented as a GIS layer. The data base must provide a list of species observed with representative photos. The data base must also have the capability to query the data by region, locale, station, select ShoreZone attributes (habitat class, biobands, etc.), and by species or species groups at a minimum. Data must include fully FGDC compliant metadata files for all ArcGIS feature classes. The ShoreStation datasets shall be combined with the existing datasets and be made accessible to the public on the NMFS website. The contractor shall provide technical support to NMFS for any problems that arise when combining the new datasets with the existing datasets.</p>
<p>Currently the Shore Station database houses over 400 ShoreZone Shore Stations that have been visited since 2002 throughout the Gulf of Alaska (including southeast, Prince William Sound, the outer Kenai Peninsula, Kodiak Island archipelago, Cook Inlet, and the Katmai National Park coast) and in Bering Strait, Kotzebue Sound, the Chukchi Sea and the Beaufort Sea. This online database has been designed to provide easy access to Shore Station data via a query able display of stations at local and regional geographic scales and the ability to download species lists and photos. The ground stations are &lsquo;point features' that are spatially linked to the Alaska ShoreZone web enabled database. New data collection must be compatible with the existing data formats.</p>
<p>OTHER SHOREZONE PRODUCTS - ShoreZone data can be used to generate products that are relevant to ecosystem, habitat, and fisheries management. The high resolution, attribute rich dataset is conducive to habitat modeling. The dataset is suitable for development of habitat capability models for various fish, shellfish and invertebrate species. It has been used to predict habitat use by green crab and pacific herring and it was used for sea cumber management applications. The landscape scale of dataset also makes it a useful tool for extrapolation of site data over broader spatial ranges. The ShoreZone data was used for management of marine debris. Various applications of the ShoreZone data have been developed for oil spill response.</p>
<p>ShoreZone has a public outreach component. NMFS maintains the ShoreZone data online and makes it accessible to the public at no cost. NMFS wants this data to be both physically and intellectually available to the public. Task orders may be issued to provide support for making the data physically and intellectually available to the public.</p>
<p>ShoreZone products requested may include the development of habitat capability/suitability models and extrapolation of the data base for specific purposes. Task orders may include: development of oil spill response tools; requests for training, webinairs, or presentations; development of reference manuals; development of training materials; development of ShoreZone publications, brochures, posters, or other informational materials; providing mounted ShoreZone photos; providing additional written reports and special analyses; copies of datasets; technical support for the full ShoreZone dataset maintained by NMFS; and developing potentially new applications of the ShoreZone dataset.</p>
<p>In some areas of the state, along the Arctic coast, ShoreZone mapping has been done from existing imagery. The contractor researched the available imagery and collected it from the source. Existing imagery may need to be used for other parts of Alaska as well for areas that are too remote or for areas where a permit cannot be acquired for aerial surveys (potentially Saint George and Saint Paul Islands). Future task orders may also include gathering, analyzing, and mapping ShoreZone habitats from existing imagery.</p>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Thermo Electron North America LLC, 1400 Northpoint Pkwy, STE 50, West Palm Beach, FL 33407-1976. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; the size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>The FBI requires an Orbitrap-based accurate-mass LC/MS/MS system with on-the-fly positive ion/negative ion source switching and true MS/MS capability using quadrupole-Orbitrap technology. The upgraded Orbitrap Q Exactive adds the ability to switch between positive and negative modes instantly, and can be done within a single analysis. This technology can be used for almost all aspects of casework requiring chemical analysis, including identification of general unknowns, low-level toxicological analyses, and poisoning investigations.</p>
<p>Thermo Electron North American is the sole patent holder of the developed Orbitrap technology and the only provider of this type of instrument upgrade. Only Thermo Electron North American and their service engineers have complete and direct access to all manufacturer's technical specifications, instrument service manuals, schematics, and copyrighted and proprietary software.<br /><br />Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement can only be provided by Thermo Electron North American, as no other vendor is capable of providing the upgraded Exactive Plus w/HCD to Q Exactive and the proprietary software.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals to this office by 08:00 am, EST, by Friday, April 19, 2013, by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>The awardee shall be registered in the Central Contractor's Database (CCR) and also the Online Representations and Certification (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>

<SUBJECT>RFI - FedRAMP 3PAO Accreditation Body Application
<SOLNBR>RFI-XB-13-002G
<RESPDATE>051513
<CONTACT>Matthew Goodrich, Email 3PAO@FedRAMP.gov - Cynthia D Gilbert
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to invite all prospective Accreditation Bodies to apply to become a FedRAMP 3PAO Accreditation Body in support of the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).
<p>The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a unified government-wide risk management program focused on security for cloud-based systems. FedRAMP provides a standard approach for conducting security assessments of cloud systems based on an accepted set of security controls and consistent processes. Per OMB policy, agencies acquiring cloud services are required to use FedRAMP.</p>
<p>Cloud service providers (CSPs) that go through FedRAMP must use Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) to provide an independent verification and validation (IV&amp;V) of the security implementations required by FedRAMP. FedRAMP provisional authorizations must include an assessment by a FedRAMP accredited 3PAO to ensure a consistent assessment process.</p>
<p>FedRAMP uses a conformity assessment process to accredit 3PAOs. Conformity assessment is a "demonstration that specified requirements relating to a product, process, system, person or body are fulfilled." (Source: ISO/IEC 17000). Conformity assessment is built on a set of internationally recognized standards that help ensure that the program consistently supports the appropriate level of rigor and independence required.</p>
<p>Currently, a government review board is responsible for reviewing the 3PAO applications and providing a recommendation to the FedRAMP Director for a conformity attestation. Similar to other conformity assessment programs, FedRAMP plans to privatize this review process. Under this approach, FedRAMP will approve privatized accreditation bodies to manage the 3PAO application process.</p>
<p>To become a FedRAMP 3PAO Accreditation Body, organizations will have to submit applications that demonstrate that they meet requirements laid out by the FedRAMP PMO. Please refer to the attachment "AB Application_Final.docx" to this announcement for the list of requirements as well as the application to become a FedRAMP 3PAO Accreditation Body.</p>
<p>The accreditation organization(s) that are determined to be the best qualified will be notified that they have been selected as the FedRAMP Approved 3PAO Accreditation Body. All other accreditation organizations will be notified that their requests for FedRAMP Approved 3PAO Accreditation Body status have been denied<br />Applications to become a FedRAMP 3PAO Accreditation Body will be accepted through 5:00pm EST May 15, 2013.&nbsp; FedRAMP PMO will start accepting applications beginning April 15, 2013 at 3PAO@FedRAMP.gov.</p>
<p>All questions and clarifications must be submitted to 3PAO@FedRAMP.gov by 5:00pm EST April 29, 2013. The FedRAMP PMO will publish answers to these questions by 5:00pm EST May 3, 2013.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The award decision is based on evaluation factors that are tailored to the acquisition. Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PRICE FACTOR #2: PAST PERFORMANCE <BR> <BR>The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - the selected offeror must submit a completed copy of the listed representations and certifications; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, paragraph (a) and the following clauses in paragraph (b): 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. <BR> <BR>The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. <BR> <BR>

A thin central inner metallic layer enables hermetic gas tight sealing. At the tube ends a thick metallic wall provides area for end cap welding. The outer fiber reinforced CMC layer provides additional strength to the inner metallic layer and mechanical, environmental and high temperature protection to the inner metallic layer. The novel metal-ceramic tube is potentially seen as a possible containment vessel for nuclear fuel as used in nuclear power plants. The assembled layered tube has an engineered combination of thermal and mechanical features that uniquely result from the combination of metallic and ceramic layers. The inner metallic layer insures hermetic sealing of containment of gases and fuel within the tube and provides for conventional end cap sealing. The outer fiber reinforced ceramic layer imparts additional mechanical strength, stiffness, thermal shock resistance and high temperature load carrying capability above of the inner metallic liner alone. This novel metal-ceramic engineered approach may provide for a potential increase in the lifetime and safety margins as compared to current all zirconium alloy metal fuel tubes.</span></p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<RESPDATE>042913
<CONTACT>John Lee Smithson IV, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone 202-693-9854, Email smithson.john@dol.gov
<DESC>This action is for the purchase of SLRD Self Contained Self Rescuers (SCSR). SCSRs are required for any inspector who goes underground. Under the regulations in 30 CFR Part 75, these units must by MSHA and NIOSH approved units. Working in a coal mine subjects personnel to a harsh environment where the average mine height is approximately 42 inches, there is no light, the surfaces are wet and slippery, and the average temperature is approximately 55 degrees. There is usually only 2 means into or out of the mine. The environment may contain methane and other harmful gasses. In the event of an emergency, the breathing environment may become contaminated with carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide and other noxious gasses. In such emergency situations the MSHA personnel must depend on the Self Contained Self Rescuers for a breathable mixture of air that will permit them adequate time to safely exit the mine.
<p>Moreover, space and weight concerns are of paramount importance to MSHA inspectors. MSHA inspectors frequently need to work in very tight spaces, many of which are less than 30 inches tall. A unit that be securely worn on the belt is very important. In addition, MSHA inspectors need to carry a significant amount of equipment, often weighing as much as 45 pounds. As a result, smaller, lighter equipment lessens the load that inspectors need to carry. This is not just a question of comfort but of safety.</p>

<DESC><p>Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), a&nbsp;National Laboratory and&nbsp;Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) operated by Princeton University under contract to the United States Department of Energy, wishes to solicit proposals for the provision of all labor, material and equipment necessary to perform Phase I research and development, physics and engineering design tasks and diagnostic hall instrumentation development for the ITER Low-Field-Side Reflectometry (LFSR) System in accordance with Statement of Work (SOW) #US ITER 1050302-PD0007-R03, Revision 3, dated&nbsp;April 12, 2013. It is PPPL's intention to include an option in the subcontract for performance of Phase II tasks for fabrication, assembly, test and preparation for shipping to the ITER site in Cadarache, France. Because of the significant technical uncertainties inherent in the design, development and production of millimeter-wave diagnostics equipment such as the LFSR,&nbsp;it is not feasible&nbsp;to perform&nbsp;Phase I of the statement of work using a firm-fixed-price type contractual arrangement. Therefore, PPPL expects to issue either a cost reimbursement (no fee) type subcontract to an academic institution, or a cost-plus-fixed fee type subcontract to a for-profit concern for the Phase I work, depending on the leadership structure of the successful proposal team.&nbsp;The full RFP may be reviewed and downloaded at <a href="http://procurement.pppl.gov">http://procurement.pppl.gov</a>, by clicking on the "Procurement Opportunities" link and then on the appropriate RFP link.&nbsp; PPPL will hold a pre-proposal teleconference at 11:00 AM Eastern Time on Tuesday, April 30, 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pre-proposal teleconference agenda includes an introduction, a briefing on the proposed procurement and the cost proposal submittal requirements, and a question and answer period. Participation in the teleconference is not a prerequisite for proposal submission but is strongly encouraged.&nbsp;Offerors&nbsp;should contact the RFP Coordinator to obtain login instructions for the call.&nbsp;This announcement shall not commit PPPL&nbsp;to issue a subcontract for this effort, or to pay any costs incurred by offerors in the preparation and submittal of proposals in response to this RFP.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<DESC>OMBUDSMAN-NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTEST <br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

Typical transportation of fuel to these sites will include the use of a barge and/or helicopter. Full 125 gallon "pickle barrels" are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the remote site by a helicopter rated for that load. A fuel mechanic removes the barrels from the sling and transfers the propane from the pickle barrels to standard 500 gallon propane tanks. This process is repeated until all tanks are at maximum capacity.

All tanks are to be filled to maximum capacity. Government estimate for fuel amounts should be +/- 10 % for each site, due to the accuracy of the gauges.

Contractor shall perform propane leak checks (soap spray or sniffer) on all propane tanks and fuel lines at NDS remote sites, up to the location where fuel line enters generator hut. Leaks found during these inspections shall be isolated and repaired. In the event of an irreparable leak requiring additional cost to repair, notify the Contracting Officer immediately for action to be taken.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.  In addition to DRM, PS, and OPS, OFDA has a Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Within OFDA, the Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement (HPGE) Team serves as the principal focal point for humanitarian policy development, engagement with UN agencies and other public international organizations, and other donor governments. The HPGE Team tracks trends and policy developments in the humanitarian assistance field; engages in policy discussion with other donors and multilateral agencies.  It recommends strategies for action; initiates policy and internal guidance for the organization; maintains global relationships with OFDA implementing partners and other donors.  The HPGE team leads OFDA's communications work; and serves as the primary interlocutor with OFDA's other federal partners on global issues. The HPGE Team is directed by a Humanitarian Coordination Specialist and is supported by Humanitarian Advisors, an Operations Support Coordinator, and also has staff members focused on program development, policy and outreach, strategic communications, and interagency engagement. The HPGE Team has Senior Humanitarian Advisors located in Rome, Geneva, and Brussels and a Humanitarian Advisor located in New York and Washington.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor (SHA) in Rome is part of the HPGE Team's global policy staff.</p>
<p>Within the U.S. Mission to the United Nations (USUN) in Rome, the USAID Unit serves as the liaison office with the World Food Program (WFP) and the resiliency and emergency-related activities of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  In recent years, approximately 90% of WFP's and one-half of FAO's budgets have been directed to emergency and humanitarian relief operations worldwide, nearly $3 billion and $350 million respectively.

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>2.  ISSUANCE DATE: April 15, 2013</p>
<p>3.  CLOSING DATE/TIME FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: April 29, 2013, 5:00 pm EDT</p>
<p>4.  POSITION TITLE: Crisis Response General Development Officer</p>
<p>5. MARKET VALUE: GS-14 equivalent hourly $40.58 - $52.76 (Equivalent daily rate $324.64-$422.08 - not eligible for locality pay).  Final compensation will be negotiated within the listed market value based upon the candidate's past salary, work history and educational background.  Salaries over and above the top of the pay range will not be entertained or negotiated.</p>
<p>6.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  One (1) year, with four (4) option years</p>
<p>STATEMENTS OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD/PLACE OF PERFORMANCE AND BENEFITS:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services overseas on a temporary, on-call basis as part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) / Office of Civilian Response (OCR) "Firehouse." The Personal Services Contractor(s) hired under this contract will provide up to a maximum of 250 workdays of services on an annual basis.</p>
<p>The specific projects, as well as dates, number of days and locations to be worked will be determined by mutual agreement between the contractor and his/her OCR supervisor according to requests made to OCR by USAID overseas missions. This is an intermittent USPSC solicitation. There is no obligation by OCR to provide assignments for a minimum number of days, and the contractor will be free to provide "blackout" dates during which he/she will not be available to accept assignments.</p>
<p>Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, OCR will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>
<p>1.    Date contractor is needed to report to OCR or assignment in the field<br />2.    Duration of Assignment<br />3.    Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify OCR whether he/she is available for the assignment within two business days. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a crisis may require the assignment to be curtailed or extended (not to exceed 250 days per year). The contractor shall notify OCR at the time of commitment if his or her existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment, but will simply assist OCR in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if unforeseen circumstances arise, and the contractor needs to curtail the assignment and leave post, the contractor must receive approval from OCR and the Mission prior to departure.</p>
<p>As services provided by the contractor are on a temporary, on-call basis, health and life insurance reimbursements will be provided on a prorated basis based on the number of days during which the contractor actually provides services.</p>
<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Worldwide<br /> <br />There may be an initial orientation and training program in Washington, D.C. This may include formal classroom training, online training, on-the-job training and security training. After completion of appropriate training, the Crisis Response General Development Officer will be considered available for overseas assignment.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Civilian Response (OCR) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support USAID missions abroad when faced with a natural disaster, political crisis, and internal conflict or otherwise in need of staff support due to some unforeseen circumstance. Created in 2008, OCR provides crisis staffing to USAID missions throughout the world with a full range of specialized expertise.  Since then this office has provided over 20,000 days of mission support in deployments to countries such as Libya, Tunisia, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, Burma, Honduras, Jamaica, Kenya, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of  Congo as well as many other countries. As a member of OCR's team of crisis responders you would be available at short notice to bring to USAID missions your specialized skills in support of a mission's response to a crisis.   <br /> <br />USAID is striving to become an even more nimble and agile organization when responding to crises.  Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a crisis or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot always be fully addressed by a traditional USAID mission staffing. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed state. OCR plays a unique role in USAID by ensuring the USAID mission has sufficient staff with the right skills during those critical golden hours.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet USAID mission needs OCR retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are available to missions to expand their capacity, augment their existing capability, fill in gaps, and replace evacuated staff or in some cases project USAID presence to field sites or non-presence countries. OCR staff provide specialized skills in a range of areas from contracting to communications, to program design, election monitoring, project management, development outreach and communication, reporting and strategic planning among others. As a member of this team you would play a crucial role in supporting USAID programs at a time when their success is most critical.</p>
<p>The OCR "Firehouse" comprises USPSCs on intermittent contracts providing support when changed circumstances in a country necessitate an increase in staffing or additional specialized skills. Those serving in the Firehouse must be prepared to work abroad in USAID missions and embassies, often with little time for preparations.  Deployments may be for any period of time from 2 months to almost a full year.</p>
<p>USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>

<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>
<p>(1) The solicitation number;</p>
<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>
<p>(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;</p>
<p>(5) Terms of any express warranty;</p>
<p>(6) Price and any discount terms;</p>
<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>

<p>(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;</p>
<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>

<p>(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation.

<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; (<br />ii) price;<br />(iii) past performance (see FAR 15.304);</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are Approximately equal to cost or price</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p><br />WAWF<br />EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT<br /><br />(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.) This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment. <br /><br />(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process<br /><br />Acceptor: The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the purchase request) who accepts the products or services tendered. The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.<br /><br />DoDAAC: As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code. This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense. Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.<br /><br />Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices. The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.<br /><br />(c) Options within WAWF include a "combo" for supply items, a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a "stand-alone" invoice. It is recommended that the use of, stand-alone invoices be avoided. The matching of "stand-alone" invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified. The use of the "combo" or "2-in-1" does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching. Detailed instructions on how to create an invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website at http://www.wawftraining.com .<br /><br />(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the "Send More E-Mail Notifications" link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in1). This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice<br /><br />Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html . For assistance in registering contact:<br />1-866-618-5988<br />COMMERCIAL: 801-605-7095<br />CSCASSIG@CSD.DISA.MIL <br /><br />Helpful training on the use of WAWF for the submission of invoices is available on line at http://www.wawftraining.com.</p>

This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks. Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground. Delays caused by any adverse employee information do not constitute a basis for claim by the Contractor. It is the Contractor?s responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds. <BR> <BR>(a) In accordance with Section 326 of P.L. 102-484, the Government is prohibited from awarding any contract which includes a specification or standard that requires the use of a Class I ozone-depleting substance (ODS) identified in Section 602(a) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 767a(a)), or that can be met only through the use of such a substance unless such use has been approved, on an individual basis, by a senior acquisition official who determines that there is no suitable substitute available. (b) To comply with this statute, the Government has conducted a best efforts screening of the specifications and standards associated with this acquisition to determine whether they contain any ODS requirements. To the extent that ODS requirements were revealed by this review, they are identified in Section C or the statement of work of this document. (c) If offerors possess any special knowledge about any other ODS required directly or indirectly at any level of contract performance, the U.S. Army would appreciated if such information was surfaced to the Contracting Officer for appropriate action. To preclude delay to the procurement, offerors should provide any information as soon as possible after release of the solicitation and prior to the submission of offers to the extent practicable. It should be understood that there is no obligation on offerors to comply with this request and that no compensation can be provided for doing so. <BR> <BR>Manufacturer or supplier must ensure that all OSHA standards applicable to that which is being purchased are complied with. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolutions forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile Number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FEDEX or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft.

The main gate is approximately 90 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah. Contractors may be required to travel up to 150 miles one way from Salt Lake City to reach some work sites. <BR> <BR>Contractors with valid U.S. government contracts will be allowed to hire non U.S. citizens to work at or visit U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) during performance of the contract. Contractor?s shall adhere to the following process. A list of foreign national employees shall be provided to the DPG Counterintelligence, Law Enforcement, and Security Offices at least five (5) working days prior to arrival on post.

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.  Multiple awards will not be made; therefore, quotes that cover less than all the items and quantities in this solicitation will be rejected as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>New equipment/parts only.  No remanufactured products. <BR> <BR>In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Technical acceptability will be based on the demonstrated ability to meet the technical requirements, including the delivery requirement. A mere statement that the vendor "will meet the Government's requirements" is insufficient; the vendor must demonstrate how it will meet the requirement.</span></p>

<DESC><p>Purpose: The purpose of this notice is to invite interested roofing contractors to a Pre-Proposal Conference in conjunction with the anticipated release of the draft Request For Proposal (dRFP).<br /><br />The Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is transforming the way the U.S. Air Force purchases its roofing repair and replacement needs. The ESG will move the Air Force to a regional contract model representing approximately $325 million in total roofing requirements over five years. This will represent a significant change in roofing acquisition for both the Air Force and roofing contractors.</p>
<p>As part of an ongoing effort to more efficiently procure roofing for the Air Force, the ESG is preparing to solicit a targeted number of multiple award, regional indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ)-type contracts covering Air Force bases located in the contiguous U.S. This approach is a transformational shift from traditional base-specific contracts to a more strategic approach designed to address ongoing budget and manpower challenges.<br /><br />In conjunction with anticipated release of the draft Request for Proposal, the ESG will be hosting a Pre-Proposal Conference to communicate the preliminary contract requirements that will be contained in the dRFP and to obtain input from interested roofing contractors. The Conference will be offered both in-person as well as broadcast over the Internet for those unable to travel (see registration links below). There will be no conference fee to participate. Proposed discussion topics for the event include:</p>
<p>&bull; Overview of Strategic Sourcing<br />&bull; Role of Small Business and Teaming Arrangements<br />&bull; Overview of the Air Force Roofing Strategy &amp; Objectives<br />&bull; Review of the draft RFP<br /><br />Interested contractors are invited to participate in this Conference in order to learn about this upcoming business opportunity and provide feedback to the Air Force. Additionally, this event will provide an opportunity for contractors to network with potential teaming partners and/or subcontractors.<br /><br />It is the intention of the ESG to release the dRFP by the end of March 2013 which will be posted to FBO as a modification to this Special Notice.</p>
<p>Details of the Pre-Proposal Conference are as follows:</p>
<p>Date: Wednesday, 17 April 2013<br />Duration: 1 Day (approximately 8am-5pm EDT)<br />Location: <br />Kenney Hall<br />Air Force Institute of Technology<br />2950 Hobson Way<br />Bldg 642, Area B<br />Wright Patterson AFB<br />Dayton, OH</p>
<p>Please note that the date and location may be subject to change in the event of Sequestration or other unforeseen delays, and the Government cannot be held liable for any costs incurred by you or your company should there be any unforeseen changes to the event. Attendance at the Pre-Proposal Conference, while encouraged, is completely voluntary.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Registration:<br /></span></strong>All attendees, both in-person and internet viewers, must register by clicking ONE of the links below. Please note that identifying information will be required to register, so we advise waiting to register until all company attendees are finalized.<br /><br /><strong>In-person Registration</strong>:<br /><br /><strong>REGISTRATION FOR IN-PERSON ATTENDANCE AT THIS EVENT HAS CLOSED <br /></strong><br />ALL IN-PERSON ATTENDEES ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER IN ADVANCE. NO INDIVIDUALS WILL BE GRANTED BASE ACCESS WITHOUT PRIOR REGISTRATION. THE FINAL DATE TO REGISTER IS APRIL 8, 2013 by 4:00pm EDT.<br /><br /><strong>Internet-only Registration: <br /></strong></p>

<DESC>The following is a clarification to Item 5 in the Instructions for the Technical Proposal: <br>  <br> The intent of Item 5 is to provide justification for the potential of notional engine/power system concept(s) and key component/subsystem level technologies that will be analyzed in the proposed effort to meet the program objectives. Defining a set of alternative concepts/technologies to explore as part of this effort and justification of their potential to address program objectives will demonstrate the offeror's understanding of the concepts sought under this effort. This ensures the Government that an offeror is not simply proposing a literature search that includes non-promising technologies that would be a waste of Government resources. <br>  <br> Therefore, in Item 5, both occurrences of  ''engine/power system concept'' should be changed to ''engine/power system concept(s)''. <br>  <br> Also, proposals are now due May 6, 2013 by 2:00 P.M., E.D.T. <br>  <br> All other information in the BAA remains unchanged. <br>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541380 - Testing Laboratories; annual receipts or $14.0M. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p><strong>Background.</strong> This procurement is entitled Genotyping of M. Tubercuosis Isolates. Genotyping (also referred to as DNA fingerprinting) of M. tuberculosis isolates using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with the insertion sequence IS6110 was introduced in 1990. Application of this technique to outbreaks investigated by the Division of Tuberculosis Elimination demonstrated the utility of strain typing for support of epidemiologic investigations and suggested this technology should be available to TB control programs nationwide. Because of the complexity of the technique and the limited number of isolates to be typed, it was decided that implementation in a small number of regional laboratories would be most efficient, which began in 1992. To further assess the utility of large scale typing, the National Tuberculosis Genotyping and Surveillance Network (NTGSN) was established in 1996. NTGSN included seven Sentinel Surveillance Sites and seven Regional DNA Fingerprinting Laboratories (hereinafter refered to as Regional Laboratories). The NTGSN conducted a prospective study of fingerprinting of isolates in the seven surveillance sites during calendar years 1996-2000. During this period, the Regional Laboratories provided genotyping services to their assigned regions in addition to performing genotyping of isolates from the Sentinel Surveillance Sites. The results of the NTGSN project confirmed the utility of universal, prospective genotyping for TB control and support the establishment of universal genotyping in the US. The project also highlighted limitations of the standard IS6110 RFLP method, including the slow turnaround time for results, high cost, limited throughput, and difficulties in analysis of complex fingerprint patterns.</p>
<p>To overcome these difficulties, newer, rapid methods have been introduced for primary genotyping. Spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR are PCR based typing methods that require minimal amounts of culture material, are conducive to high throughput analysis, have a fast turnaround time and provide a high level of discrimination. These methods have been used to provide universal genotyping services in the US. The National TB Genotyping Service consists of two laboratories which were selected by a competitive process in response to a request for proposal. The first contract provided for the genotyping of up to 5,000 isolates per year per laboratory during the time period September 2003 - September 2008 and a second contract continued the support of genotyping for the time period September 2008 - September 2013. As of January 2013, over 70,000 isolates have been submitted to these laboratories by TB control programs for genotyping. For those clusters of isolates that require further discrimination, the standard IS6110-RFLP method is available upon request as a secondary typing method. The service has been shown to be useful to the TB control programs by identifying numerous previously unidentified outbreaks, by defining limits of suspected outbreaks, and by detecting instances of false positive cultures.</p>
<p>The TB Genotyping Information Management System (TB GIMS) is a web based system developed by CDC to provide TB control programs with tools to manage and analyze genotyping data as well as to integrate genotyping information with the National TB Surveillance System. Submission of isolates for genotyping is now one of the TB Indicators used to evaluate TB control programs.<br />Purpose and Objectives. The purpose of this contract is to establish regional laboratories to provide genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in support of state and local tuberculosis (TB) control programs within the United States and research activities of the CDC Division of Tuberculosis Elimination (DTBE) and the Tuberculosis Epidemiologic Studies Consortium (TBESC). The goal will be to provide genotyping for one isolate from each newly diagnosed, culture-positive case of TB in the US.</p>
<p><strong>Project requirements.</strong> Scope of Work:<br /><br />The contractor shall, as an independent organization and not as an agent of the United States Government, furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities to perform the services required in the contract, except for equipment specifically listed in the statement of work as provided by CDC.</p>
<p>Technical Requriements. The contractor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1.0/ Communication: Communicate with public health laboratories and TB control programs in their assigned region via telephone, fax, and e-mail, to allow prior notice of shipment of cultures, confirmation of receipt of cultures, transmittal of results, and consultation on shipments. Provide physical security measures for maintenance of confidentiality of patient data.</p>
<p>Task 2.0/Submissions: Provide input on CDC established protocols at protocol discussion meeting for the submission of isolates for genotyping from submitting laboratories which include prior notification of shipment to contractor, submission form, proper containers and labeling, and enforce these protocols by rejecting any improperly prepared submission and providing consultation on proper submissions to submitting laboratory.</p>
<p>Task 3.0/Process submitted samples for genotyping: The following subtasks shall be completed by the contractor:</p>
<p>Subtask 3.1/Frozen stocks: Receive and log M. tuberculosis isolates for genotyping. Prepare two subcultures of each isolate. One subculture (0.5 mL) will be transferred to CDC no later than 90 calendar days after receipt of isolate. Maintain frozen subcultures (-70C) and a computerized inventory of isolates for duration of contract. Frozen subcultures shall be destroyed at conclusion of contract. The shipment of M. tuberculosis cultures must comply with all regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation for the shipment of Category A Infectious Substances (www.dot.gov). Shipping charges and containers will be the responsibility of the contractor.</p>
<p>Subtask 3.2/DNA Preparations: Prepare small scale DNA samples for rapid PCR-based assays. Retain frozen DNA samples (-20C) and maintain a computerized inventory. An aliquot (0.05 mL) will be transferred to CDC no later than five (5) days after receipt of isolate. Frozen samples will be maintained for five (5) years from the date of receipt of the corresponding isolates and will be transferred to CDC, if requested. All DNA samples will be transferred to CDC at the contract completion; shipping charges will be the responsibility of the contractor. DNA samples shall be prepared using the CDC protocol. Alternative protocols may be submitted to CDC along with validation of the protocol to provide DNA of sufficient quality for the spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR (subtask 3.4) assays.</p>
<p>Subtask 3.3/MIRU-VNTR: Perform mycobacterium interspersed repetitive unit-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) typing by amplification of MIRU loci by PCR followed by automated analysis on a capillary electrophoresis sequencing instrument (references attached). MIRU-VNTR analysis shall be conducted using the CDC protocol. Alternative protocols may be submitted to CDC along with validation of the protocol. Analyze data using CDC provided Microsoft Excel spreadsheets; confirm results with visual inspection of data. Training for all methods will be provided by CDC. No reagents will be provided by CDC.</p>
<p>Subtask 3.4/Reports: Prepare and upload genotyping reports to TB GIMS by importing results from excel spreadsheets into a CDC provided Microsoft Access database. Training for all methods will be provided by CDC. Contractor shall upload MIRU-VNTR result to TB GIMS no later than 15 days of receipt of isolate.</p>
<p>Task 4.0/IS6110 typing: Prepare purified DNA samples for IS6110 RFLP analysis and perform IS6110 typing by standard agarose gel electrophoresis, blotting, and hybridization methods on requested isolates. IS6110 typing will be performed as needed only after the results of the PCR-based typing are obtained and will only be performed on those isolates belonging to a PCR cluster in that jurisdiction. The decision to IS6110 type will be based on request by the relevant TB control program or by request of CDC. It is anticipated that less than 10% of submitted isolates will require IS6110 typing. IS6110 typing will be completed and results reported to the requesting program within 45 working days after the decision is made to perform typing. Contractor shall analyze results of IS6110 typing by pattern matching using computer software (Bionumerics). Patterns will only be compared to the patterns of those isolates belonging to the same PCR genotype cluster as defined by spoligotype and MIRU-VNTR pattern. Image files of specific IS6110 fingerprint patterns will be submitted to CDC when requested via e-mail. Training in these methods will not be provided by CDC. CDC will provide IS6110 marker.</p>
<p>Task 5.0/Data review: Provide to the CDC project officer copies of the output data files and the excel files from MIRU-VNTR and the genotyping Microsoft Access database on a monthly basis. All data should be stored on CD-ROM and be made to reach the CDC no later than 10 days after the end of the month. After review of data, repeat typing of any isolate will be at the discretion of the CDC Project Officer.</p>
<p>Task 6.0/Quality Assurance:</p>
<p>Subtask 6.1/Contractor's Quality Control Plan (QCP): The contractor will be required to provide a QCP. At a minimum, this program shall consist of retyping 3% of isolates each month. The contractor will provide CDC with a report of the QCP results including a description and resolution of discrepant results within 30 days of the end of the month.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT NO. 1:  See attached Amendment No. 1 for Questions and Answers and changes to the original RFO solicitation.
*
*


The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Western Service Area, Western-Pacific Region, AAQ-530, has a requirement for Janitorial Services for the FAAs new Air Traffic Control Tower and Base Building at the Oakland Intl Airport in Oakland, CA.

This is a new facility that was constructed with the goal of achieving LEED Gold certification.  All janitorial services will conform to the strictest LEED requirements.  The contractor must have as a member of their permanent management staff a full time employee who is LEED certified as an Accredited Professional (AP) in the area of Operations and Maintenance.  The LEED certified AP must be directly responsible to any resulting contract and be available and responsible to the FAAs questions and concerns at all times.  Interested janitorial firms must have at least 3-years experience in janitorial services with at least 1-year experience with a LEED certified facility.  Experience must include service to other government facilities or large size companies.  

Interested firms must have an office within 50-miles of the facility.  This office must be maintained during the entire life of the contract.  Map Quest will be used to determine the distance.  A Post Office Box address will not be accepted.  See the attached RFO and Statement of Work for complete requirements.

This procurement is set-aside as a Tiered Evaluation type solicitation.  
  1.	 A tiered evaluation of offers will be used in the source selection of this procurement, and offers from other than small business concerns will only be considered after the determination that an insufficient number of offers from responsible small business concerns have been received.  There must be at least 2-responsive, qualified and responsible offers in any tier for competition to exist in that tier.  
  2.	Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing the FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.
  3.	Tiered evaluation of offers is used to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR/RFO.  Therefore, all size business concerns are invited to respond to this solicitation.
  4.	The CO must consider the tiers of small business concerns prior to evaluating offers from other than small business concerns.  The tiered order of precedence for this solicitation (descending in order) is as follows:
     a.	Socially and economically disadvantaged business (SEDB) expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in SBAs 8(a) program.
     b.	Service-disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB).
     c.	Very small business.
     d.	Small business.
     e.	Other than small business.
  5.	Once offers are received, the CO will evaluate a single tier of offers according to the order of precedence specified above.  If no award can be made at the first tier, the evaluation will proceed to the next tier until an award can be made.
Results from our Market Research indicate that there are very few small businesses that are interested and qualified in accordance with the project Statement of Work.  Therefore, other than small businesses are encouraged to participate in this solicitation.

The FAA anticipates awarding a Firm-Fixed-Price contract.  The period of performance is expected to start on May 1, 2013 and end on September 30, 2013 (5-month base period) with four, 1-year options.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is: 561720 Janitorial Services, size standard $16.5 million.  The FAA will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of your offer.

Offerors must attend a mandatory job walk on either April 9, 2013 or April 16, 2013.  Offers are due no later than 1:00 PM PDT on April 22, 2013, unless changed by RFO Amendment.  See RFO Section L for complete submittal instruction.

This notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises:  The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.  Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing.  The maximum line of credit is $750,000.  For further information and applicable forms concerning STLP, call the OSDBU at (800) 532-1169.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, MD is seeking potential sources capable of providing an airborne Full-Motion Video (FMV) Airborne Data Link System for the MH-60S aircraft. The FMV system is required to transmit forward-looking infrared video from the aircrafts Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS) to both ship board systems and special operations forces. The system must also have the capability to simultaneously receive FMV data from an off-board source while transmitting to a user, potentially on a different frequency band.
<p>The FMV system shall consist of a rack mountable Common Data Link (CDL) modem, Radio Frequency Equipment (RFE), and Windows XP-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) software. A proven non-developmental item is preferred due to rapid development and deployment schedule. The system shall meet NAVAIR flight worthiness requirements, require no additional cooling, and be powered by 28 Volts DC. The system will be integrated and installed in the aircraft by the Government. The FMV system shall be interoperable with all CDL Remote Viewing Terminals (RVT) systems, Common Data Link (CDL) systems, Predator systems, and any other system that utilizes the CDL, Tactical, BD455, and BD466ER waveforms. The system shall be capable of transmitting and receiving over L-band, S-band, C-band, and Ku-band both encrypted (National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 via KGV-135A, Advanced Encryption Standard(AES), and Double Encryption Standard(DES) and unencrypted with data rates up to 45 Mbps.

<DESC>** The purpose of this amendment is to extend the response date to: Monday April 15, 2013 04:00 PM PST**

This announcement constitutes an RFI notice for planning purposes.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP).  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.
Air Combat Electronics (PMA 209), in support of the Director, Air Warfare (N98), is surveying industry for capabilities to provide an encrypted Aircraft Wireless Internal Communication System (AWICS) that can meet the requirements of air and ground crew members performing duties in the back of the aircraft, while dismounted from the aircraft, and during hoist and other normal aircraft operations.  PMA 209 will use the RFI respondents information to formulate acquisition approaches and plan for appropriate future investments.
 

AWICS was established to eliminate the entanglement hazards posed by the Internal Communications System (ICS) long cord component currently used by air and ground crew members on rotary wing, tilt rotor, and fixed wing aircraft.  Incorporation of this wireless technology will enable safer communication between air and ground crew members during all phases of ground and flight operations.  The Navys (on behalf of Naval Aviation: Navy and Marine Corps) principal requirement is to eliminate the long cord entanglement hazard.

The government encourages industry to respond to this RFI even if your system does not meet all of the current AWICS requirements, as the responses will assist the finalization of the requirements generation process.
  Therefore, there is a possibility that not all desired performance characteristics stated herein will be included in the potential AWICS solution. 

CONTENT OF RFI RESPONSE
To consider the appropriateness of each candidate solution, certain data documenting the technology, design, performance characteristics and associated costs are desired.  Please describe your product and its current state of maturity and address the questions on the following pages where possible. 
Although some specific questions may not be applicable to your system, please address each item as listed to the extent practicable.  Further, should your proposed system not meet the desired requirements, please address if you could conceptually meet the threshold requirement levels provided and if so, how you would accomplish this, to include cost and schedule data.
  The configuration of a proposed solution does not necessarily need to be the final end-state configuration (i.e., proposed solutions may be improved over time).
In addition to the specific requested data on the candidate systems, any substantiating supplemental background, comparative analysis or trade studies that can be provided to evaluate the system will greatly improve the understanding of the submission.

The Rockaway Inlet Federal Navigation Channel is scheduled to be dredged to a depth of 20 feet plus 2 feet allowable over-depth or deeper based on the availability of material. The material dredged from the Inlets will be place along the Rockaway Beaches, approximately between Beach 19th Street and Beach 149th Street. The proposed work can be performed by either a pipeline or hopper dredge with pump-out capacity and an ability to withstand open ocean conditions. <br /><br />The apparent low bidder shall be officially notified by the contracting officer to submit the following information: a) name, location, point of contact, b) evidence of the daily production capability and the output rates of at least 12,500 cubic yards per day for their proposed integrated system of dredging and placement. In addition, a synopsis (narrative detailing the operation to move the dredged material from the dredging site to its final resting place) of the proposed operation is also to be submitted by the apparent low bidder. Bidders should consult with Section 00 80 00 paragraph 1A.1 of the Specifications for detailed submittal requirements. <br /><br />The Contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt by him of the notice to proceed, to prosecute said work diligently and to complete the basic work ready for use not later than one hundred and sixty (160) calendar days after the receipt by him of the notice to proceed. It is anticipated that dredging and disposal would take place within the approximate time period of March 2013 through August 2013. The work is estimated to cost over $15,000,000. Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about 15 April 2013 with bid opening on/about 15 May 2013. <br /><br />Large business concerns must submit as part of their bid a subcontracting plan for this project in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-8 and FAR Clause 52.219-9. Failure to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan may make the bidder ineligible for award of the contract. Small Business Goals: If a large business, the prime contractor shall provide its small business subcontracting plan conforming to the requirements of FAR 19.704 and DFARS 219.7. The small business subcontracting goals for USACE New York District are as follows: Small Business 50.0%, Small Disadvantaged Business 17.0%, Women-Owned Small Business 18.0%, HubZone Small Business 10.0%, Veteran Owned Small Business 4.0% and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 4.0%. A subcontracting plan reflecting goals less than indicated, shall provide, as part of the subcontracting plan submission, those extenuating circumstances of why the goal cannot be met. You may contact the District, Deputy of Small Business or your local SBA for assistance. A contract will not be awarded until the Contracting Officer has determined that the subcontracting plan provides maximum practicable opportunities for Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, HubZone Small Business and Women-Owned Small Business program concerns to participate in contract performance. <br /><br />The media selected for issuance of Synopsis/Solicitation and amendments shall solely be at the discretion of the Government; accordingly, the media utilized for this project shall be the internet.

Questions not received within a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered.*** <BR> <BR>For this solicitation, VHA NCO 01 - 405 - White River Jct, VT intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc. FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 01 - 405 - White River Jct, VT is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.    (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.    (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions. <BR> <BR>(d) Section II, Installation.

Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).    (e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.    (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>Contract No. P13PX00704 TAS: 14 1036
In accordance with FAR 6.305 and FAR 5.406, this special notice publishes the Justification and Approvals for Other than Full and Open Competition. This is not a request for competitive proposals, bids, or quotes. The Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement (14 days from posting date). A solicitation is not available. Please email the Contract Specialist, Christie VandenDries, at christie_vandendries@nps.gov with responses or questions regarding the requirement. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIREMENT The purpose of this purchase order is to provide the National Park Service (NPS), Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve (YUCH), with text editing, wayside design, and production ready files for the fabrication of the panels and bases for twenty original wayside panels of various sizes, two bulletin boards, two wooden building identification signs, and various types of bases and mounts.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION In September 2011, J&J Architectural was awarded a task order under a Harper Ferry's IDIQ contract to design and fabricate 20 wayside panels for Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve. That task order was eventually terminated for default. Their subcontractor for graphic design of the panels was Gecko Group. The design of the panels was completed prior to termination of the contract; however, NPS has not been successful in obtaining the production ready files from J&J to use in fabrication of the panels. Gecko Group received partial payment for their work but is still owed $12,937.25 by J&J. Gecko Group has agreed to provide NPS with the production files for half of the remaining funds due to them. 
EFFORTS TO LOCATE OTHER SOURCES Awarding this contract to Gecko Group will save the government significant funds because they will purchase existing design files for a fraction of what it would cost to redesign the panels or reproduce those files. In addition, significant staff time that would be needed to edit and proof each panel would be saved.

<DESC>The knowledge required to conduct the aforementioned evaluation and other tasks is specialized and concerns areas of medical expertise that is well beyond the scope of Defense Counsel's understanding. In this case, only one contractor is capable of meeting the unique skill set required to defend the accused.  Market research supports other than full and open competition (sole source) for this requirement. Due to the highly specialized area of expertise and the sensitive nature of a Courts-Martial Trial, a limited amount of individuals are capable of providing the anticipated service. Based on the market research and guidance from the USARAK Legal Team, the vendor is the most qualified and capable source to provide this service. His medical expertise and knowledge of forensic science make him the only source capable of providing the accused a proper defense in this Courts-Martial Trial.  IAW FAR 6.302-3, Full and open competition need not to be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to acquire the services of an expert or neutral person for any current or anticipated litigation or dispute. Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by the written justification and approval described in FAR 6.303 and FAR 6.304.

<DESC>See attached JEFO: This task order is issued under the U.S. Department of Treasury, Application Support Services indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract (TOS11D0001) to modify and upgrade Treasury's Information Executive Repository (TIER) and CFO Vision (CFOV) to comply with the Government wide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted Trial Balance System (GTAS) reporting requirements mandated by Financial Management Service (FMS).
<p>This task order is a logical follow-on to be completed by CyberData-IDL, which was competitively awarded the O&amp;M task (subCLIN 002-1). There is an inherent risk if another contractor was responsible for modifying the applications maintained by Cyberdata-IDL. Since this requirement is integrally related to subCLIN 002-1, which was competitively awarded to CyberData-IDL Solutions for the O&amp;M contract. As a result, only the Cyberdata-IDL personnel have unique expertise with the applications and staffing for the specified task. A new contractor would not only need to become familiar with these custom O&amp;M application portfolios, but also maintain the current framework and internal procedures to avoid an error, which would negatively impact the O&amp;M task. Since this task is modifying and upgrading a portfolio of applications that is currently being maintained via subCLIN 002-1 only Cyberdata-IDL is capable of performing this task. <br /><br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.</p>

<DESC>The HHS-IHS has a requirement for the purchase of an Electronic Dental Record (EDR) System. The IHS-DOH utilizes the Dentrix Enterprise Electronic Dental Record (EDR)System which was acquired in the above mentioned contract to manage dental services and history to over 1.6 million American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) in more than 300 IHS hospitals and health centers. Henry Schein Inc. has developed a modified EDR system from the existing Dentrix Enterprise product line to meet the needs of IHS-DOH. The Dentrix Enterprise product is an EDR system and infrastructure which provides complete clinical and practice management office automation, central control, scalability and high level security. The Dentrix Enterprise product currently being used was specifically designed to interface with the existing IHS health information system to provide an integrated electronic dental patient record and to support the seamless nationwide implementation from one site to the next. The Dentrix Enterprise EDR software is the only software that meets the IHS DOH technical and functional requirements and integrates with the IHS legacy system. On March 4, 2013 Henry Schein Inc. and SAIC entered into a Government Teaming Agreement in which SAIC was granted exclusive rights to the Dentrix Enterprise product utilized at IHS. SAIC shall serve as the Prime Contractor and provide the software through negotiations with Henry Schein Inc. This requirement is a Firm Fixed Price, Time and Material hybrid.
