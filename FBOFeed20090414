Background:   The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office of Justice Services, Operations Division through an internal evaluation of law enforcement programs, has noted a safety issue regarding the handling of items saturated with blood and body fluids. Currently, our law enforcement agencies are handling items of biological evidence without the proper equipment; this has the potential for high liability to our agency by exposing our employees to biohazards. The proper handling of biological evidence is an issue that needs to be addressed immediately. More specifically, the drying of bloody clothing associated with crimes, which is necessary prior to lab evaluation and storage of that type of evidence. In addition, if saturated evidence is not dried properly it inhibits the growth of mold, in turn destroying evidentiary value. The current process of hanging these items out in the open air is primitive and exposes employees to putrid vapors as well as potentially hazardous blood and body fluids      
Scope of Work:  The vendor will manufacture biological evidence drying cabinets to the specifications and dimensions to meet the needs of our agency. The vendor will deliver the units to specific agency locations throughout the United States. The locations will include, but not limited to:

The proposed procurement contains an option to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the government.

Pursuant to 38 U S C 8127 ( c ) of Public Law 109-461 and the provisionsof Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Acquisition and MaterialManagement (O&MM) Information Letter 049-07-08, the VA Medical Center,Erie, PA intends to award a service disabled veteran owned sole sourcecontract for Project #562-09-505, Boiler Plant Deficiencies Project.This project, which was initially requested to be funded as an emergencyNRM (non-recurring maintenance), addresses the correction of specificdeficiencies that were identified in a VISN-wide Boiler Plant inspectionaudit.  Delay in the award of this contract could result in failedoperational performance which could ultimately result in a boiler plantshut-down which will adversely affect the entire medical center andcould result in closure of facility based on the boiler safetydeficiencies noted during the inspection.  It is imperative that work onthis project commence prior to the start of the cooling season.
As a result of market research, John B Henry & Associates, 1044 NProvidence Road, Media, PA 19063, a service disabled veteran owned smallbusiness, was recommended as having recent successful boiler plantexperience within VISN 4.  Contact was made with the company and it wasdetermined that the company was qualified and could meet the timelineidentified by the government.  As such, a proposal was requested andreceived on March 3, 2009.  Subsequent to receipt of proposal, theproject was converted from emergency NRM funded to a Recovery Actfunded.  
In accordance with IL 001AL-09-07 dated March 17, 2009, competitiveprocedures shall be used whenever possible.  However, based on theconditions stated herein and in accordance with PL 109-461, theContracting Officer has determined that continuation of this procurementstrategy is in the best interest of the Government and that the cost tothe Government is fair and reasonable.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Acquisition Center (RDECOM-AC) intends to award a purchase order in the amount of $26,900.83 on the basis of other than full and open competition to STS International for the integration of command and control system for the Combat Medic Basic and Advanced Trauma Trainer (CoMBATT) prototype system into a trailer configuration.  The anticipated period of performance will be six months.<BR><BR>The RDECOM-STTC determined full and open competition is not possible for the following reasons:<BR><BR>"	STS International possesses unique capabilities to meet these requirements due to the fact that they designed, built and integrated the original CoMBATT prototypes which are in use at FMTB east and by Army trainers.  This CoMBATT prototype uses the same software and many of the same hardware devices as the originals.  Any other vendor would be required to reengineer the existing hardware and software which would significantly increase the cost beyond any savings that a full and open competition could recoup.<BR>"	 The CoMBATT command and control equipment is being integrated into a trailer based system that must be compatible with preinstalled interfaces at the training site.  In order for another vendor to be able to perform this effort, substantial duplication of cost to the Government would be incurred which would not be recovered through competition.  <BR>"	Software changes to the CoMBATT control system will be required for interface into the trailer based power system.  Substantial software reengineering would be required for any other vendor to make these changes.  This would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the requirement.  <BR>"	The command and control station is required to be reconfigurable to work with existing CoMBATT equipment at sites other than the FMTB MOUT site.  Other vendors would incur substantial costs which would not be recouped in a full and open competition.<BR>"	The USMC and USN require that training capabilities be identical between east and west coast training sites in order for those capabilities to be integrated into the curriculum.  A CoMBATT prototype has already been installed into the FMTB training site at Camp Lejeune, NC.  The lack of a suitable fixed facility for the C2 system at Camp Pendleton requires a mobile configuration with the same capabilities.  If another vendor were to reengineer the system, they would be required to retrofit any changes into the FMTB East system.  This would incur substantial costs which would not be recouped in a full and open competition.<BR><BR>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 541330.  A response to this notice is not required.     See Note 22.  Email your questions to RDECOM Contracting Center - Aberdeen at nikia.s.jelks@us.army.mil.<BR><BR><BR>

<CONTACT>Chad R Parker, Contract Specialist, Phone 8028724111, Fax 8029516455, Email chad.parker@associates.dhs.gov
<DESC>USCIS requests industry input on the Agency’s need for access through a web-service interface to a contractor’s system whereby the contractor would provide financial viability information on companies petitioning to employ alien beneficiaries.  

This need is part of an initiative called Verification Initiative for Business Enterprises (VIBE). The USCIS Office of Service Center Operations (SCOPS) processes employment-based immigrant and non-immigrant petitions. SCOPS needs to determine the financial viability of a petitioning company.  Currently, the information used to determine financial viability comes directly from the company itself.  However, USCIS would like to verify the financial viability through a contract vehicle with an Independent Information Provider (IIP) to support the VIBE initiative.   It is anticipated that the forthcoming acquisition would require the following: 

• Algorithm development and refinement that will be used to reduce copious information into a simplified report for adjudicators to determine the  financial viability of petitioning companies
• Access through a web-service interface, to the IIP’s system, whereby USCIS can automatically transmit queries 
• Independent information provided from an IIP for a varying amount of monthly inquiries 
• Data investigation support for instances where no data resides in the database
• Data accuracy support for instances of insufficient data in the database
• Program management 
• Data analysis
• Training for adjudicators on the use and understanding of the data being provided by the IIP

During market research it was determined that licensing terms restrict customers from retaining information in any media once the contract has expired, and providing information to third parties, such as other Federal Government agencies, without prior written consent of the contractor. The Government requires licensing terms that allow the information provided to be retained in adjudicator files in perpetuity.   Further, this information may be viewed and used by other Government agencies for legal proceedings, such as court hearings or similar administrative hearing activities related to granting or denying immigration benefits. It has also been determined through market research that industry does not provide warranty terms regarding the accuracy of information provided.  The Government may potentially use the information in a court of law, as such, it must be supportable.  

Responses to this RFI should address the following: 

1) Ability and willingness to develop warranty terms.  If already available, describe the warranties you provide.  If warranties are somehow implicit, what level of accuracy is considered typical or acceptable?   

2) Ability and willingness to provide exceptions to standard licensing terms and conditions relating specifically to how the data provided can be used, stored, and maintained during and after the end of the contract?   

3) What would be the price impact of modifying standard licensing and warranty terms? Please describe the impact by showing it in relation to the pricing of standard licensing terms? 

4) Describe if your system has the capability to be accessed through a Web-Service.  If yes, can you please provide the Web-Service Definition Language (WSDL) or link to the WSDL through which you provide an interface?

5) How does your organization offer pricing if this information is accessed through a web-service?

6) Describe your ability regarding data investigation support.

7) Describe your ability to train users in the proper interpretation of the information provided.


Interested parties are to respond by addressing the above within 10 days from release of this RFI. The Government is not requesting a proposal and this RFI in no way obligates the Government to place an order.

<DESC>(a) The Tongass National Forest will host a pre-solicitation conference in Ketchikan, Alaska, on Monday, April 27, 2009, at nine o’clock in the morning.  The purpose of the conference is to share information with prospective offerors on the contemplated future request for proposals for the Wrangell Island Timber Harvest draft and final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  Prospective offerors interested in attending should make a reservation by contacting Kent Nicholson by e-mail at knicholson@fs.fed.us by close of business on Thursday, April 23, 2009, and sharing the names and titles of attendees and a brief four- to six-page summary of their experience in doing this sort of work and their initial advice to the Forest Service on how the acquisition might be conducted to provide a best value result (see (e) below).  The conference will not be available by telephone or other means, but minutes of the meeting will be posted afterwards by amendment to this posting.  The exact location in Ketchikan of the conference will be the Sunny Point Conference Room at the Best Western Landing Hotel, 3434 Tongass Avenue.  Their phone number is Toll free 800-428-8304 or local phone: 907-225-5166.

(b) The Tongass National Forest seeks an EIS prepared consistent with, and tiered to, the 2008 Tongass National Forest Land Management Plan (http://tongass-fpadjust.net/Documents/2008_Forest_Plan.pdf), Record of Decision ROD (http://tongass-fpadjust.net/Documents/Record_of_Decision.pdf), and the National Forest Management Act.  

(c) The proposed project area is located on Wrangell Island in southeast Alaska, within the Wrangell Ranger District of the Tongass National Forest.  The primary objective of the planned solicitation is to obtain a professional interdisciplinary team to collect necessary data and prepare a Draft and Final EIS for the Wrangell Island 10-Year Timber Sale project which will respond to goals and objectives identified by the Tongass Land Management Plan to help move the area toward the desired conditions as described in the Forest Plan to achieve the following:  (i) manage timber resources for the production of sawtimber and other wood products from suitable lands made available for timber harvest on an even-flow, long-term sustained yield basis, and in an economically efficient manner; (ii) seek to provide a timber supply sufficient to meet the annual market demand for Tongass National Forest timber and the market demand for the planning cycle; and (iii) provide between 150 to 200 MMBF of sawlog volume for a 10-Year Timber Sale contract on Wrangell Island.

(d) The Tongass National Forest intends to use a statement of objectives approach, rather than a statement of work approach.  Please visit http://www.acquisition.gov/comp/seven_steps/index.html for a summary of this approach.  The SOO will be a comparatively short document that will provide the basic, high-level objectives of the acquisition. It will be provided with the solicitation in lieu of a government-written statement of work or performance work statement.   In this approach, the offerors’s proposals will contain statements of work and performance metrics and measures which are based on their proposed solutions.

(e) At this stage, the Forest Service is interested in receiving inputs and suggestions from prospective offerors on the conduct of this acquisition.  For example, a prospective offeror might provide thoughts on whether the acquisition should be set aside exclusively for small businesses or other categories of businesses, the practicability of a firm-fixed-price contract, the advisability of a fixed-price-award-fee contract, suggested evaluation criteria to help us obtain a best value solution, and so forth.

These are subject to change over time.	A full and updated set ofassumptions will be released in the draft technical documents.	The binding baseline forthe contract will be in the RFP.)a) The SGSS Implementation Contract is responsible for replacing the user interface, userservice, and network command and control (space and ground) at the WSC and the GuamRemote Ground Terminal (GRGT).	The SGSS Implementation Contract will interface with theSpace Network Expansion  East (SNE-E) terminal for command and control.b) GRGT Space-to-Ground Link Terminal (SGLT) 6 and SNE-W (SGLT 7) will be treated as anintegrated Space Network Ground Segment (SNGS) site as the GRGT and will receiveequivalent SGSS-developed upgrades.c) Initial implementation of the SGSS will support nine sets of concurrent user services: 6 at WSC, 2 at Guam Remote Station (GRS), and 1 at SNE-E.d) To meet expected Continuity of Operations requirements, the SGSS Remote BackupSatellite Operations Center (RBSOC) will provide remote control (Telemetry, Tracking andCommunications (TT&C) and User Services) capabilities, but will rely on processing and RFchain at the primary SNGS sites.  For contingency operations, the RBSOC will have accessto other Space Communication and Navigation Program (SCaN) apertures (Near Earth Network(NEN) and Deep Space Network (DSN)).e) We are planning for a new ~19m space-to-ground link (SGL) dual Ku/S band TransitionAntenna to be made available to the SGSS Implementation Contractor at the WSC for thepurposes of aiding transition.f) In addition to new SGSS hardware, the SGSS monitor and control function must becompatible to monitor and/or control with other SNGS functions (Bilateration Ranging andTracking System (BRTS), Australian TDRS Facility (ATF)) and facilities (power, cooling,etc.)Notice 3:  SGSS Website Access RequirementsTo gain access to the SGSS procurement Library website, please log ontohttp://sgss.gsfc.nasa.gov  .

Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 3.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.  The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

•       Suitability.  All employees, working on-site, of the “selected” prime A/E firm and their consultants will undergo a background suitability check prior to the start of work consistent with Homeland Security Presidential Directive -12 (HSPD-12). 

Each employee shall send a completed Contractor Information Worksheet (CIW) along with two (2) FD-258 Fingerprint Cards to the GSA Security Point of Contact (POC).   

The completed CIW and fingerprint cards will be forwarded to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The DHS will reply to the employee with an electronic invitation which will include the website and password that the employee shall use to complete the Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P) electronically.   Upon receipt of the employee's electronic SF 85P, DHS will initiate the background check.  Completion of the SF 85P via the internet is MANDATORY.   However, if the employee does not have access to the internet, the contractor shall contact the Government who will furnish paper copies of the SF 85P for the employee to manually complete and return.  DHS will make a final decision on the employee’s acceptability.  The firms and employee will be informed of DHS’s predetermination.  

SELECTION INTERVIEW REQUIREMENTS: 

The Government intends to conduct personal interviews with those firms slated as most highly qualified.  The tentative dates of interviews are June 2 - 4, 2009.  Firms slated for interviews may be asked to expand upon any of the information presented in their proposal related to any of the evaluation criteria; to respond to questions to establish their understanding of government needs, policies, and approaches; and to provide technical approaches and conceptual design solutions to the project.  Elaborate presentations are not desired. The interview will be a total of one hour long.  The firms must bring to the interview, at a minimum, the key members of the proposed project team, such as the Project Manger and the lead engineers.  A site visit may be arranged during this period prior to the interview.  Debriefing requests will not be entertained prior to 45 days after the proposal due date.  It is the Government’s intent to incorporate Look-Up Tables into the contract which may be used as payment provisions at the Government’s discretion.

NOTE:  As part of the interview, the slated firms will be required to provide a preliminary subcontracting plan (support for small business subcontracting) if the firm is a large business concern.  Firms will be required to identify and commit to the published Small Business Subcontracting Program. As part of its Fiscal Year commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, the U.S. General Services Administration has established a subcontracting goal of 37 percent for small business, which includes 6.0 percent for small disadvantaged business, 5.0 percent for small women-owned business, 3.0 percent for small HUBZone participants, 3.0 percent for service disabled veteran-owned small business, and 5.0 percent to veteran-owned small business.  In support of the agency efforts, firms seeking consideration for this contract shall provide maximum practicable subcontracting opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, small women-owned, small HUBZone, and small veteran-owned businesses.  The use of subcontractors/consultants shown on the submitted SF330’s will be reflected in a Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan included in this contract.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified small business sources and their size classifications (i.e., HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, Veteran-Owned, and Small Disadvantaged Business) relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources.  Only small business sources shall respond to this sources sought synopsis.  

Project Title:  “Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA)”

Project Description:  The purpose of the SAMHDA is to provide access to substance abuse and mental health data in order to increase the use of data for understanding and assessing substance abuse and mental health problems, as well as the impact of related treatment systems.  SAMHDA is the sole point of distribution for the public-use files for the majority of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration’s (SAMHSA) Office of Applied Studies (OAS) surveys, namely the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), and the Treatment Episode Admissions and Discharge Data Sets (TEDS).  In addition, SAMHDA houses other data from SAMHSA and other key substance use and mental health studies, such as Monitoring the Future (MTF) and the baseline National Comorbidity Survey (NCS-1).  The data are currently distributed both as files and through online table-generating software.  All datasets are processed to ensure consistent display and documentation properties.

The contractor will be required to: 

1.	Host a web-based archive of datasets pertaining to substance use and mental health.  Users of the archive should be able to directly download the data files along with documentation or conduct online analysis of the data and access the documentation with ease.  The contractor will be required to maintain 24-hour/day access to current archive holdings by external users accessing the archive through the world wide web.
2.	Maintain the current repository of over 120 studies.
3.	Expand the archive to include new datasets from existing studies as well as new one-time studies in the fields of substance abuse and mental health.  Each year, the contractor should expect between 10 and 20 new datasets for inclusion into the archive.
4.	Process all incoming datasets such that they can be included in the archive for direct data file download, as well as for the online table generation.
5.	Ensure that file download systems and an online data analysis system are user-friendly with appropriate documentation and tutorials available to users.
6.	Provide a SAMHDA-wide search functionality that will identify words or terms in variable names, labels, question text and descriptions.
7.	Conduct disclosure analyses on non public-use datasets to determine disclosure risks.  Based on the results of the disclosure risk analysis, the contractor will be required to implement Statistical Disclosure Limitation (SDL) measures such that a public-use file can be created.  The contractor will be required to have an independent Disclosure Review Board (DRB) with external members who will determine the nature of disclosure risk and appropriate remediation action.  In addition, the contractor will need to possess a thorough understanding of laws and regulations related to data collection and dissemination in the areas of privacy and confidentiality.  The contractor should also have expertise in the determination of suppressions and other disclosure limitation methods required in a restricted-use online data analysis system that uses inaccessible confidential restricted-use data to produce public-use estimates and analyses.
8.	Make available an online data analysis system that can analyze data to produce estimates with their associated precision indicators.  The data analysis system should be able to estimate means and frequencies with their associated standard errors using replicates or Taylor series-based variance estimation variables.  The analysis system should also, at a minimum, be able to conduct linear and logistic regression analysis--correctly accounting for clustered designs in the variance estimation process.  Users should be able to create recoded variables from existing variables and apply filters in order to analyze a subset of the populations.  All output from the online data analysis system should be downloadable and easily copied into other formats.  The system should also be able to produce both weighted and unweighted estimates.
9.	Ensure that the online data analysis system applies precision- and disclosure-based suppressions and modifications to the generated estimates.  Examples of suppressions and modifications include cell suppressions, suppression of unweighted sample sizes, and suppressions described in table B.2 (http://www.oas.samhsa.gov/nsduh/2k7nsduh/AppB.htm)  in appendix B of the publication entitled, “Results from the 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings.” 
10.	Provide user-friendly methods of downloading data and documentation, including datasets in multiple formats such as ASCII, SAS, SPSS and STATA.
11.	Provide a method for users to login such that use and downloads can be tracked. Also provide a way for anonymous login and downloads.
12.	Create all materials, including the archive website, to be 508 compliant.
13.	Create dissemination and outreach materials, including conference booths, fliers, posters, brochures, postcards, presentation and workshop materials, etc.  The contractor will be expected to represent the archive at relevant conferences through staffing of the exhibition booth, workshops and presentations.  The contractor will be required to submit an annual outreach plan that outlines proposed activities and intended outcomes.  All outreach activities will need to be coordinated with and through SAMHSA’s Office of Communications.
14.	Provide assistance within one business day to all requestors via mail, email and the telephone, and create a list of frequently asked questions and answers.
15.	Be able to disseminate restricted-use data.  Such a program includes provisions for accepting and evaluating applications, creating customized datasets, making these datasets available to users in a secure manner, conducting site visits to ensure security protocols being met, entering into agreements with the researcher’s institution, and evaluating dissemination materials for potential disclosure risks.
16.	Be able to set up and manage a data enclave that provides confidential restricted-use data from a variety of sources.  The data would be disseminated either directly or through software portals.
17.	Ensure and maintain physical security of datasets so that the effect of a man-made or naturally occurring disaster (including intentional damage) is minimized.  The contractor will be required to maintain electronic security so that unauthorized alteration of public data or documentation, as well as data that have been archived or not public-use, is minimized. The contractor will be required to provide a data security plan to the government.
18.	Track detailed web usage statistics, costs per survey by contract year, help desk requests by survey and type of requests, website down time, file downloads, etc.
19.	Provide monthly and annual reports, reports related to each disclosure analysis and on any other topic as required by government project officer.
20.	Maintain a SAMHDA listserv to announce releases, special events and other key issues.
21.	Attend annual or half-yearly meetings with the government project officer.

<p><strong>May 14-15, 2009 (Ridgecrest, CA).&nbsp; The recent explosion in the adoption of the IRIG 106, Chapter 10 standard for digital recording has resulted in a number of interoperability issues, mainly reproduction and reconstruction as well as replay of one vendor's files by a second or third vendor's hardware or software.&nbsp; In order to address and solve this problem, the Recorder and Reproducer (R&amp;R) Committe, Telemetry Group, Range Commander's Council (RCC) is sponsoring a Chap 10 Recorder Industry Day.&nbsp; During the Industry Day, the participating vendors will generate a compliant IRIG 106-07, Chapter 10 file which will then be distributed to other vendors to validate reproduction, reconstruction and/or replay.&nbsp; Any and all errors in reproduction, reconstruction or replay will be documented and included in current and future government procurements and, if applicable, as additions to future IRIG 106 standards, specifically Chapters 6, 9, or 10.&nbsp; Attendees are invited from vendors of ground recorders, onboard/airborne recorders and software that have a capability to replay and/or display or process Chapter 10 data.&nbsp; Any and all vendors are welcome to attend the Industry Day.&nbsp; However, several prerequisites (sample files, complaincy matrix, documentation of known incompatibilities, etc) must be met before attendance.&nbsp; The host of this event will be NAVAIR, China Lake and an official visit requests must be also provided.&nbsp; For an information packet and details, contact Albert Gabaldon (<a href="mailto:albert.gabaldon@navy.mil">albert.gabaldon@navy.mil</a>, 760-939-6023) or Tim Chalfant (<a href="mailto:tim.chalfant@edwards.af.mil">tim.chalfant@edwards.af.mil</a>, 661-275-4444) or visit our website at <a href="https://wsmrc2vger.wsmr.army.mil/rcc/index.htm">https://wsmrc2vger.wsmr.army.mil/rcc/index.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a Purchase Order to Cellular Technologies Limited (Doing Business As: CTL Analyzers), 20521 Chagrin Blvd. Suite 200, Shaker Heights, OH 44122-5350. This is a small business set aside. A CDC Purchase Order will be issued to Cellular Technologies for one each BioSpot&reg; S5 Macro Analyzer with proprietary software and peripheral hardware upgrade, to include installation and shipping. For a complete line item listings of supplies and services that will be procured from Cellular Technologies see the attached schedule. This commercial equipment is being procured using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13, to exclude FAR Subpart 13.5. The authority for this sole-source acquisition is FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b). Justification for other than full and open competition is considered based on the belief that in order to improve lab capacity for influenza surveillance and pandemic preparedness, the CDC must implement a plaque reduction neutralization assay protocol, and that the patented BioSpot S5 Macro Analyzer is the only commercially available laboratory equipment and software compliment that can produce plaque counts in a 96-well plate format. Equipment with less capability would severely restrict influenza surveillance. It is further believed that a failure to utilize this equipment to implement plaque reduction assays will ultimately hinder or halt the progress of on-going research / studies currently being conducted by the CDC. Firms that believe they can provide the equipment, as listed in the attached schedule, are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of the publication date of this synopsis. Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. Respondents will assume all financial costs for preparing a response to this notice. The U.S. Government assumes no financial obligation for the preparation and distribution of prepared responses.

<ARCHDATE>05082009
<CONTACT>Joseph Cohn, DARPA Program Manager DSO, Email joseph.cohn@darpa.mil
<DESC><p>Special Notice DARPA-SN-09-30: Cognitive Modeling Information Gathering Workshop; this is a Request for Information (RFI) only; DATE: May 7th, 2009; Registration deadline: April 30th, 2009. TECHNICAL POC: LCDR Joseph Cohn, PhD, Program Manager, DARPA/DSO (joseph.cohn@darpa.mil).<br />DARPA/DSO will be hosting a workshop to gather information on how to use neural data to develop cognitive models. The workshop will be held at the Executive Conference Center, 3601 Wilson Blvd. STE 600, Arlington, VA.<br />The objective of this workshop is to understand how neural data can be used to inform and/or assist in the development and/or capabilities of cognitive models for use in various DoD applications. We believe there have been tremendous advances in our understanding of cognitive neural processes, such as in the areas of experience and expertise, to the extent that the field of cognitive modeling can be fundamentally changed. Recent technological advances in these fields of cognitive neuroscience and cognitive modeling lead DARPA to believe that focused technology development efforts may result in significant advances in these capabilities for national defense.</p>
<p>The workshop goals are to: (a) pulse the computational cognitive neuroscience community to determine state of the art in cognitive imaging and modeling; (b) evaluate current cognitive modeling techniques; (c) outline opportunities in advancing these cognitive modeling techniques using neural data; and, (d) identify impeding technical challenges in these areas to be overcome.</p>
<p>The workshop is limited to 25 participants, 1 participant per institution. There is no fee for the workshop and early registration is recommended. During the registration process, attendees are requested to submit a brief (600 words maximum) description of their current research highlighting their contributions to the field of computational cognitive neuroscience and/or their ongoing pursuit of new paradigms for representing human cognitive processes. Registration will be on a first come first served basis (https://safe.sysplan.com/dso/cogmod). Registration will close on April 30th, 2009 or once 25 participants are confirmed, whichever comes first. Upon confirmed registration, participants will be asked to prepare in advance and present at the workshop, a brief overview (3 slides / 5-10 minutes maximum) outlining their current research. This presentation should include: 1) key challenges to how cognition is modeled today and how their work is addressing these; 2) potential directions for revolutionary new approaches to modeling human cognitive processes such as experience and expertise; and 3) potential or current ways to quantifiably measure cognitive model performance (e.g. measures of effectiveness, measures of performance). Details and submission information are available at (https://safe.sysplan.com/dso/cogmod). Proprietary notifications will not be honored; participants must come prepared to share knowledge and ideas. We request that participant presentations adhere to the description provided and not serve as a platform to propose new program ideas, sell technology products, etc.</p>

DESCRIPTION

This technical purchase description is for a paper label adhesive for two types of water resistant adhesives for adhering paper labels to various substrates such as wood, fiberboard, metal, and glass.

Type I - solvent based
Type II - water emulsion

Salient Characteristics:

1. The adhesive shall be of brushing consistency and shall dry to a colorless, transparent film that will not reduce the legibility of printed label text.

2. The adhesive shall attach non-gummed paper labels to wood, fiberboard, steel, glass, or natural rubber, and labels shall remain firmly attached after exposure to low temperature, oil, and salt water when subjected to the following tests:  Prepare nine test panels of the following substrates:  wood, fiberboard, steel, glass, and natural rubber.  Clean test panels with a suitable solvent.  Coat the panels with a thin film of the adhesive; press a non-gummed paper label into place on the panel; then brush a thin film of the adhesive over the entire label and panel.  Air dry at 23C and 50% relative humidity for 24 hours.  Expose three panels of each substrate to the following conditions:  low temperature, -30C for 24 hours; 30W motor oil, one light coat for 24 hours; three coats of 4% sodium chloride solution (drying completely between coats).  At the end of the test period, attempt to peel the label from the substrate from each of the four corners.  The labels shall not be stripped from the test panels except in small chips no greater than 6 mm in any dimension.

3. Type I adhesive shall be tack free in a maximum of 5 minutes, and Type II adhesive shall be tack free in a maximum of 15 minutes when applied in a thin coat per manufacturer instructions for use on a clean, glass panel and dried at 23C and 50% relative humidity and tested in accordance with ASTM D 1640, paper test method.

4. The adhesive shall be water resistant as demonstrated by the following test:  One test panel of each substrate prepared as described in item 3 shall be immersed in distilled water for 18 hours followed by 2 hours of room temperature drying.  There shall be no whitening, dulling, or other visible defect, and the label shall not peel off from the substrate except in small chips.

5. The adhesive shall demonstrate flexibility by bending over a 6.4 mm (1/4 inch) mandrel in accordance with ASTM D 4338 using a steel panel coated with a film of adhesive and at a thickness recommended in the manufacturer's instructions for use.  The coating shall adhere tightly without cracking or flaking.

6. A container of the adhesive, after storage for 12 months from date of manufacture at 23C and 50% relative humidity, shall have no gelling, stringing, or other non-uniformity and show no signs of fungus growth. 

7. The product shall not contain (other than trace impurity amounts, not to exceed 0.06% liquid wt) any of the following:  hydrolyzable chlorine derivatives, ethylene based glycol ethers and their acetates, any carcinogen as defined in 29 CFR 1910.1200, and any of the following chemicals on the EPA 33/50 program in the following list:  benzene, cadmium & compounds, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, chromium & compounds, cyanides, lead & compounds, mercury & compounds, methyl isobutyl ketone, methylene chloride, nickel & compounds, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, and xylenes, nor any ozone depleting compound as listed in the Federal Register notice of July 30, 1992 (57 Fed Reg. 33753) which include chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has made a Sole Source  award to AMGRAF, INC. for the purchase of Annual Software Maintenance for AMGRAF OneForm. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The IRS has a continuing for need for OneForm software,  system is needed so that the production of tax products continue interrupted.  Maintenance includes all components of the hardware, operating system, and graphic software on the seven current composition workstations running Mecca 2000, the TFACS server, and the One Form Designer Plus software package.  Discontinuation of the maintenance services would have an adverse impact, and cause a work stoppage due to inoperable composition workstations or the server.  The impact of a work stoppage is considerable, especially during the fall production season where the composition employees need to be able to make the final revisions to tax products and produce a camera. This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids. The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action. If parties choose to respond, responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency however, any cost associated with the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with FEI Corporation of Hillsboro, Oregon for the purchase of a Maintenance Agreement for a FEI Helios Nanolab 600 under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106-(b): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  
The Sole Source determination is based on the need for the Helios Nanolab 600 to operate in accordance with the original equipment specifications from the manufacturer. 
The Helios Nanolab 600 is a leading edge product for FEI and no other company can supply certain proprietary parts or has the knowledge of proprietary aspects of the instrument in order to be able to service the Helios Nanolab.
FEI Company is the only company capable of providing the service. Specifically, the internal workings and unique details of the systems are proprietary to FEI Company. Due to the proprietary nature of these systems, no other vendor would be able to provide the required servicing of these systems. FEI Company does not license other vendors to utilize their proprietary technology. As a Result, FEI Company is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government’s requirement.

The resulting Purchase Order will be for one year.

 Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 1:00 p.m. (EST) on April 29, 2009.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to janet.lamb@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>Program Management, Aviation (PMA) 273, Naval Undergraduate Flight Training Systems, is sponsoring an unclassified Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) Industry Day on 12-13 May 2009.  The 12 May portion will be held at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Frank Knox Building 2189, Room 100, 21866 Cedar Point Road, Patuxent River, MD 20670. The 13 May session will be at Patuxent River, Naval Air Station, Building 442, 2nd floor conference room.
  
From 10:00 A.M to 12:00 P.M on 12 May, PMA273 will provide overviews of its programs and associated, long-term sustainment strategies.  From 1:00 P.M. to 4:00 P.M. and from 8:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M. on 13 May, Industry is invited to set up one-on-one sessions with the Program team.  Each session will be scheduled for two hours.  Attendance for the one-on-one sessions is limited to three per company.  This is a no fee event and seating is limited.

The PMA is developing long-term sustainment strategies for future support contracts.  For that reason, the Program Office is seeking Industry expertise and input on operations and support strategies for its platforms and associated training systems that include:  Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS), TC-12, T34, T-39, T-44, T-45 and TH-57.  Respondents are asked to address best practices, lessons learned and optimum long term support strategies that leverage off of existing programs.  Specific experience on effective requirements articulation, performance metrics, cost reduction incentives and contract strategies will be welcomed.

Support initiatives should be based upon a maintenance support strategy that encompasses commercial and Navy maintenance at the Organizational (O), Intermediate (I) and Depot (D) levels.  Contractors should consider total maintenance, logistics and technical support for each platform and all associated efforts necessary to meet daily flight schedules.  Respondents should be prepared to address the critical challenges the programs face today and in the future, such as obsolescence, aging aircraft, fatigue life management and divestiture planning.  PMA273 is looking to maximize Department of Defense (DoD) procurement processes with emphasis on contracting strategies that best support the War Fighter while remaining flexible enough to meet emergent requirements in a timely manner. 

A detailed agenda that includes specific questions and administrative details (POCs, directions, etc.) will be posted to the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) open solicitation website at the following URL: http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/index.cfm.  This information will be available on or about 20 April 2009.  Interested parties are encouraged to monitor this website for updated information.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The Government is not obligated to and
will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this posting.  The Government will not reimburse the attendees for any cost associated with participation or attending the Industry Day, and is under no obligation to award any related contract associated with this event.  Additionally, this announcement in no way commits the Government to issue a solicitation. The requested information is to assist the United States Navy in conducting Market Research. The final requirement(s), if any, would be defined under a formal Request for Proposal which would be announced on FedBizOpps (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/).

If you wish to attend, please e-mail djohnston@usaid.gov, and  lmckechnie@usaid.gov no later that 10:00a.m. on April 20, 2009.

The publication of this notice or any subsequent solicitations does not obligate the U.S. Government to make an award.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Performance Decision notification and completion of a streamlined competition study conducted by the Program Support Center, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  The study period for this competition was December 2, 2008 (public announcement date) through April 14, 2009 (certified performance decision date), under FBO Reference Number A76HHSPSCAOSMIDAMERICACASU.  On April 14, 2009, the resulting certification of the streamlined competition form by the responsible competition officials indicated that the performance of the commercial functions and operations of the Administrative Operations Service, Mid America Cooperative Administrative Support Unit should remain in-house with the agency's Most Efficient Organization (MEO). As a result of this performance decision, the responsible Contracting Officer shall execute a MEO Letter of Obligation with the agency official responsible for the performance of this commercial activity.  Consequently, no solicitation will be issued for these commercial services.

The purpose of this A-76 study was to determine the least costly and most efficient methods of operation as prescribed in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities, which sets forth the general policy of the Government to achieve economy and enhance productivity.  Consistent with procurement integrity, ethics, and standards of conduct rules, including restrictions of 18 U.S.C. 208, the responsible Contracting Officer submitted the streamlined competition form to the agency's incumbent service provider for review prior to this announcement of a performance decision. 

In accordance with the streamlined procedures as specified in OMB Circular A-76, revised May 2003, the streamlined competition form shall be made available to the public upon request.     It is further noted that no party may contest any aspect of a streamlined competition.

IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304c(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 – Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  A Firm Fixed Priced Award will be made in accordance with the following Description of Supplies:

DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES

A.  The following items will be provided:

CLIN 0001:
Description: Exhibit booth space (10’ X 10’)
Qty: Twenty-three (23)

B.  Period of Performance: 14 Sep 2009 through 17 Sep 2009

JUSTIFICATION

The Gaylord National Hotel on the Potomic has been selected to host this year’s Chief of Staff Team Excellence Award (CSTEA) participants.  The CSTEA has been scheduled for 14 – 17 September 2009.  Part of the CSTEA plan calls for exhibition displays, a ceremony, and a reception.  As participants in the CSTEA program, twenty-one competing CSTEA teams are required to set up exhibition display booths to network and dialogue on their process improvements.  The Air Force Association Veterans Benefits Association (AFAVBA) has selected the Gaylord National Hotel on the Potomic to host the AFA Annual Aerospace and Technology Exposition.  Air Force Manpower Agency (AFMA) planning committee has determined that it is in the Government’s better interest to hold the exhibitions, ceremony, and reception portion of the CSTEA program in the same facility where the awards and convention activities are scheduled to take place.  The AFAVBA has leased the entire Gaylord National Hotel on the Potomic for  14-17 September 2008 and has designated areas for exhibitions to be held during the convention at the Hotel.  During CSTEA 2008, the AFAVBA is the office of primary responsibility for setting up the AFA Annual Aerospace and Technology Exposition and the sole source for the rental of all areas within the Gaylord National Hotel on the Potomic.   The CSTEA planning committee recommends the AFA AFA Annual Aerospace and Technology Exposition as the source to satisfy the CSTEA requirement.  The AFA Annual Aerospace and Technology Exposition is tailored to the professional requirements of Air Force enlisted, officers, guardsmen, and reservists.  Furthermore, it provides AFMA a unique opportunity to promote the CSTEA program in an exclusive environment.  The effectiveness, spirit, and moral boost achieved by AFMA’s CSTEA Program will deteriorate considerably if AFMA is unable to secure exhibition booths and space as required by the CSTEA program.  Market research identified no other vendors providing compatible services within the Gaylord National Hotel on the Potomic vicinity during the CSTEA scheduled time frame.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be advantageous to the Government. The competing offerors' price is more important after technical information is accepable. The government seeks to award to the offeror who best meet or exceed the requirements affordably. A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror's quoted shall be made. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. A rating of unacceptable will render the entire proposal unacceptable. The Government will determine technical acceptability as described by the evaluation factors. In making this decision, the Contracting Officer will integrate the evaluation team's evaluations of the evaluation factors. While the evaluation team and the Contracting Officer will strive for maximum objectivity, the selection process, by its nature, is subjective and, therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors:</p>
<p>1. Technical Factor: Trained Contractor Personnel: The standard is met when adequate resumes/certifications for key personnel are provided with sufficient information indicating personnel education, experience as well as any other information relative to performance of this contract. The extent, depth and quality of the key personnel's relevant work experience, as well as the quality and applicability of their education technical experience and professional development as they relate to their proposed position in performance of the contract shall be evaluated.</p>
<p>The following technical evaluation factors will be evaluated and rated according to the chart listed below:</p>
<p>Rating Definition<br />Acceptable Acceptable - meets minimum mandatory requirements.<br />Unacceptable Unacceptable - does not meet minimum mandatory requirements.</p>
<p>2. Price Factor: This factor will evaluated the cost proposal to determine price analysis and price reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price. Offerors are specifically advised that, under this evaluation method, the government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices are unbalanced if they are significantly overstated or understated in relation to the actual cost of the work. This may be ground for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal. By signing its offer, the offeror certifies that the price stated on the CLIN includes an appropriate apportionment of all costs, direct and indirect, overhead, and profit. Review of the offeror price data will consist of an analysis to determine the following:</p>
<p>(A) Price Analysis. All cost and financial information required by th is RFQ and amendment (s) there to have been submitted. One or more of the following techniques may be used to perform price analysis.<br />(1) Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation.<br />(2) Comparison if prior proposed prices and contract prices with current proposed prices received for the same or similar end items.<br />(3) Comparison of proposed prices with Independent Government Estimates (IGE).<br /><br />(B) Price Reasonableness. Each quotation will be evaluated to determine whether the government considers the proposed price to be reasonable. The government will evaluate price reasonableness in relation to commercial or market price lists, IGCE, or any other information used as a basis or comparison.</p>

Description

The Food and Drug Administration is soliciting for Multivariate Analysis of Heparin Analytical Data.

(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals/bids are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This action is full and open competition.

(ii) The solicitation number is 09-222-SOL-00023. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).

(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-31, March 19, 2009.

(iv) This is a firm fixed price requirement.  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712.

(v) Description of Work:
-Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis (DPA) has analytical data for over 150 heparin sodium API samples from different suppliers with varying levels of OSCS and dermatan sulfate. The heparin NMR spectra, while having many consistent features, have a high degree of variability due to the heterogeneous nature of the carbohydrate. These data generated during the heparin crisis will be used to determine if sophisticated modeling methods can be used to discriminate between authentic and contaminated materials. Data will be supplied by DPA as *.fid files/folders.
-Initially, NMR data will be used to develop a multivariate mathematical model for characterizing heparin sodium, including heparin containing naturally occurring impurities such as dermatan sulfate (DS). The model will be internally validated to determine is robustness and ability to distinguish heparin with DS levels <1% from those samples having DS levels >1%. After the model is determined to be sound, it will further challenged with heparin containing the contaminant OSCS to determine its capability and sensitivity to detecting this known contaminant. The model will then be challenged by spectra from heparin sodium samples containing other oversulfated glucosaminoglycans that are prepared or purchased by DPA.  Additional analytical data from other laboratories or other methods (NIR and Raman spectra, CE, enzyme digestion) will be added to the model to improve its discrimination capability. Contractor will be expected to convert files as needed for forms useable by the developed model.


-Deliverables—This project will determine if pattern recognition models are capable of discriminating low levels of OSCS and other contaminants in heparin sodium. Offeror must provide all sorfware to convert files, create model and run model. Specific deliverables include: (1) Model discriminating heparin with different DS levels utilizing the entire NMR spectrum for heparin API from data generated at DPA. Model must discriminate heparin with <1% DS from heparin with >1%. Data from up to 150 samples will be provided by DPA to generate the model, due one month after receipt of order..(2) Demonstration of the model to discriminate heparin contaminated with OSCS. Data from up to 50 contaminated samples will be provided by DPA to challenge the model. Due one month after receipt of order. (3) Demonstration of the model to discriminate heparin contaminated with other GAGs and/or oversulfated GAGs. Data from up to 50 contaminated samples will be provided by DPA to challenge the model. Due two months after receipt of order. (4) Interim report detailing model development and model limitation based on DPA NMR data. Due three months after receipt of order.(5) Expansion of the model using NMR data submitted to the agency from pharmaceutical firms and/or using other analytical techniques such as CE or HPLC. Up to 400 additional data sets may be provided from DPA (data set equals one NIR spectrum, one HPLC chromatograph, or one NMR*.fid file) due four months after receipt of order.(6) Final report and demonstration detailing model development and limitations based on all data provided to vendor, due five months after receipt of order(7) At least one draft manuscript suitable for publication in a peer reviewed journal detailing the model development and performance, due six months after receipt of order.

(vi) Technical Evaluation: Offerors will be evaluated based on the completeness and throughness of their proposal as evidenced by its content and clarity. The following factors, listed indescending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate offers:
                                         Technical Approach
                                         Past Performance
                                         Organizational Experience

<p>At gary.smith@inl.gov</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>INVENTION SUMMARY:</p>
<p>A new method has been developed for real time in-pile elongation measurements during high temperature irradiation experiments in an operating nuclear test reactor. Instrumentation utilizing this method can be installed in high temperature (up to at least 1200 C) irradiation test capsules containing inert gases. This instrumentation will overcome limitations of Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) technology and should be of interest to dilatometer manufacturers since it provides protection from higher neutron fluxes and temperatures in the region where samples are placed.</p>

The Government intends to award a brand name contract for above product to SIEMENS.<BR><BR>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD BRAND NAME SIEMENS using the simplified acquisition procedures. Only one responsible source and not other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  In this project, we will be replacing an aging HVAC system for a building with a new, more efficient HVAC system.  Part of that system is the Direct Digital Control (DDC) system that controls and monitors the HVAC units.  The DDC system consists of electronic devices that attach to various points on the HVAC system, and a central control panel.  These components then interface with the Installation DDC Infrastructure that is already established to run all of the facilities for the Western WA ANG.  This established backbone is a Siemens brand system.  <BR><BR>The components that are currently in place are Siemens components.  This contract would replace or augment those items necessary for operation and monitoring of the new HVAC system.  The individual components must be able to interface and communicate with the existing Siemens backbone system.  <BR><BR>There are components from other manufacturers that the Siemens infrastructure can monitor, however, only Siemens products are able to be controlled by the operating system that resides in the BCE section.  From our terminal, we can turn on, turn off, and adjust all the HVAC systems for the base.  This gives us the ability to immediately troubleshoot and adjust HVAC units in case there are problems.  Other products would require a third party interface to translate information, and a separate computer program to run just that one building.  We had this arrangement in one of our buildings at one time and had to replace it because it did not work.  Siemens technicians periodically come down and perform maintenance on the code in the program, and this is where much of the conflict comes in with other components.<BR><BR>As this is a replacement of one small part of an overall system that has been in place for numerous years, this is not a new requirement.  Any future component replacements of the DDC system would need to also be Siemens products.<BR><BR>The Siemens brand products are carried by many distributors, so competition among vendors is available.<BR><BR>Delivery of the service will be not later than 1 May 2009. All quotations received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement. For specific questions, please contact Heidi R. Weber, Contract Specialist, heidi.weber@ang.af.mil.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number RFQ-OH-09-00058 is issued as a Request for Quotation. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32. This acquisition is unrestricted with a NAICS code of 541511 and size standard of $25,000,000.</p>
<p>Background: The U.S EPA's Clean Automotive Technology program conducts innovative research and develops advanced technologies that achieve ultra-low pollution emissions, increase fuel efficiency, and reduce greenhouse gases. This work is conducted at EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Through the program's development and demonstration of cost-effective technologies, it also encourages automotive manufacturers to produce cleaner and more fuel-efficient vehicles. The automotive technologies invented by the program include advanced-clean engines that efficiently use renewable and conventional fuels, and hydraulic hybrid vehicles.</p>
<p>EPA works cooperatively with industry and university partners throughout the United States to bring advanced automotive technologies from EPA's laboratory to market. EPA's industry partnerships are formalized through Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs). Automotive manufacturers benefit from cost-effective use and leverage of government resources to research and evaluate environmentally friendly technologies. They also help accelerate development of new technologies with commercial value and gain a competitive edge in a highly competitive global market. EPA benefits from the shared expertise of its partners and through sharing the high upfront costs of technology development.</p>
<p>Statement of Work: The Contractor shall provide a C Application Programming Interface (API) that will allow existing EPA engine and chassis control code written in C to be ported to the Pi Shurlok G850 Engine Controller. The API must enable complete functionality of the hardware through the use of intuitive C function calls and compile-time scripts. The API shall be compatible with the Wind River Compiler. The API shall also generate all necessary output files to enable the programming and real-time calibration of the controls operations through CAN Calibration Protocol (CCP) using ATI Vision. EPA has already made a significant investment in Pi Shurlok hardware controllers and ATI Vision calibration interfaces and would like to maintain a consistent development platform across projects. The combination of hardware and API for controls development will need to support the actions of the Agency's CRADA partners, allowing for continued joint development of advanced engine technology and hydraulic hybrid drivetrains.</p>
<p>Work Description and Specifications (for Software Delivery):</p>
<p>Work consists of providing an API software program to interface with hardware controls.</p>

<p>3) Sample applications exercising all functions in the API</p>
<p>4) Documentation of the C API</p>
<p>The supported targets will be all Pi Shurlok G850 hardware. The supported features will be:</p>
<p>1) Basic operating systems functionality</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Boot</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Scheduler</p>
<p>2) Reprogramming</p>
<p>3) Calibration - Read &amp; Write Support via CCP</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) C Integer &amp; Floating Point Values</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) C Pointers &amp; Data Arrays - including 1-D and 2-D Maps</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Items Contained within C Structures and Unions</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Digital input</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Digital output</p>
<p>5) Access to angular I/O functionality</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Configuration of engine parameter</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Analog output</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Digital output</p>
<p>6) Communication</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Access to CAN functionality</p>

Concurrent with software delivery, the Contractor shall provide on-site support as necessary to demonstrate that the software meets all requirements identified in this Statement of Work.</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this to this acquisition. The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items is applicable and the specific evaluation criteria are as follows:</p>
<p>1) Project Approach: Offerors shall include sufficient information to demonstrate that they understand the Statement of Work requirements and have the ability to develop software which will meet or exceed those requirements.</p>
<p>2) Experience: Offerors shall identify at least three recent contracts under which the offeror successfully developed software that is comparable to this proposed EPA contract. These references shall include the name of client, client's contact information (name, phone number, and email address), contract value, and description of the software which was developed.</p>
<p>3) Price</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a contract on a best value basis to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<DESC>Synopsis: 

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES    (JUN 2006)
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.

"ENCLOSURE:  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, 
Notice for Filing Agency Protests, is included with this solicitation.
Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Ombudsman Program
The Coast Guard Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests is a program intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns informally within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. It is designed to resolve contractor protests in a faster, less expensive manner than could be accomplished at an external forum. Concerns of interested parties can be resolved through independent, government binding adjudication taking place outside the procuring activity's chain of command.

Filing Agency Protests
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Place of Performance:  Marine Corps Combat Development Command, Quantico, VA 22192
Performance Work Statement:  The Capabilities Development Directorate (CDD) and the Operations Analysis Division (OAD), Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) is responsible for employing and maintaining the Class V(W) War Reserve Munitions Requirements (WRMR) model, which has been accredited for use in the Marine Corps' Munitions Requirements Process (MRP).  The Contractor is responsible for providing data collection, management and modeling that effectively employs the WRMR model to forecast Marine Corps total munitions requirements, support procurement and programmatic decisions, and to develop combat planning factors (CPF) for use in operational planning.  This includes refining and updating the Marine Corps Requirements Generator by establishing compatible interfaces between the WRMR model produced CPFs and the capability to produce reports. Owned by MCCDC and hosted on a conventional desktop computing devices, the WRMR model is a deterministic application that establishes an unconstrained!  requirement (not limited by inventory, or funding or logistical limitations) that complies with Department Of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 3000.4.  Inputs are developed through SME interface with Marine Corps sponsors, which are then used to develop and refine usage and forecasting scenarios respective of ammunition stock levels and anticipated Dept-wide investment.  Within this framework are requirements to incorporate updates for ammunition requirements resulting from new equipment fielding and to maintain the applicable model, database, and methodology documentation.  Key objectives of this effort include ensuring and preserving the integrity of the data inputs, (e.g., assumptions, campaigns, scenarios, data derivations and planning factors) developed within ground ammunition requirements.  This process must be sufficiently documented such that senior leadership officials responsible for Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development and OSD submissions have complete conf! idence in the fidelity of the dataset, associated algorithms, and outputs that serve as the basis for Marine Corps investment.  Critical success factors associated with these objectives include:  Establishing a framework for collecting necessary data and interfacing with USMC SMEs to ascertain weapons system attributes; ensuring adherence to DODI 3000.4 criteria for forecast reporting; improving the fidelity of the requirements generation process by establishing compatible interfaces between CPF outputs and the Time Phased Force Deployment Data List (TPFDDL); and performing necessary regression testing properly verify, validate and accredit the WRMR model on an annual basis.   Key performance factors supporting this outcome include:   Employing the WRMR model to generate the annual Class V(W) Total Munitions Requirement (TMR); generating system specific ammunition requirements per DODI 3000.4; generating specific reports culled from TMR and CPR datasets; and generating biennial OSD sufficiency assessments.  Supporting activities include:  Docu! menting the configuration of the model and preserving its integrity through updates and modifications to structure; recommending improvements to Marine Corps staff that enhance performance, data granularity, or forecast fidelity; and providing reports, or briefings to senior Marine Corps leadership and other government/military organizations with respect to the use of the model.  
Instructions:  Offeror's should address the requirements cited in the PWS in the context of their ability to satisfy performance objectives by describing their technical capability, staff qualifications and past performance.  Offeror's should provide at least two relevant examples of past performance and include a citation description and POC information for the customer, including the COR and PCO.  Offeror's pricing should clearly demonstrate their selection of labor (e.g., hours ), qualifications, and intended allocation of time to the objectives set forth in the PWS, and the hourly rate.  The aggregation of labor hours times the rate across the labor categories is the basis for the FFP CLIN pricing.  This should be accomplished for the Base and Option Years.  Responses are limited to 25 pages inclusive of pricing.
Evaluation Factors:  a) Technical Capability:  Offeror's ability to meet the Government's requirements as set forth in the PWS paragraph, inclusive of their understanding and approach to munitions management, ability to plan and forecast using applied modeling techniques, and ability to coordinate with USMC leadership to ascertain requirements and objectives.b)  Staff Qualifications:  Offeror's ability to execute their strategy using a collaborative approach that efficiently employs a multi-disciplined staffing model with expertise  across the objective support areas delineated in the PWS paragraph.c)  Past Performance:  Offeror's experience with, and quality of performance supporting similar modeling and database efforts on behalf of DoD requirements sponsors.  d)  Price:  Offeror's proposed pricing will be evaluated for price reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3.   The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 
Ratings:Excellent - Exceeds the standard by providing a capability, or solution representing superior value and low risk to the government;Acceptable - Meets the standard and provides a capability that represents an expected level of performance / capability and acceptable risk to the government; or Unacceptable - Fails to meet the standard and is unlikely to provide the expected level of performance / capability expected by the government without high risk.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is  responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.

INTRODUCTION

OFDA has been providing humanitarian assistance in Pakistan since 2000, responding to natural disasters including earthquakes and floods as well as to the needs of internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have been displaced due to conflict.  Additionally, OFDA has supported disaster risk reduction programs in Pakistan since 2002.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 and to date in FY 2009, USAID/OFDA has provided more than $9.2 million in humanitarian assistance to Pakistan, including more than $4.3 million to conflict-affected populations and host communities in Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP) and more than $4.9 million in response to earthquakes and floods.  At present, OFDA is supporting programs in health, nutrition, humanitarian coordination and information management, risk reduction, shelter, water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions, non-food items, and logistical support.

Responding to the growing number of IDPs is an important focus for OFDA in Pakistan.
On February 9, 2009, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported a total of 290,845 IDPs in NWFP, with only 59,140 residing within camps.  Relief agencies and district authorities have registered IDPs in Peshawar, Nowshera, Mardan, Kohat, Upper Dir, Lower Dir, Charsadda, Swat, and Swabi districts of NWFP.  Limited humanitarian access remains a challenge in reaching IDPs in many of these areas.  

OBJECTIVE

USAID/OFDA requires the services of a Senior Humanitarian Advisor to be based in either Islamabad or Peshawar, Pakistan, to ensure that OFDA’s objectives for disaster assistance, strategic reporting, interagency coordination, and situational analysis are met.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This position requires an individual who is able to reside in Islamabad or Peshawar, as determined in consultation with the Embassy and the Mission and subject to security and programmatic considerations.  It also requires willingness to travel within and outside of Pakistan on short notice for two to three weeks at a time, or longer.  The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for OFDA's ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in Pakistan, as well as for other disaster risk reduction and training programs.  The incumbent will work closely with the USAID/Pakistan Mission, the US Embassy and its border office, international organizations (IOs), non governmental organizations (NGOs), the United Nations and NATO-led forces where appropriate, to respond to humanitarian needs and sudden onset disasters. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will be responsible for program analysis, program monitoring, oversight of program implementation, as well as reporting to OFDA Washington, USAID Pakistan, as required, and U.S. Embassy staff. 

This position requires substantial coordination with representatives from other USAID offices, the US Embassy and its border office, the Government of Pakistan (GOP), military representatives, as well as with relevant United Nations (UN) and NGO agencies, therefore requiring a highly collaborative work style.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  

Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the OFDA Principal Regional Advisor (PRA) for Asia and in consultation with USAID/Pakistan, the incumbent will:

•	Serve as the principal point of contact for OFDA in Pakistan for humanitarian issues, and serve as a liaison on program issues among the USAID mission, U.S. Embassy and its border office, military representatives, OFDA/Washington and the overall humanitarian community.
•	Lead efforts to identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements and target beneficiary groups and locations, and existing relief programs, and recommend the types of interventions and budget levels necessary to support OFDA-funded programs in Pakistan.  
•	Monitor ongoing programs and the overall humanitarian assistance efforts in Pakistan.  Regularly review partner’s reports, coordinate with OFDA/Washington on issues of mutual interest, and provide coordinated Washington and field feedback to the partners.
•	Coordinate closely with OFDA/Washington, the USAID Mission, U.S. Embassy and its border office, and military representatives as well as the UN and NGO agencies working in Pakistan.
•	Coordinate collection of information and provide updates and recommendations through written reports on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:
o	Capacity and level of activity of indigenous institutions to carry out relief programs;
o	Capacity and ability of UN, IOs, and NGOs to carry out programs;
o	Capacity of the logistics infrastructure to support programs;
o	Security situation of personnel, convoys, and relief operations in general;
o	Impact of GOP activities on humanitarian programs; 
o	Contributions by other donors, problems arising from implementation of relief programs, and any other issues that require the attention of OFDA; and  
o	Humanitarian coordination issues and any recommendations for change.
•	Provide guidance to organizations that are developing proposals for OFDA, based on OFDA’s Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting; review concept papers and proposals and provide timely recommendations/comments to OFDA/ Washington.
•	Present OFDA perspectives to NGOs, IOs, and UN agencies relating to humanitarian assistance strategies and priorities, including OFDA’s approach to humanitarian protection.  Work closely with the PRA to discuss and understand sectoral priorities.
•	Visit OFDA-funded projects, as security permits, and report on a timely basis to  OFDA/Washington on the quality of grantees’ work, noting deficiencies, attributes, and evolving operational conditions.  
•	Represent U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian interests at national and international meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.
•	Maintain regular liaison with UN, NGOs, IOs, the GOP, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.
•	Maintain regular, close coordination and communication with the PRA and OFDA/Washington.  
•	Contribute to field reports on trends, individual agency programming issues, and topics such as humanitarian protection and coordination.
•	Submit situation reports and assessment reports whenever necessary, including monthly official reporting cables or as the situation warrants.
•	Ability to operate standard field communications equipment; may be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will report directly to the OFDA PRA for Asia.  However, for many activities, the Senior Humanitarian Advisor will coordinate tasks directly with personnel within USAID/Pakistan, and in collaboration and consultation with other USAID and U.S. embassy staff.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor does not have the authority to commit OFDA resources without approval from the OFDA PRA and OFDA/Washington.   

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
Supervisory controls will be minimal.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.  The OFDA PRA for Asia will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

12.  START DATE:  Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is  responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.

INTRODUCTION

As part of OPS, the OFDA Safety and Security Coordinator (SSC) and Safety and Security Specialist (SSS) play a central role in the U.S. Government’s (USG’s) disaster response, humanitarian assistance, and disaster risk management programs.  The Safety and Security Unit (SSU) assists the office in identifying, evaluating and mitigating safety and security risks to OFDA field operations.  The SSU monitors security issues and events, develops security strategies, protocols and procedures, and maintains a cadre of qualified security professionals available for OFDA deployments.  The OFDA SSU also promotes enhanced safety and security approaches in the wider humanitarian community, including NGOs and United Nations (UN) agencies, through their outreach and donor activities.

OBJECTIVE

OPS requires the services of a Safety and Security Specialist in order to enhance its capability to manage the increasing safety and security issues related to OFDA field deployments.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

•	Liaise with USAID Office of Security, other USG agencies, UN, and NGO offices on the issue of staff safety and security.  This may include participation in inter-agency security fora.  Establish relationships with other relevant organizations such as the European Community Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO), and the UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS).  
•	Serve on OFDA Response Management Teams (RMT) and Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DART) as Safety and Security Officer (or other positions), as required.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The OFDA Safety and Security Specialist will report directly to the Safety and Security Coordinator, who in turn reports to the OPS Division’s Field Support Team Leader.  He/she will work closely with USAID/SEC (Office of Security), in order to ensure consistency with overall USAID security objectives and the sharing of information between OFDA and SEC.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
The incumbent is expected to take initiative, work in a collaborative manner, yet able to act independently, and perform with minimal direction in responding to humanitarian emergencies as part of a fast-paced office environment.  The supervisor will set overall objectives.  The Safety and Security Specialist will work with the Safety and Security Coordinator to develop deadlines, projects, and work to be done.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

"ENCLOSURE:  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, 
Notice for Filing Agency Protests, is included with this solicitation.
Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>Please submit RSVPs and agenda topics as soon as possible. They are due NLT 13 March 2009. See paragraph 3 below for full details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FA8202-09-R-1001<br />A-10 European and Pacific In-theater Depots<br />Draft RFP and Pre-Proposal Conference</strong></p>
<p>The A-10 System Program Office (SPO) hereby posts the attached draft RFP for industry consideration and would also like to announce a pre-proposal conference to discuss the United States Air Force requirement for in-theater contract depot repair support for A-10 aircraft based overseas at Spangdahlem AB, Germany (USAFE) and Osan AB, Republic of South Korea (PACAF). The A-10 SPO is interested in meeting with industry representatives to answer questions and receive feedback regarding this requirement to assist with acquisition planning and program strategy.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p><br />There are two separate contracts associated with this Pre-Proposal Conference. For each region of operation, Europe and the Republic of South Korea, the U.S Government intends to make a single award to a technically responsive source with a 5-year Requirements type contract. The estimated workload is 3-6 aircraft inductions per fiscal year for SLEP/SSI plus occasional drop-in maintenance and Contract Field Team deployments as necessary. Future aircraft modification programs may also be a requirement for these contracts. Best Estimated Quantities are included in the attached RFP. Please note that although Precision Engagement modifications will be included as a requirement for PACAF, this will be an optional CLIN. As of this time, the USAF has not made a final decision on whether to accomplish PE at the in-theater contract depot.</p>
<p>In order to be considered for this workload, a qualified offeror must operate the proposed depot maintenance facility within unrefueled A-10 flight range (400 Nautical Miles) of the respective A-10 operating location (Spangdahlem or Osan AB).</p>
<p><br /><strong>Draft RFP</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><br />The attached draft RFP is being included for industry comment/consideration and IS NOT a formal Request for Proposal. The government seeks industry feedback on all aspects of this draft solicitation including the PWS. In addition, the government is seeking input on the following items of interest:<br />1. The number of flow days the contractors feel that each FFP task will require as set forth in Section B. <br />2. The feasibility of providing past performance that meets the relevancy criteria in Section M, para 2.1.2.<br />3. The clarity of technical evaluation subfactors in Section M, para 2.4 - 2.6.<br />4. The clarity of Section L, Instructions to Offeror</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please provide written comments on the draft RFP by 1600 MST 13 Mar 2009.</span></strong></p>
<p>Not all portions of the draft-RFP are being posted at this time. Updates/additions will be posted when and if they become available. Please check FBO often for updates.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Proposal Conference</strong></p>
<p>1. The purpose of this conference is to provide open dialogue between government and industry in response to the draft RFP. In order for this to be an effective exchange, the government requests a list of agenda topics and specific questions that industry would like the Government to address. The Government does not intend to present additional information beyond what has been made available in the draft RFP and previous FBO postings. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please submit your agenda topic recommendations and specific questions to the industry day POC not later than 13 March 2009.</span></strong> Early submissions are encouraged.</p>
<p><br />2. At this time the government does not intend to limit the number of representatives attending from each contractor's firm. However, depending on responses from industry, the government may be forced to impose limits due to room capacity.</p>
<p><br />3. In order to attend Industry Day, each contractor must provide the following for each attendee:<br />a. Name, address and CAGE code of firm<br />b. Indicate status of company - Small Business or Large Business<br />c. Full Name of individual, citizenship status and contact information<br />This information must be received by the Pre-Proposal Conference POC via email not later than <strong>13 March 2009</strong>.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In addition, all foreign national attendees must submit a Foreign Visit Request through their respective embassy and provide a clearance number.</span></strong> Please contact the Pre-Proposal Conference POC with any questions or concerns.</p>
<p><br />4. If time permits, one-on-one sessions may be offered on 17 March after the open sessions. These sessions will be coordinated at the conclusion of the open session.</p>
<p><br />5. An optional tour of the Ogden Air Logistics Center A-10 Depot Repair Line is being considered. Please indicate your interest in attending a tour and the names of attendees by <strong>13 Mar 2009</strong>. Note: this tour will be identical to the tour given at the Nov 2008 industry day. No new information will be provided and this is primarily geared towards contractors who were unable to attend the November 2008 industry day tour.</p>
<p><br />6. A Base Access Letter will be coordinated in advance once your RSVP and Foreign Visit Request (if applicable) have been received. If you require any assistance obtaining base access or directions to Hill AFB please advise the Industry Day POC.</p>
<p><br />7. Additional details regarding this Industry Day will be posted once they become available. Please check back for updates.

<p><br />The below was a question from a contractor to our customer requesting additional specification clarification:</p>
<p>1. Is there a specific brand or model size of excavator you are looking for, for example a cat 330 or 345? If so can we use a different machine with equivalent capabilities?</p>
<p><br />The CAT 330 or 345 (or equivalent) should work. Something comparable to the John Deere 350D LC would be good. It has a reach of approx 36 ft. But its 8 ton lift capacity reach is approx 20 ft. Its max dig depth is approx 24 ft. The machine will be placed in the creek bed by crane and will be digging down into the creek bed as well as into the side of the creek bank. The digging into the side of the bank could be up to approx 20 +/- ft above the creek bottom. Digging down below existing creek bottom could be approx 10+/- ft. Because the excavator will be placed by crane, if two excavators have similar capacity but different weight, we would prefer the lighter weight.</p>
<p>2. If you don't have a specific machine you are looking for we'll need more information on the lift capacities required. The RFQ asks for a machine that can lift 8 tons. Will that be over the front of the tracks or over the side? Also how high will the machine be required to lift 8 tons from ground level?</p>
<p>I would think one bucket with 2-3 CY capacity should work.</p>
<p>3. What size of bucket do you require, And if you need multiple buckets, and if you need a quick disconnect?</p>
<p>We would like a bucket WITH:</p>
<p>-Teeth</p>
<p>-Thumb combo (this requirement was with the original description - but not with the example I sent yesterday)</p>
<p>-A width of 48" to 60"</p>
<p>-2-3 CY capacity</p>
<p>4. What level of tier compliance does the machine require, if any?</p>
<p>The equip is subject to compliance with the California Air Resources Board and Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District which I believe would be Tier 2 or 3 depending on the hp or kw, date of manufacture, size of fleet, etc. Tier 4 compliance is coming in the future but not this year.</p>

<DESC>FYI: In accordance with the Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 1.1.2 The FAA has been relieved from the requirements of the Brooks Act.  Therefore, we are allowed to request pricing information prior to the technical "down-select". (Added 4/14/09)
Amendment A002 issued 4/6/09 to add CLINs for Overtime for Non-exempt Personnel.
Amendment A001 issued to correct the clause reference in the Travel and Subsistence CLINs to H.8, rather than H.12.
The FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center has a requirement for environmental architecture and engineering (A&E) services.  Prospective activities include field investigations, production of plans, specifications, studies, calculations, estimates, laboratory analyses, preparation of worker health and safety, sampling and other plans, field sampling (including groundwater, soil, sediment, surface water and air), and detailed counter-measure plans; noise evaluations; industrial waste water pretreatment; air quality (including indoor air quality; environmental assessments (EAs) and environmental due diligence audits (EDDAs); hazardous material storage and handling; groundwater assessments; SARA Title III program; PCB abatement; pollution prevention opportunity assessment, and fuel storage tank management. (See attached Statement of Work.)
It is anticipated than an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract, with fixed labor hour provisions, will be awarded covering these environmental A&E services.  Requirements are estimated at $200,000 per year.  The resultant contract will include a base year and four 1-year renewal options.  These options may or may not be exercised, at the sole discretion of the FAA.
This requirement is available for full-and-open competition.
A technical, as well as cost, evaluation will be conducted to determine "Best Value" to the FAA.  A description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).
The A&E firm's submission of Standard Form (SF) 330 must demonstrate its qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors.  The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Specific evaluation factors include: 
1. Specialized Experience and Technical Competence-Offeror shall submit examples (detailed reviews) illustrating technical and managerial capabilities utilized in each of the following areas: (i) environmental assessment (NEPA) or environmental due diligence audit, (ii) pollution prevention project implementation (can include permit compliance projects), (iii) environmental management system implementation (can include ISO 14001 implementation), and (iv) environmental remedial investigation and design (CERCLA) performed within the last ten (10) years.  These reviews must illustrate the scope of each effort, their complexity, how schedules were implemented and how objectives were met (include timetables.)  Projects completed for the Federal Government, in particular, should be included, if any.
2. Past Performance-For each of the examples presented in response to Factor 1 above, offerors shall provide information on past performance in terms of cost control, quality of work, accuracy of construction cost estimates, and the number, dollar amounts, and reasons for construction change orders.
3. Professional Qualifications Necessary for Satisfactory Performance of Required Services-Offeror shall submit a complete rsum of the experience of each executive/supervisor and technical staff member presently employed by the company who will be devoting all, or a majority of, their time to this contract.  Rsums should include:  name, educational background, present position or title, types of experience by years, and any other information in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and administrative or technical competence.  Rsums of key individuals employed by subcontracted firms shall also be included.  For executive/supervisory personnel, a minimum of three years of direct executive/supervisory control of an organization involved in the planning and implementation of complex environmental projects is required.  The project manager or supervisor must be a registered Professional Engineer currently registered in the state of Oklahoma or able to obtain such registration within thirty (30) days of contract award.  For technical personnel, a minimum of three years experience in the design and execution of a variety of complex environmental investigations is required.  Offeror shall provide documentation as to laboratory capability for one or more primary laboratories and one or more quality assu7rance laboratories.  Documentation should be sufficient to indicate that laboratory capabilities in such areas as analytical methodology, quality assurance and reporting are equivalent to those required of laboratories participating in the EPA Contract Laboratory Program (CLP.)  Evidence of current participation, as a CLP laboratory, will be sufficient to meet this requirement.
4. Capacity to Accomplish the Work in the Required Time-Offeror shall submit a description of the firm's current workload; i.e. total number of on-going projects, their value or fee and their percentage of completion.  In addition, examples of completed projects and time tables associated with their completion should be provided.  Clearly indicate how the workload of this contract can be accomplished within present resources or a plan should be submitted which demonstrates growth capability commensurate with workload requirements and the effect of this contract.  If offeror does not presently employ sufficient executive/supervisory or technical personnel to meet the requirements, submit a plan for recruitment along with minimum experience levels that are required.  Employment of subcontractors shall be considered recruitment for the purpose of the criterion.  In addition, offeror shall provide a description of its cost accounting and control system.
5. Geographic Location-The offeror's geographic location relative to the Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, will be evaluated in this element, with higher scores given to those firms closest to the Aeronautical Center.
6. Minority and Women Employment-The percentage of minority employees in all job classifications and pay scales, noting the percentage of minorities in the immediate locality and general surrounding area, and the number of women in all job classifications and pay scales, will be evaluated.
Should subcontracting arrangements be required to perform under the proposed contract, all subcontractors must also complete the SF330, with the prime contractor submitting them as a part of their technical proposal.  
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (April 23, 2009).  Reference AMS clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), "if the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."
In addition, offerors must complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
Complete submittals, both technical and cost proposals, must be received by the FAA, no later than 3:00 p.m. CST, Thursday, April 23, 2009.  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.
Hand-delivered responses will need to allow sufficient time to process through security procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.  Overnight delivery of responses to this SIR/RFO could also be impacted if not sent in sufficient time to allow for special mail handling procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.
Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the solicitation process.
The FAA reserves the right to no longer consider on this acquisition, firms which fail to respond, firms with respond incompletely, or firms which respond with any information found to be verifiably false.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this announcement.

<DESC>The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act—A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) stipulates that the Secretary of Transportation must make a number of determinations before a grant or loan can be made for the construction of any project seeking Section 5309 New Starts funds.  These determinations require that the planning process generate credible information on project costs, ridership, financing, and environmental impacts.   49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 Section 5309 contains criteria for determining whether New Start projects are eligible for funding.  The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Office of Planning and Environment (TPE) assesses New Starts projects to verify that requirements for eligibility for New Starts funding have been met.

Reviews of past New Starts projects have documented that ridership forecasts have frequently varied significantly from ridership experienced after those projects have been opened for service.  As part of the 1993 Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) that requires Federal agencies to improve the effectiveness of their programs and their accountability to the public, FTA included in the Final Rule on Major Capital Investment Projects (New Starts, 49 CFR Part 611) (published on December 7, 2000, effective April 7, 2001) several provisions that integrated Before and After Studies into the New Starts project development process.  Section 611.7(c)(4) of the Final Rule requires that the sponsor of a New Starts project develop, early in final design, a plan to identify the impacts of the project and to examine the accuracy of forecasts for the project.  The FTA issued guidance on Preservation of Information for Before and After Studies on May 16, 2006, available at:
http://www.fta.dot.gov/planning/newstarts/planning_environment_5203.html#2_Preservation_of_Information_for_Before_and_After_Study_

The objective of this procurement is to provide oversight support services to the Office of Planning and Environment (TPE) of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).  FTA anticipates that the required services will focus on three functional areas:

1. Review of travel forecasts

2. Preservation of travel forecasts

3. Assistance with Before and After Studies

TASK 0001 - Review of Travel Forecasts



If you are interested in this requirement, please submit your proposal by May 14, 2009 3:30pm (Eastern Standard Time) 

Questions pertaining to this requirement will be answered from Aprl 15, 2009 thorugh April 23, 2009.  Questions submitted after April 23, 2009 may not be answered.

<DESC>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are seeking small businesses [HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, small disadvantaged, 8(a), and woman-owned] ONLY, that are capable of manuscript handling and publishing of a scientific journal. The Journal of Regulatory Science will publish a wide menu of articles relevant to regulatory science and should help all stakeholders share knowledge of what constitutes good regulatory science.  Reflecting the broad purview of FDA work, articles will be published in any field of human and animal medical product development as well as in areas of non-medical product use such as human and animal food and nutrition, food additives, and cosmetics.  Scientific and policy issues related to pre-market review, regulation of product manufacturing over time and patient safety in real world use will all be eligible topics.  One goal of the journal would be to demonstrate what lessons can be learned from past research and regulatory decisions.  Another unique goal is to promote publication of studies with negative results in order to expedite and focus decision making which may be valuable to advance medical product development.

For manuscript management, the capable source must be able to design the appearance of the journal, perform copy-editing, layouts, typesetting figure and table preparations, be Section 508 compliant, provide a site for centralized manuscript submission, receipt, handling, assignment, peer review and revision, and develop a program for marketing the publication.  

The FDA anticipates that this would be a multiyear effort. The mental and physical requirements of work would be defined in terms of observable and measurable descriptors. 

Interested parties should submit: a) A brief statement of interest, b) company name, point of contact and phone number, c) web-site address (if available), d) if more than one entity would collaborate on this project, the name(s) and contact information for the other entity(ies) and a brief statement of how the entity(ies) would work together and how the collaboration would enable them to conduct the work. Please remember that there is a limitation on subcontracting (FAR clause 219-14- DEC 1996). PLEASE DO NOT EXCEED 5 PAGES. This request for information is neither a request for competitive proposals nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. Please send information electronically to Mrs. London Johnson at London.Johnson@fda.hhs.gov.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with PerkinElmer LAS, Inc., 710 Bridgeport Avenue, Shelton, CT 06484.  The National Institutes on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Division of Intramural Research in Baltimore, Maryland requires an UltraView PC Upgrade Kit, Photokinesis Upgrade Kit ERS5/6 NSy (Vol) L7265225, Dell 30” TFT Monitor L7201892, Firewire Card IEEE-1394 3 Port PCI Card I3*9310, Firmware Upgrade for Orca ERG Camera L7265150.  PerkinElmer LAS, Inc. designed the 5 line spinning disk confocal microscope used in the Section.  The photokinesis unit supplied by PerkinElmer is the only unit that will fit our existing microscope.  Similarly, the camera retrofitting is only possible using the PerkinElmer technology.  Other commercial vendors do not have a technology that will enable upgrading of the spinning disk model so as to enable the analyses we require. To buy a new system would cost over $400,000 since it would require purchase of new lasers, and a new confocal and dichroics.  

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This modification to Market Research W909MY-09-Q-0004 is issued to correct the due date for submissions, as specified above.  Submissions are due on 21 May 2009.  Please see complete announcement below:<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Contracting Command  CECOM Contracting Center, Washington Sector, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications-Electronics Research, Development, and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Countermine Division is conducting market research under Request for Information (RFI) W909MY-09-Q-0004, to identify companies having technology, qualifications, and capabilities to demonstrate ground vehicle mounted search radar with the capabilities to detect wire (single or multi-strand and various gauges), surface laid, near and extending from roadways.  Specifically, the goal of the market research is to identify companies with prior experience and the ability to rapidly mature and demonstrate search type radar technologies to detect surface laid wire near and extending from roadways.  Sensor mounted ground vehicles may include the Highly Mobile Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) at speeds up to 15 kph.  For this market research, search radar technologies include variations of fully polarimetric, or HH polarity operating at X-band (8 - 12 GHz) or higher frequencies, with a bandwidth of at least 500 MHz, having a minimum near range limit of 10 meters, real or synthetic aperture generated at least once per second, vertical beam spread of 17 degrees or greater, horizontal beam spread of 4 degrees or less.  Search radar sensor data or output data stream must be defined and available for subsequent processing by the Government.  Maturity for this market survey is defined as having a minimum technology readiness (TRL) level of 7, or a clear path to demonstrate a TRL 7 or greater within 6 months.  Technically mature, TRL 7 or higher, detection systems are being sought which have capability to provide detection performance at standoff ranges required by Coalition and Partner Nation military forces that conduct route clearance missions.  The detection systems will be expected to be able to detect a wide variety of electrically conductive thin strain wire or wires which are surface laid, across, parallel and extending away from improved or unimproved roads for a distance of up to approximately 500 meters.  <BR><BR>Sources possessing the capabilities to satisfy this requirement are invited to submit a ten (10) page White Paper providing a description of their system.  The White Paper shall include, at a minimum:<BR><BR>a.  Device name, brief description of technology, and system specifications (including relevant parameters such as bandwidth, resolution, field of regard, range, etc.);  <BR><BR>b. Types of wire that the system can detect and, if available, estimated probabilities of detection and false alarms for the different wire emplacements under realistic clutter environments and identify expected sources of interferences/false alarms;   <BR><BR>c. Estimated standoff range (sensor to target) and description of proposed remote operation;   <BR>d. Known limitations for wire detection applications (e.g. cannot penetrate 1 cm of dry soil, cannot penetrate 1 cm of moist/wet soil, cannot detect non-electrically conductive strands, etc.);   <BR><BR>e. Other agency testing performed to date, estimated TRL, points of contact and phone numbers for references;   <BR><BR>f. Other agency purchase or field trials to date, points of contact, phone numbers and email addresses for references;  <BR><BR>g. Size and weight of device; <BR><BR>h. Power requirements; <BR><BR>i. Environmental requirements; <BR><BR>j. Unit cost at less than 10 units and 150 unit quantities;  <BR><BR>k. Electrical safety and RF emission compliance (Indicate if system is DoD 1494 RF spectrum approved/compliant); <BR><BR>l. Concepts of operation; <BR><BR>m. Estimated rate of advance in search mode (km/hr) and coverage rate (square km/hr); <BR><BR>n. Please state whether or not your company is considered a small business or a large business. If you are a small business, please also indicate if you are an 8(a), HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned business; <BR><BR>o. If you hold a GSA Schedule contract (874 or other), please provide the Schedule number.  <BR>Each respondent should also provide point of contact information to include:  company name, contact name, company Address, website (if applicable), contact phone number, and contact email address.  <BR><BR>This notice is provided for information only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to pay for information submitted nor will the Government return any data provided.  It is desirable that data be received with unlimited rights to the Government.  However, it is recognized that proprietary data may be included with the information provided.  If so, clearly mark such proprietary information and clearly separate it from the unrestricted information as an addendum.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of this market research nor of the merits of the information they provide.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received.  The information will be used to support urgent, on-going, initiatives within the Department of Defense to analyze emerging requirements for Coalition and Partner Nation systems and may ultimately result in the Government developing and issuing a RFP. <BR><BR>Responses should be submitted no later than 4:00 PM EST. on 21 May 2009.  Responses should be emailed to Sabin Joseph, Contract Specialist, sabin.joseph@us.army.mil with a copy to jay.a.marble@us.army.mil.  The subject of the email message shall be:  W909MY-09-Q-0004, Market Research Response, Your Companys Name.  All questions of a technical nature should be addressed to Dr. Jay Marble, Principle Investigator, at jay.a.marble@us.army.mil.

<DESC>RATIONALE FOR A CONTRACT ACTION THAT IS NOT BOTH, FIXED-PRICE AND COMPETITIVE AS REQUIRED BY FAR SUBPART 5.7 - PUBLICIZING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINSVESTMENT ACT OF 2009. Type of Contract Action: SBA 8(a) non competitive contract modification identified in FPDS-NG as HUDCCHI00848, M0004.  This modification was issued on April 13, 2009 for a firm fixed price of $64,506. The description of the contract is for HUD USER and Regulatory Barriers Website Operations to exercise option-to-extend, a clause already in the contract for 4 months and to add Task 4 - Mapping System for the Neighborhood Stabilization Program Competition.  Sage Computing, Inc. will install a mapping system on the existing HUD USER web server and provide maintenance and support for a new mapping system for four months after installation.  Sage will provide the necessary hardware, software, programming and verification services to add the mapping functionality. This work is within the scope of the contract. The HUD Policy Development and Research (PD&R) Branch had an immediate need for these services in regards to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) and requested the assistance of the HUD Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO). The request was to quickly add a new task so the current HUDUSER and Regulatory Barriers Website Operations contractor (Sage Computing, Inc.) to support  the Recovery Act programs requiring a competition in the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP).

<p>c. Period of Performance:<br />One (1) base year and one 3&frac12; month option period. Total performance period = 15 &frac12; months.<br /><br />4. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br /><br />41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (3) (A)</p>
<p>a. Reason authority cited:<br />It is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to maintain a national market, facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing property or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization.</p>
<p><br />5. REASONS TO JUSTIFY OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:</p>
<p>a. Background:<br />When stockpiled vaccines are called into use for emergency outbreaks or vaccine supply disruptions, they must be viable for administration. The CDC pediatric stockpiled vaccines are held at the manufacturers' facilities in a storage and rotation system that makes it possible to rotate stock efficiently and thus minimize CDC's cost and risk resulting from vaccine that would otherwise expire. These shelf-life concerns are exclusively addressed by the manufacturer because the manufacturer has the market to rotate older stockpiled vaccines into operating inventory before expiration, and to continually replenish stockpiled vaccines with fresh vaccine produced more recently by them.</p>
<p>b. Alternatives:<br />No known alternatives.</p>
<p>c. Justification: <br />All of the stockpiled vaccine is manufactured by Merck.<br />To our knowledge there is no other manufacturer of these particular vaccines meeting the requirements for storage and rotation set forth by the FDA.<br /><br />d. Impact:<br />Allowing the vaccine manufacturer to store and rotate the stockpiled vaccines keeps CDC's purchased vaccines viable for use year after year. CDC would need to re-purchase vaccines upon expiration if they could not be continuously rotated out into the market.</p>
<p><br />6. ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION FOR SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS OF THIS TYPE:</p>
<p>Without the capability for an organization to rotate the vaccines into the market and then replace those rotated vaccines with fresh vaccines it could not most efficiently and effectively manage CDC's pediatric vaccine stockpile program. Another key aspect is that even if an organization could rotate the product into the market place, unless it was the vaccine manufacturer performing the rotations, that organization would not be able to replenish the rotated vaccines with a more fresh vaccine without CDC re-purchasing the vaccines.</p>
<p>7. MARKET RESEARCH</p>
<p>A vaccine manufacturer, under our contract terms and conditions, will maintain the potency and freshness of the vaccines by storing the vaccines and rotating them when they get close to expiration and then replacing those rotated vaccines at no additional charge to the Federal Government and thereby maintaining our CDC pediatric vaccine stockpile in the most effective and efficient manner possible.</p>
<p>Merck is the only organization that has the full, optimal, market to store and rotate the product, in the quantities that we want stored and rotated. If CDC selected another vendor to store and rotate the vaccines being held in CDC's pediatric vaccine stockpiles, those entities would not have the market size in which to fully rotate the quantities of product and therefore CDC would not be able to store the selected vaccine quantities. The ability to rotate the product is a key aspect for the selection of the organization storing CDC's vaccines.</p>
<p><br />8. INTERESTED SOURCES:<br />The only interested source for procurement is identified as:</p>
<p>Merck<br />Attn: XXXXXXXXX<br />770 Sumney Town Pike<br />West Point, PA 119486</p>
<p><br />9. SIGNATURES ARE REQUIRED BELOW:</p>
<p>I have reviewed this JOFOC and certify the justification is adequate to support other than full and open competition.<br /><br />_____'S'______________________________ _____________________________<br />PROJECT OFFICER (PO) DATE</p>
