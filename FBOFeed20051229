FIPS 201/HSPD-12 impacts on legacy access control systems in GSA Region 9

 The General Services Administration Region 9, requires a technical scope of work to be written that would be used to solicit comprehensive vendor proposals for a complete interdisciplinary technical study that examines the full technical impacts of Federal Information Processing Standard 201/Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (FIPS 201/HSPD-12), on the legacy building access control systems currently operated by the Public Building Service in Region 9.   This RFI is intended to identify vendor interest and capability to perform this study and identify an integrated methodology and approach.

  Prior to FIPS 201, building access control systems, credentialing  and other smart card based systems, and high level Information Technology (IT) Security implementations (Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and identity management) were represented by separate vendor segments and not uniformly treated as building systems nor as part of IT.   The scope of work for this study to include but is not limited to: recommendations and strategy for replacing, updating or supplementing existing systems plus the implementation of new systems to be operated in fully interoperable FIPS 201 environment; cost estimates; development of a standard construction scope of work for use in solicitations including related building security recommendations, impacts on other building systems etc; examination of models for IT operation of such systems and organizational operation alternatives; development of suggested proposal evaluation rating scheme.  

 Environment: more than 900 GSA managed, owned and leased locations in California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and the Pacific Trust territories.  Operational responsibility for these locations is divided into 4 Service Centers, which currently operate 100+ legacy access control systems, primarily proximity systems which operate on a stand-alone basis. 

(Would it be possible to conduct a sampling of (Los Angeles Service Center – for example), buildings to determine the status of existing installed equipment for a basis of design and standardization?)
 
 Objective: To ultimately provide a totally interoperable/secure solution (design & installation) for access control systems based on FIPS 201/Smart Card Technology.  These systems must be compatible with the current (and future), GSA National Identification smart cards issued by the GSA National Identification Program.  As applied to physical access, these smart cards will be used for personal identification and smart card authentication.  

 Known considerations for inclusion in the scope of work in the building security and IT arenas are listed below.  All other FIPS 201 considerations are desired for inclusion.

 Known Considerations - Building Access Control Systems:

1.	Wiring: copper- shielded or unshielded; use of conduit; fiber; RFI interference, magnetic interference concerns, issues. Applicability of ANSI/EIA/TIA 568A Commercial Building Telecommunications Standards for cabling and routing. 
2.	Protocols: Physical/data link- Ethernet, token bus or ring, proprietary; Network – IP, proprietary, routing infrastructure. Transport- UDP, TCP, proprietary. Ethernet, TCP/IP, private address ranges.
3.	Communication Encryption – backend systems to readers, controllers, end points.
4.	Wide area network (interconnection of access control systems): private network, encrypted traffic on corporate WAN, VPN.
5.	Controllers: building location, protection, access, collocation in Telco closets.
6.	Computer Platform: Operating System- Windows, UNIX, Linux. Consolidation on a single platform and vendor environment.
7.	Configuration and Security: Connection to other access control systems, networks, virus protection, OS upgrades, users, rights.
8.	Connection and alarm interface to other building systems: Fire, CCTV, access control, perimeter alarm, elevator controls.
9.	Connection and interface to legacy access control systems, credentialing/badge systems.
10.	Backup and Recovery: Redundant back-end systems; off-site disaster recovery & alternate site location; system backup offsite media rotation.
11.	Environmental: emergency power, ventilation, UPS protection, entry and protection of all access control system components – readers, controllers, 
12.	Potential use of PBS IT information infrastructure and data center operations, for possible device co-location and disaster recovery.
13.	PKI: options and recommendation for certificate and key exchange between building access control system(s) - (e.g. network, tokens) and Public Key Infrastructure.  (GSA PKI solution and use of Federal Certificate Bridge Authority is neither defined nor scheduled.)
14.	Evaluation of the applicability of existing Federal IT Security Requirements to FIPS 201 interoperable building access control system: FISMA, system planning, certification, capital planning etc. 
15.	Section 508 compliance for systems.
16.	Temporary and Visitor card issuance at specific locations. Credential/card production of a card that provides access to a specific building access control system but will not interoperate with any other FIPS 201 system.
17.	Organizational issues: organizational definition, roles, responsibilities for operating FIPS 201 interoperable building access control systems in a building operational environment.

<DESC>The GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural/engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals.  All projects will be LEED-EB certified.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project involves the modernization of the HVAC systems and the installation of a sprinkler system throughout the Minton-Capehart Federal Building.  Architect/Engineering (A/E) design services and preparation of design documents are required for this renovation project.  Built in 1974, the Minton-Capehart Federal Building is located at 575 North Pennsylvania Street in Indianapolis, Indiana.  The Minton-Capehart building is a Modernist six story building with a ground floor below grade, a mechanical mezzanine above grade, and a penthouse above the core area of the sixth floor.  Attached to the building is a two-level parking facility.  The prime objectives of this project include, but are not limited to:  1) upgrading the HVAC systems to improve indoor air quality throughout the building; 2) reducing energy consumption using more efficient equipment and controls; 3) improving the safety of the building occupants and reducing the loss of property in the event of a fire.  It is anticipated the project delivery method will include the procurement of a Construction Manager (constructor) (CMc) in order to review both the constructability and cost of the project as the design is developed.  The project will be phased and the building will be occupied during construction.
SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural, engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for verification of existing systems and conditions, concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), document preparation to be used in providing clear direction to the CM team, as well as possible post-construction contract services (PCCS) that may include shop drawing review and approval, construction inspection, and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government.
For the Minton-Capehart Federal Office Building, the scope of design work as it relates to the planned modernization and renovation would include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: (1) survey of existing conditions; (2) detailed scope verification; (3) energy conservation analysis; (4) complete architectural and engineering design; (5) preparation of specifications and CADD drawings for construction documents; (6) value engineering; (7) costs analysis; (8) post-construction contract services (PCCS); (8) record drawings and construction phase A/E inspection services.  
Throughout the design process, the selected lead designer and A/E will assist the Government in identifying those elements of work that can be accomplished within the Congressionally-mandated cost limitation for the project.  The scope of Construction work to be covered in the design, as it relates to the planned modernization and renovation will include, but not be limited to, the following:  (1)  refurbish the air-handling units for greater airflow to provide the recommended minimum amount of fresh air for each occupant and improve the total air circulation; (2)  replace the fiberglass branch distribution ductwork and diffusers to handle greater airflows and eliminate contamination from glass fiber in the environmental air, (3)  replace the stair pressurization fans with larger fans that will produce the necessary pressures and airflows; (4)  provide a new direct digital control (DDC) temperature control system for energy efficiency; (5)  provide additional commissioning of the system and other improvements for LEED-EB certification; (6)  utilize the existing dry standpipe risers in the stairs as a part of a new sprinkler system; (7)  provide sprinkler protection extending from the mains to each space in the building; (8)  provide a new fire pump and jockey pump, installed in the ground floor mechanical room, to boost the pressure for the new sprinkler system; (9)  provide new lay-in ceilings, repair hard ceilings, and replace lighting throughout the building with modular wiring and automatic controls for lower maintenance costs, easier adds and moves, and greater energy efficiency.  
GSA is in the process of evaluating federal buildings of the 1950s through the 1970s.  The lead designer and A/E shall identify, assess, and preserve character-defining features and attributes of the original design.  Design changes are to be well-integrated and compatible with the original design so that the building retains its architectural character.  A lead designer and A/E shall work with GSA’s regional historic preservation staff to determine potential effects to these features and attributes due to proposed alterations.  The project will meet GSA design standards for secure facilities, conform to the P100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), include LEED-EB certification; and respond to customer agency requirements.
SELECTION PROCESS
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms with a lead designer/engineer interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The lead designer/engineer is the individual or the team of designers and engineers who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept and the project design.
A/E firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed in the within the State of Indiana.  The A/E firms will address the contractual relationship with the lead designer/engineer and project team in Stage II.  They will also demonstrate how the geographically-mandated contracts will be accomplished in Stage II.  Any arrangement toward the geographically-mandated contract goal must be in place prior to the submittal of Stage II information.
The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows:  In Stage I, interested lead designer/engineers and associated A/E firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the lead designer/engineer-design firm.  In STAGE II, short-listed lead designer/engineer-A/E firms and representatives from their team will be interviewed.
STAGE I
All documentation will be in an 8 ½” x 11” format.  The assembled Stage I portfolio should be no more than ¼ inch thick.  Submissions may be double-sided where feasible.  The portfolio should included the following: a cover letter referencing that FedBizOpps announcement and briefly describing the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Part II dated no earlier than 12 months from the date of this synopsis; and responses to the submission requirements and evaluation criteria listed below. The SF 330 may be obtained from http://www.gsa.fov.forms.far.htm.  SF254 and SF255 Forms will not be accepted.  An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer and GSA professionals will evaluate the submissions. The board will establish a shortlist of three to six firms. The shortlist will be based on the A/E Design Firm’s submittal in response to this Request for Qualifications.  The A/E Design Firm will provide specific evidence of its capabilities to deliver Design Excellence within the context of large complex renovation projects and will express its design approach and philosophy.
Identification of team members, other than the lead designer(s) is not required at this stage.  Consultant and “production firm” (if different from the design firm) information should not be included in the Stage I portfolio.

Indian Head has solicited on November 9, 2005 and received proposals on December 9, 2005 under the Naval Sea Systems Command Seaport-enhanced multi-award contract, solicitation N00024-06-R-3057.

Questions should be address to Ms. Penny Kennedy at 301-744-6626. Note 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement

The purpose of the modification is to cover additional cost for the completion of the required services which is expected to end August 2006. This modification will allow William Rudman Associates to continue to conduct administrative investigations and prepare proposal for personnel action.  The administrative investigations will require William Rudman Associates to continue to develop interview questions, travel to NIH to conduct interviews with witnesses, and teleconference with NIH officials throughout the investigation, prepare witness statements, and provide recommendations to NIH officials.  Pending the outcome of the administrative investigations, should a personnel action be warranted, William Rudman Associates will prepare the document for NIH Officials. If a hearing is required, William Rudman Associates will assist the Departments legal representative in presenting the case.  Considering that this is a continuation of an existing request an award to any other source would affect the NIH’s anticipated outcome based upon  William Rudman Associates, knowledge in this on going requirement, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.   The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the Size Standard is $6.0M. The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<DESC>Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is a non-immunologic reaction elicited by the direct action of a chemical substance on the skin.  Both extrinsic and intrinsic factors influence the development of this adverse condition.  ICD is the most common work-related skin disease and the second most common cause of occupational-related health problems.  
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, National Institute for Occupations Safety and Health (NIOSH) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with  Case Western University to perform Phase 2 for professional services to determine underlying mechanism differences in susceptibility to skin irritants in Health Care Workers.  
This project is currently supported by a justification for other than full and open competition to Case Western University under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(3).  This project represents Phase 2 for data collection using patch tests on human subjects.  
Case Western has a unique professional expertise in this field.   They have a critical mass in immunology and dermatology with worldwide known expertise in the areas of dermatitis/eczema and contact dermatitis.  They have patch testing services available for specialized evaluation and education, and also have unique expertise in the evaulation of environmental and occupation-induced dermatitis.  Their dedicated Skin Studies Center is equipped with noninvasive advanced skin assessment methodologies such as skin ultrasound, photography, image analysis and Transepidermal Water Loss.  Case Western has already obtained Institutional Review Board approval for the Protection of Human Research Subjects (IRB) to perform this effort.   
This announcement is being issued for information purposes only; a request for quotations is not available.  Consideration of an alternate source would require a capabilities statement which demonstrates in writing that:  1)  the organization possesses the expertise of highly qualified dermatologists and immunologist to conduct the protocol;  2)  the organization has access to adequate volunteer populations of health care workers (nurses, physicians, and technicians), with no existing skin dieases, who wash their hands at least 8 times a day;  3) the organization can  identify a previous collaboration where data was collected using the techniques described in this protocol which could be used for comparison;  and  4) the ability to obtain Institutional Review Board approval for the Protection of Human Research Subjects (IRB) to perform this effort in a timeframe that would not delay the work. 
Capabilities shall contain no more than 5 pages total and must be received within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  Submit written information to:  Brenda Goodwin, MS-1019, Reference:   MGW-2006-4,  DHHS/PHS, CDC, 1095 Willowadle Road, Morgantown, WV  26505, or responses may be submitted electronically to Brenda Goodwin at BCG1@cdc.gov.
Information received will be used solely  for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, a solicitation  will be issued to the Case Western University.  All responses shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>B--Requirements Development and Rapid Prototyping Testbed (RDRaPT) Request for Information (RFI)
<SOLNBR>W91QUZ06R0XXX
<RESPDATE>022006
<ARCHDATE>04212006
<CONTACT>Neal Dedicatoria, 703-325-3038
<DESC>Requirements Development and Rapid Prototyping Testbed (RDRaPT) Request for Information (RFI) Closing Date: 20 February 2006. The Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS); Project Officer for the Acquisition Domain (PO AD) Combat Development Integration Cell (CDIC) in partnership with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army Acquisition, Logi stics, and Technology (OASA(ALT)) is seeking industry information on available protocols, products, and technologies to facilitate the rapid defining of processes, requirements, and technologies to improve the way the Army acquisition domain conducts its b usiness.    Sources sought are requested to address available, processes, products, and technologies to provide a complete capability to rapidly define requirements within the Army Acquisition business process domain, and to prototype technologies that can  offer significant improvement.  The proposed solution must have the capability to produce data to help quantify the value improvement of those technologies or process changes. The analysis may cover the current policies, procedures, and tools used through out the acquisition lifecycle, from cradle to grave. The ultimate goal of this RFI is to identify expertise and knowledge in rapid prototyping processes and tools that can be utilized to facilitate requirements definization, technology exploration, and cost benefit analysis.  The optimum response will provid e useful information about state of the art technologies and tools, a high level implementation plan, and a proven track record in delivering this capability to industry or government organizations.   Background:   In an effort to streamline the current acquisition processes and to posture the Army for continued transformation, the OASA (ALT) and related activities have undertaken a review of their current business practices and supporting technologies.  This effort is concurrent with the Business Management Modernization Program, the Department of Defenses overarching initiative to assess business areas for efficiency and effectiveness, associated portfolio management activities, and the ability to meet and support the transformation requirements as defined in Joint vision 2020. The ASA(ALT) and PEO EIS have been directed to implement a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) as the framework for enhancing the business of Army Acquisition.  This SOA will provide the infrastructure through which enterprise net-centric business systems will enable domain elements to create, manage and share the information and information management resources necessary to enable more efficient and effective business processes.   The Acquisition Domain will soon establish the Future Business System (FBS) Program responsible for developing and fielding the SOA and the suite of enterprise net-centric business tools that will continuously evolve to provide improving and more efficient business support to the domain. However, the Acquisition community has little experience with Service Oriented Architectures, net-centric systems, and shared data spaces.  Although there is a clear requirement for secure information, interoperable systems, agile business processes and pr actices, and greater efficiency in the creation, management and sharing of information, there is no clarity in what improvements are possible, what technology can enable, or how to state clear requirements for enhanced business capabilities.   Description:   To overcome this problem, the domain is seeking to explore the use of a requirements development and technology prototyping test-bed.  This test-bed will provide a mechanism to bring users together with state-of-the-art information management technologies in a mock SOA environment to enable rapid prototyping of process changes and exploration of technology options.  PEO EIS is looking for industry ideas on how such a requirements development and material prototypin g test-bed could be accomplished.  The PEO is seeking information on how such a test-bed might be designed, operated and/or matured so as to provide the desired support to the Future Business System Program.  Information sought would include technical appr oaches, information on previous experience with similar approaches, and draft scenarios that can be used to validate each proposed approach. This requirement applies to all elements of the acquisition domain.  It applies directly to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASA (ALT)), its Field Operating Agencies (FOAs), Direct Reporting Program Managers ( DPMs), Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and subordinate PMs.  It also applies to those organizations not directly reporting to the ASA (ALT), but which have a substantial role in the planning, management, and/or execution of the life-cycle management proc ess defined by DoD Directive 5000.2.  This includes but is not limited to Test & Evaluation (T&E) Organizations; Army Materiel Command (AMC), Army Laboratories; Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM); and the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA). Additionally, the requirement should address the interface between the anticipated Future Business System and the other enterprise systems across the Army and DoD.  The goal is to establish the requirements for the FBS program so that it takes advantage of and works seamlessly with evolving enterprise systems across domain and Service lines and with evolving Net-Centric Enterprise Services and other enterprise services such as AKO. The RDRaPT will be required to support the emulation, manipulation, and experimentation of the following acquisition domain functions; policy management, program management, earned value management, contract management, funds management, systems engineerin g, software acquisition management, test and evaluation, manufacturing and production, and logistics management and other acquisition functions across the life-cycle.  Capabilities: a.  Hardware:   The requirement is for computer hardware and associated peripheral equipment necessary to support the RDRaPT environment.  The proposed solution must explain how DoD information Technology Security Certification requirements will be satisfi ed b.  Software:  The requirement is for the requisite software to simulate, stimulate and emulate acquisition business processes in a service oriented architecture.  This software must be fully supported by the proposed hardware and provide an automated envi ronment to experiment with improved business processes and differing technologies.   c. Documentation:  Relevant documentation of the results, feedback, and data from the RDRaPT is required to document requirements and provide information to perform relevant analysis.  The information should be presented in an easily understood format and should not require significant data reduction efforts.     d. Data:  All data flowing through the RDRaPT should be in accordance with industry best standards and the government financial data standard or other government data standards.  e. Interfaces/Edge resources:  The RDRaPT must take into account edge resources and domain interfaces.  It must provide the ability to show the interface points and have the ability to provide full duplex data exchanges at these points.     PEO EIS is looking for suppliers who can provide an integrated capability that incorporates the above capabilities.  All respondents are asked to provide the following: 1.	A technical description of potential solution(s) or complete capability.  The description should answer the following questions: a.	What part of the overall capability your solution addresses? b.	How does your solution work?  What are its limits? c.	What are the physical dimensions of the environment?   d.	How effectively has your solution been used in the past or related applications? e.	What evidence exists that your solution is applicable if it has not been specifically used for this type of work? f.	How mature is your system?  Is it new development?  Does a prototype exist?  Is it similar to previous successful developments?  Is it an extension or evolution of an existing product?  g.	A schedule estimate from contract award to operational capability for each proposed solution. 2.	A high level cost estimate of establishing the environment and any associated costs with running the RDRaPT . 3.	Recommendations where outcomes can be traded for reduced costs or where enhancements can be added for little or no cost. RFI Purpose and Limitations: The Governments intention is to better understand the current state-of-the-art and to determine the best acquisition approach.  Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all ideas received from industry.  This RFI is an expression of the Governments interest only and does not obligate the Government to pay for the requested information nor respond to any submissions.  Proprietary information is not being solicited; however, if it is submitted, it should be appr opriately marked.

<DESC>The objective of the Aircrew Laser Eye Protection (ALEP) Block 2 program is to develop, manufacture, field, and sustain a system that will provide Air Force aircrew members protection against laser devices/systems in combat, in military operations other than war, and in training situations while minimizing visual performance degradation.  Aircrews will employ the ALEP Block 2 whenever laser devices (e.g., weapons, rangefinders, and designators) are likely to be employed by US, Allied, or unfriendly forces.  ALEP Block 2 will protect against invisible and visible laser wavelengths from both threats and hazardous equipment.  ALEP Block 2 must also be compatible with aircrew life support equipment (LSE) and provide prescription capability.  Multiple ALEP devices may be required because of the challenges imposed by laser protection versus luminous transmittance challenges, or because of the limitations due to LSE physical compatibility challenges.   When the technology allows, the protection offered by the ALEP Block 2 will be changed during production upon notification by HQ ACC/XO of an emerging threat.  When the technology allows, the production process should allow the capability for changes in the wavelength protection of ALEP Block 2 to counter an emerging threat as determined by HQ ACC/XO.

The ALEP Block 2 program is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program.  The Air Force’s acquisition strategy is to enter into Full and Open Competition for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD)/Production phase(s).

<DESC>The evaluation criteria and performance specification have been changed.  Please see Amendment 03 that is posted to this website.

All quotes will be evaluated based on Technical, Past Performance, and Price.   The Technical and Past Performance evaluation factors are significantly more important than Price.   Technical is more important than Past Performance.  This Award will be made on a Best Value basis.  Award may be made to other than the lowest priced technically acceptable quote.  The Government, at its discretion, may award this purchase order without discussions.  

The following evaluation factors will be utilized:

A. GO/NO-GO FACTORS:

The Government will not evaluate any quotes that do not meet the following GO/NO-GO Factors:

1.  Able to achieve operating pressure of 10,000 PSI;
2.  Able to maintain pressure for a minimum of 72 hrs within 2 percent of the target within the full operating range of the system;
3.  Test Volume minimum size of 18 inches in diameter x 66 inches long/tall;
4.  Constructed to National Board Registered and ASME Certified Conditions; and 
5.  Design provides for safety of users (addressed in proposal).

B. NON-COST EVALUATION FACTORS:

The Government will evaluate quotes based on the following non-cost factors:

1. TECHNICAL.
Quotes will be reviewed to evaluate the offeror’s understanding of the requirement and capability to provide the best system that compliments long term program objectives.  The sub-factors for this major factor include:  
i. Long Term Maintenance:  This sub-factor will evaluate the ease of operation and maintenance; availability of parts/materials for repairs; required skills needed to perform maintenance; warranty terms and conditions; maintenance service agreement terms and conditions; and environmental disposal considerations. 
ii. Safety: This sub-factor will evaluate operator shielding; interlock equipment and overrides; and ability to be locked out.
iii. Operations/Testing:  This sub-factor will evaluate operational test and maintenance procedures/inspections; ease of use; cycle time; data logging capability/time series/diagnostics; and the number of cable penetrations/flexibility.
iv. Delivery Schedule:  This sub-factor will evaluate the speed of delivery of the system.
2.  PAST PERFORMANCE.   
The Government is seeking to determine whether the Offeror consistently delivers quality services in a timely manner.  This factor will be evaluated on the basis of relevant past performance for each Offeror and proposed teaming partners, during the last three years, on contracts/purchase orders consistent in scope and complexity with the objectives of this Request for Quote.  The information presented in the Offeror’s quote, together with information from any other sources available to the Government (i.e., Government-controlled Contractor performance databases, Inspector General reports, General Accounting Office reports, newspaper articles, references including contractual, technical, and end-user representatives, etc.) will provide the input for evaluation of this factor.

<DESC>This announcement amends NRL-Wide BAA05-01 posted on Dec 30, 2004 by restating the list of BAA topics valid through 31 December 2006, noting topic cancellations and revisions. The Naval Research Laboratory is interested in receiving innovative proposals that offer potential for advancement and improvement in the technical topic areas listed. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.302(d) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. This BAA is a continuously open announcement valid through 31 December 2006. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. Awards make take the form of a contract, grant or cooperative agreement. Multiple awards are anticipated. NRL encourages Educational Institutions, Small Businesses (SBs), Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns (SDBs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) to submit proposals under this BAA. In order to conserve valuable offeror and Government resources, prospective offerors shall first submit an initial proposal, including a rough cost estimate, to the technical point of contact for each topic. Prospective offerors are encouraged to submit initial proposals as early in the fiscal year as possible to maximize the potential for award. The selection of proposals for award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to each BAA. The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal. Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation. Selection of proposals for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds.

<ARCHDATE>12292006
<CONTACT>Fred Powers Contract Specialist 9169785140     fpowers@mp.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation is issuing this announcement to identify potential certified HUBZone and/or 8(a) Small Business concerns who would be interested in performing construction work at Stony Gorge Dam.  Stony Gorge Dam and Reservoir are part of the Orland Project in Northern California.  The dam is located on Stony Creek, about 21 miles northwest of Willows, California.  The dam was completed in 1928, with modifications performed in 1985-86.  Stony Gorge is an Ambursen-type dam comprised of 46 bays of slab and buttress construction, with buttresses spaced on 18 feet centers.  The dam has a structural height of 139 feet and a crest length of 868 feet at crest elevation 847.0.  Stony Gorge Dam is classified as a high-hazard facility due to the potential for downstream loss of life in the event of failure. The proposed construction work on Stony Gorge consists of a structural modification to address known seismic and hydrologic deficiencies of the dam.  The work incorporates simply supported reinforced concrete diaphragm walls cast between the downstream buttress walls.  The work will require unwatering and excavation under of the downstream face of the dam, drilling, installation, and grouting of concrete anchors in the existing buttress walls, forming and placing reinforced concrete diaphragm walls between the existing buttress walls under the dam.  The work will require the contractor to job fabricate special forms and material handling systems to meet the restricted access under the downstream portion of the dam.  Some of the work will be performed under the existing spillway slab.  This work has limited access.  The dam and associated land has limited work, staging and stockpile areas.  The contractor will be required to meet various environmental restrictions during performance of the work.  The upstream reservoir water surface will be lowered for construction purposes during the late summer and fall months.  The dam crest right of the spillway control house is designed for overtopping.  The top of active conservation storage in the reservoir is elevation 841.0.  Release facilities at the dam include a spillway, outlet work and power plant.  The power plant will remain in service during the performance of the work.   All work required to be performed and completed within 1100 calendar days from the date of issuance of the Notice to Proceed.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 and the related small business size standard in millions of dollars is $28.5.  However, the government reserves the right to change the classification if deemed necessary.  The estimated dollar magnitude of this project is anticipated to be more than $10,000,000.  All letters of interest and qualifications shall be submitted in hard copy no later than the close of business on January 20, 2006.  Should you have any technical questions, contact Mr. Richard Welsh at (530) 934-7066.  It is anticipated that award of the work will occur in July 2006.   The procurement method will be best value in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations PART 15.  Two of the technical factors that will be used to evaluate the offerors are:  1) Technical approach for the work including a detailed resource-loaded schedule and 2) Past experience and performance in constructing or rehabilitation of concrete dams within the past 5 years.  This procurement will require 100% performance and payment bonds.   Interested parties should include the following information in their response:  (a) Business name, address, cage code, size classification based on NAICS size standard, socioeconomic classification (i.e. HUBZone), and a point of contact.  (b) A copy of the certificate issued by the SBA of your qualifications as a HUBZone small business concern.  (c) A positive statement of your intention to submit an offer for this solicitation as a prime contractor.  (d) Evidence of your Bonding capacity and (e) Evidence of your experience performing work similar in type and scope to include:  contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts and points of contacts with telephone numbers and past experience regarding the construction or rehabilitation of concrete dams of similar type work described above within the past 5 years.  In addition, include attachments cataloging the company's equipment assets, personnel resources and financial resources that demonstrate company responsibility and capability to perform required work.  This notice is not a request for proposal and the information presented in this announcement will not obligate the Bureau of Reclamation in any manner.  This procurement is being considered for 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns; however, all interested parties are requested to respond.  If adequate interest or sufficient supporting documentation is not received from HUBZone concerns, the solicitation may be issued as a small business set-aside or unrestricted basis without further notice or may be canceled.  Therefore, replies are requested from all interested parties, regardless of business size or category.  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this notice, by U.S. Mail Service, FedEx, etc. (no electronic mail service will be accepted), on company letter head not later than the close of business on January 20, 2006 to Fred Powers-MP-3816, U.S. Dept of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Mid-Pacific Region, Acquisition Services, 2800 Cottage Way, Room E-1815, Sacramento, California 95825-1898.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102, apply to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Information on annual Representations and Certifications can be obtained via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  The Government plans to offer any interested contractors an opportunity to visit the site and view two preliminary drawings prior to submitting their letter of interest and experience qualifications.  Interested contractors are to contact Mr. Richard Welsh, (530) 934-7066, to make arrangements for this site visit.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Consumables for DNA Sequencing Using ABI PRISM 3730XL DNA Analyzer Instruments
<SOLNBR>NHLBI-PB(HG)-2006-049-KLW
<RESPDATE>011306
<ARCHDATE>01282006

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is conducting a market survey to determine if there are commercial small businesses capable of providing support to the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) through the purchase of consumables for fluorescent DNA sequencing using ABI PRISM 3730XL DNA Analyzer instruments.  The basic research laboratories and clinical branches develop and use the most advanced techniques to conduct molecular genetics research. The NIH Intramural DNA Sequencing program has developed and released capillary-based sequencing instruments that employ automated stackers for continuous loading of plates. These highly sensitive instruments are revolutionizing large-scale DNA sequencing. After careful and systematic investigation, NIH has made a major commitment to utilize the instrument recently released by Applied Biosystems, called the ABI 3730XL DNA Analyzer. To date, a purchase of twelve ABI 3730 instruments has been made and the instruments are being used on a 24 hour basis in production.

The purchase of a standard suite of consumables that are required for use on the ABI 3730 instruments to perform DNA sequencing can be broadly divided into four major categories: 

(1) Capillary arrays (the small, thread-like pieces of glass-like material into which the matrix and DNA samples are injected for separation)

(2) Separation matrix (the material injected into the capillaries for separating DNA fragments; called ‘POP’ matrix by Applied Biosystems)

(3) Running buffer (a specially formulated salt solution for performing DNA electrophoresis)

(4) Fluorescent sequencing reaction mixes (BigDye Terminators)

Based on the anticipated DNA sequencing program at NISC, large amounts of each of these four classes of consumables will be required. This requirement is intended to allow NISC the ability to purchase sufficient quantities of the above consumables for using their set of ABI 3730 instruments to meet their DNA sequencing production goals. Note that the above four classes of consumables capture the general range of materials required for using the ABI 3730 instrument for large-scale DNA sequencing. Because the instrument is so new and because the technology of fluorescent-based DNA sequencing is constantly evolving, improved consumables are routinely introduced by Applied Biosystems. Similarly, reformations and variant forms of these consumables, in particular the fluorescent sequencing reactions, are frequently introduced by Applied Biosystems. The intent is to provide NISC the ability to purchase sufficient quantities of consumables required for using their ABI 3730 instruments, including their ability to quickly change the precise consumables purchased when new substitutes or alternatives are offered. 
	
The estimated number of consumables to be supplied are as follows: 1) #4337458 BigDye Terminator Kits (10 each); 2) #4336357 POP 7 Reagent (12 each); 3) #4316357 POP 6 Reagent (20 each); 4) #4316355 POP 4 Reagent (50 each); 5) #4319899 Array for 3100 (10 each); 6) #402824 Running Buffer for 3100 (90 each); and 7) #4335611 POP 7 Reagent (30 each).   All of these consumables are tailored for use on ABI PRISM 3730XL instruments, in most cases with Applied Biosystems owning the patent rights.  Use of the listed consumables must result in the ability to generate high-fidelity sequence data (<1% ambiguous bases over 800 pb reads) using the ABI 3730 instrument.  Sequencing reagents must be capable of using cycle-sequencing protocols with high sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratios starting with minimal amounts (e.g. <100 ng) of starting DNA.  Consumables must be tailored for use on ABI 3730 instruments for performing DNA sequencing.  They must not compromise the warranty or service contract of these instruments.  Additionally, the primer cycle sequencing ready reaction kit must be a single energy transfer molecule using a donor fluorescein and an acceptor dichlororhodamine coupled by a highly efficient energy transfer linker to give the brightest signal for the longest read lengths.   This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and one is not currently available.  All interested small businesses, 8(a), Hubzone or disabled veterans are requested to submit capability statements demonstrating their ability to provide the required quantity of consumable items.  The NIH intends to negotiate a one (1) year contract with four (4) subsequent one (1) year options. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 325414.

The capability statements must be submitted not later than January 13, 2006 and must reference number NHLBI-PB(HG)-2006-049/KLW. Four (4) copies of your capability statements should be delivered to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Rockledge Building 2, Room 6137, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attn.: Kesha L. Williams, Contract Specialist.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/ SOURCES SOUGHT (SS) NOTICE LIGHTWEIGHT TRANSPORTABLE SATCOM ANTENNA SYSTEM THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A SOLICITATION. The US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Space and Terrestrial Communication Direct orate (S&TCD) is requesting information from companies that have design/development experience in antenna systems and/or power amplifiers for vehicle-mounted Satellite Communication (SATCOM) systems in the X, Ku, Ka and Q bands. The Government wishes to de termine potential sources for the development of an affordable, lightweight Comm-On-the-Halt (COTH) multiband antenna system for tactical satellite communications.   INTRODUCTION: It is desired that next-generation multiband, transportable COTH antenna systems operate with an increased data rate, while being lighter in weight and potentially smaller than currently fielded systems.  Ease of use and setup are also highly  desired qualities.  This antenna system should be capable of transmitting and receiving via multiple commercial and military satellite systems, including the Wideband Gapfiller Satellite (WGS), commercial Ku Band systems, XTAR, Advanced EHF (AEHF), and Tr ansformational Satellites (TSAT).  If easily accommodated, commercial Ka Band systems may also be of interest.  Simultaneous links to more than one satellite are not required.   The Government is requesting information from Industry to aid in determining the maturity of key technologies to meet these requirements.  It is understood that novel or alternative approaches to the problem may be needed to meet the desired objectives.  P ossible alternative approaches could include, but are not limited to:  shaped dual reflector systems for increased aperture efficiency, bifocal reflectors with two multiband feeds to eliminate manual feed changes, and the incorporation of an additional agi le scan capability (either electronic or mechanical) with limited field of view to assist with antenna pointing.  This information will assist the Government in formulating an acquisition strategy and associated timeline for development of a future antenna  program.  The Government plans to start development of a multiband antenna system in FY07, with an OTM demonstration on Army representative vehicles in FY08 to validate a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 6.  Key areas of interest for this antenna system in clude TWT (Traveling Wave Tube) amplifiers size/power and reliability.  SCOPE: The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to support a possible RFP release for a multiband COTH SATCOM TWT amplifiers, and to determine Industry interest in participating in this effort. The Government will use the information gathered in re sponse to this RFI to gain an understanding of potential approaches to meet COTH SATCOM TWT amplifier requirements. We seek to understand the current state of development that companies have achieved in TWT amplifier designs, as well as various alternative  innovative and creative solutions, and how these might apply to the Government effort to achieve a lightweight, affordable, efficient COTH antenna system to potentially replace the HC3 COTH Phoenix. DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Key areas of interest for this antenna system and amplifiers include the following items.

Participants in the Armor Challenge will be selected based on the criteria listed at the website below.  Selectees will be invited to send test samples of their novel armor designs to Directed Technologies, Inc., (DTI), Arlington, Virginia.  DTI is a Scientific, Engineering and Technical Advisor (SETA) contractor to the Defense Sciences Office and is bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements.  Funding will NOT be provided for Research and Development, but DTI will reimburse selectees for the cost of manufacture and shipping of the samples. Through DTI, DARPA will fund all ballistic testing at an independent laboratory to ensure that armor performance is judged consistently by an objective organization operating with recognized and objective standards.  Samples that demonstrate superior performance against one or more threats, or that incorporate a particularly innovative design feature, will be considered by DARPA for further development.

Details regarding program planning and objectives, as well as guidelines for proposal preparation, submission and evaluation, may be found at the Armor Challenge website, http://www.directedtechnologies.com/DARPA_ArmorChallenge.html.  Proposals will be accepted beginning February 20, 2006, and continuing through August 31, 2006.

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued for the Air Force News Television Breakaway system.  A brief statement of the requirement follows.  Please see attached full Statement of Work.  Proposals will be due no later than 4pm, CST.  Vendor proposals shall be submitted to karen.beyer@gsa.gov by the closing date and time.  Questions concerning the requirement shall be submitted in writing to the same address no later than 1/06/2006.  Vendors wishing to submit a proposal may do so in accordance with the above.  Additionally, interested vendors must be registered in GSA's Information Technology Solutions Shop (ITSS) and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) by the closing date.  ITSS registration can take place at http://it-solutions.gsa.gov.  Failure to comply with these instructions may result in proposals being determined non-responsive.

This combined synopsis/solicition is set aside 100% for small business.

Brief Description of Project:

This Statement of work sets forth the requirements for an integrator to provide and install ten commercially available off-the-shelf multichannel NTSC television break-away/automation systems which are already currently offered for sale to commercial broadcasters and cable system operators.  Each of these systems shall playout eight independent channels and be scalable for future expansion.  These systems will enable American Forces Radio and Television Servcie (AFRTS) manned affiliates at ten geographically separated locations to automatically and manually insert commercial breaks (spot material) into network programming streams and provide long and short form programming throughout a broadcast day in the event that network feeds are lost.

Locations for this contract are:
	Operating Location-A, Detachment 4 AFNEWS, FELTWELL, England
	Detachment 6 AFNEWS, LAJES, Azores
	Detachment 7 AFNEWS, INCIRLIK, Turkey
	Detachment 8 AFNEWS, AVIANO, Italy
	Detachment 9 AFNEWS, SPANGDAHLEM, Germany
	Detachment 10 AFNEWS, YOKOTA (TOKYO), Japan
	Detachment 11 AFNEWS, OKINAWA, Japan
			Detachment 12 AFNEWS, MISAWA, Japan
			Detachment 13 AFNEWS, IWAKUNI, Japan
Detachment 14 AFNEWS, SASEBO, Japan
	 
Each of these locations receives primary programming from the Network headquarters, Defense Media Center-Broadcast Center (DMC-BC), Riverside, California via satellite service to Europe and the Pacific.  There exists in addition to the local automation requirement a requirement for transcoding of material using Anystream Agility to provide product to an automation system already owned by the Government and used in Germany.

4.1.	System Concept
The basic system concept is for the Television Break-away/Automation System to insert local spot breaks and News into the AFRTS program stream.  Schedules for each of the eight channels are provided by Network headquarters, also referred to as the DMC-BC, 3-5 days in advance and indicate the break times or “avails” in which to insert local products. Local manipulation of the scheduled breaks does not normally occur. For the purposes of this document the terms “spot”, “product”, “interstitial material”, “short form” or “long form”  are synonymous in that they refer to television program material produced or recorded in-house for air at a later time.

Our simplified TV automation concept for this award covers three main areas of functionality. 

a.	The Playlist Management System, residing at the User layer, which interfaces to the AFRTS Network schedules. It also plans schedules,  provides reports, and controls the automation software. Ingest plays a prominent role in this area as well.  Most program material will be ingested from Avid Unity® and not controlled by the play-out automation system.  These files will require format conversion to the internal format of the transmission servers.  It is important that this process also writes the metadata required by the automation system so that it can recognize the material once it is ingested.  The automation system shall also be able to control a local VTR to ingest material directly into the transmission servers in the event of failure of either Avid or Contractor Provided transcoder.  

b. The middle applications such as  “automation” software which controls the hardware through machine control servers; “playlist” software which receives commands from both the traffic layer and the automation layer; performs monitoring & tracking function, “database and library” software; and other programs designed to mesh the different areas into a unified delivery system. Transcoding also occurs within this area.
 
c. The hardware  which actually performs transcoding, stores material and streams it to air. For the purposes of this document, playout servers may also be called channel servers, cache, edge, transmission or streaming servers. All storage configurations offered must offer seamless delivery of product in the event of a failure in any portion of the configuration.  It is important to note that total redundancy is a critical evaluation item. Downstream keyers and Character Generator are also located in this area.  Character generator will be used for onscreen messaging on a channel-selectable or all-channels basis. DSK will be used for channel branding.  Both shall be controlled either manually or through the playlist as scheduled events.

4.2.	System Reliability

Guaranteed reliability and protection of media and media delivery streams is a fundamental requirement.  All systems evaluated will be assessed against potential single-points of failure.  All systems will be judged as to the level of media protection, server protection, and software failsafes offered in the basic system.   



POINT OF CONTACT AND GSA PROJECT MANAGER FOR THIS REQUIREMENT IS MRS. KAREN BEYER.  ALL inquiries should be addressed to karen.beyer@gsa.gov.

ITSS registration can take place at http://it-solutions.gsa.gov.  Failure to comply with these instructions may result in proposals being determined non-responsive.

This combined synopsis/solicition is set aside 100% for small business.

Brief Description of Project (for entire Statement of Word please see announcement #7TF-06-0005SOW):

This Statement of work sets forth the requirements for an integrator to provide and install ten commercially available off-the-shelf multichannel NTSC television break-away/automation systems which are already currently offered for sale to commercial broadcasters and cable system operators.  Each of these systems shall playout eight independent channels and be scalable for future expansion.  These systems will enable American Forces Radio and Television Servcie (AFRTS) manned affiliates at ten geographically separated locations to automatically and manually insert commercial breaks (spot material) into network programming streams and provide long and short form programming throughout a broadcast day in the event that network feeds are lost.

Locations for this contract are:
	Operating Location-A, Detachment 4 AFNEWS, FELTWELL, England
	Detachment 6 AFNEWS, LAJES, Azores
	Detachment 7 AFNEWS, INCIRLIK, Turkey
	Detachment 8 AFNEWS, AVIANO, Italy
	Detachment 9 AFNEWS, SPANGDAHLEM, Germany
	Detachment 10 AFNEWS, YOKOTA (TOKYO), Japan
	Detachment 11 AFNEWS, OKINAWA, Japan
			Detachment 12 AFNEWS, MISAWA, Japan
			Detachment 13 AFNEWS, IWAKUNI, Japan
Detachment 14 AFNEWS, SASEBO, Japan
	 
Each of these locations receives primary programming from the Network headquarters, Defense Media Center-Broadcast Center (DMC-BC), Riverside, California via satellite service to Europe and the Pacific.  There exists in addition to the local automation requirement a requirement for transcoding of material using Anystream Agility to provide product to an automation system already owned by the Government and used in Germany.

4.1.	System Concept
The basic system concept is for the Television Break-away/Automation System to insert local spot breaks and News into the AFRTS program stream.  Schedules for each of the eight channels are provided by Network headquarters, also referred to as the DMC-BC, 3-5 days in advance and indicate the break times or “avails” in which to insert local products. Local manipulation of the scheduled breaks does not normally occur. For the purposes of this document the terms “spot”, “product”, “interstitial material”, “short form” or “long form”  are synonymous in that they refer to television program material produced or recorded in-house for air at a later time.

Our simplified TV automation concept for this award covers three main areas of functionality. 

a.	The Playlist Management System, residing at the User layer, which interfaces to the AFRTS Network schedules. It also plans schedules,  provides reports, and controls the automation software. Ingest plays a prominent role in this area as well.  Most program material will be ingested from Avid Unity® and not controlled by the play-out automation system.  These files will require format conversion to the internal format of the transmission servers.  It is important that this process also writes the metadata required by the automation system so that it can recognize the material once it is ingested.  The automation system shall also be able to control a local VTR to ingest material directly into the transmission servers in the event of failure of either Avid or Contractor Provided transcoder.  

b. The middle applications such as  “automation” software which controls the hardware through machine control servers; “playlist” software which receives commands from both the traffic layer and the automation layer; performs monitoring & tracking function, “database and library” software; and other programs designed to mesh the different areas into a unified delivery system. Transcoding also occurs within this area.
 
c. The hardware  which actually performs transcoding, stores material and streams it to air. For the purposes of this document, playout servers may also be called channel servers, cache, edge, transmission or streaming servers. All storage configurations offered must offer seamless delivery of product in the event of a failure in any portion of the configuration.  It is important to note that total redundancy is a critical evaluation item. Downstream keyers and Character Generator are also located in this area.  Character generator will be used for onscreen messaging on a channel-selectable or all-channels basis. DSK will be used for channel branding.  Both shall be controlled either manually or through the playlist as scheduled events.

4.2.	System Reliability

Guaranteed reliability and protection of media and media delivery streams is a fundamental requirement.  All systems evaluated will be assessed against potential single-points of failure.  All systems will be judged as to the level of media protection, server protection, and software failsafes offered in the basic system.   

FOR ENTIRE STATEMENT OF WORK see Announcement #7TF-06-0005SOW.

POINT OF CONTACT AND GSA PROJECT MANAGER FOR THIS REQUIREMENT IS MRS. KAREN BEYER.  ALL inquiries should be addressed to karen.beyer@gsa.gov.
