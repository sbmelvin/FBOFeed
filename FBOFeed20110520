<DESC>The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Region intends to award a sole source contract to Grand Valley Power (GVP) located at 2727 Grand Ave, Grand Junction, CO 84502-0190.
The project consists of extending an existing 3-phase, primary overhead distribution line approximately 9,254 feet to the future site of the Horsthief Canyon Native Fish Facility and to provide a 75 kvs 277/480 volt 3-phase pole mounted transformer bank and associated meter equipment.
A Justification and Approval is being processed for this requirement. The Government anticipates awarding a cost reimbursement contract. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237130 (Power and Communication Line and Related Structures Construction). This requirement is intended as a sole source contract due to the fact that the lines are owned by GVP, and GVP has a longstanding policy prohibiting outside vendors from performing work on their power transmission lines.
All interested parties must respond within 15 days of the appearance of this notice in FedBizOpps. To be considered, interested offerors must submit technical literature describing their capability to effectively satisfy this requirement, as well as terms and conditions and a complete price quote within 15 days of this notice, to the following email address: tworthington@usbr.gov. 
No solicitation exists and requests for a copy of a solicitation will be disregarded unless one is subsequently issued. All responses from responsible sources will be fully considered. As a result of analyzing responses to this synopsis of intent, the Contracting Officer may determine that a solicitation will be issued. If such a solicitation is issued, an additional synopsis may be published. Any such solicitation that will be open to competition will be issued on FedBizOpps in order to permit firms to respond.

<a href="mailto:michael.sheckels@faa.gov">michael.sheckels@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>Posting (brief abstract): The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source, five year contract, including options, to ARINC, 2551 Riva Road, Annapolis, MD 201401.  This contract will replace two existing ARINC contracts that provide support to the FAA's Aviation Weather Research Program.  The estimated value of this contract is $5.5 million.
This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  The FAA is not seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals.In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS), paragraph 3.2.2.4, this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with the selected vendor using single source procedures.In order to realize operational efficiencies, achieve cost savings, and streamline contract administration, the FAA intends to combine the services available through two existing contracts with ARINC (Contracts: DTFAWA-06-P-00001 and DTFAWA-06-C-00028) into a single contract.  The existing contracts currently provide Meteorological Data Collection and Reporting Services (MDCARS), Daily Measurement of Air Traffic Services (DMATS), delivery of aircraft-measured weather data for the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), and NCAR uplink capability for product dissemination to aircraft in flight.  Both contracts expire on September 30, 2011. The FAA has made this single source determination because ARINC is the only respondent to the FAA's October, 15th 2010 market survey, Subject: FAA Aviation Weather Group, Aircraft Weather Observations and Reports Program, that meets the full range and scope of the FAA's requirements.  ARINC has been providing the MDCARS downlink and ground processing services since the program's inception in 1989.  They are the only known vendor that has the ability to acquire airborne meteorological information from all participating airlines by way of High Frequency, Very High Frequency, or Satellite Communication systems.  ARINC is also unique because of its well-established relationships with the airlines participating in the MDCARS program which will help to ensure continuity of services to the FAA without any breaks in operational support.  No other vendor has similar type relationships with all program participants.  Furthermore, ARINC is the only vendor whose system is compatible with the NCAR software the FAA uses to read, parse, and separate down-linked messages.  If another vendor was chosen, NCAR would have to redesign its software to accommodate that vendor.  The FAA would have to fund this redesign which could not take place until after a new vendor was established.  This would cause a break in operational support while the new software was developed and tested.  The FAA would also incur additional costs to modify and/or replace recently installed network hardware that supports the above weather programs.  This hardware would have to be modified or replaced if a vendor other than ARINC was put in place.  There is currently no funding available to accomplish these potential changes.The FAA regards the critical operational nature of these services paramount to public safety.  Procuring them directly through the incumbent service provider is the most effective way to satisfy the FAA's requirements and meet the time constraints inherent in establishing a new contract in place.  Pricing will be consistent with the FAA's two previous contracts for these services.  A continuation of current ARINC services represents the lowest risk, least cost solution to the Government.The FAA will not pay for any information or any costs associated with any response to this announcement.
This announcement is for informational purposes only and is not a Solicitation/Request for Proposal.  A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  Any questions regarding this announcement should be directed to Todd Pennington, Contracting Officer, at 202-493-5960 or by email at todd.pennington@faa.gov by 06/01/2011.Attachments:	none

<p>Background Information<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Gene Therapy (LMVGT), developed processes for producing recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) in suspension cultures. The rAAV prepared in LMVGT is used in preclinical research to assess the potential therapeutic benefits in animal models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The rAAVare produced in stirred-tank bioreactors using cultured cells in a nutrient growth medium. The rAAV remains mostly intracellular and a mechanical homogenizer provides an efficient method for recovering the product. As the cell culture volumes increase, unless the processing equipment is proportionally scaled-up, the processing time becomes a major bottleneck and compromises the quality and quantity of the product. At these relatively large volumes, the efficiency of production becomes a major investment. For example, recovering 50% of rAAV from 200 liters is equivalent to 20% recovery from 500 liters, but the cost of the latter is 2.5x the smaller volume. Currently, the rAAV produced from 200 liters provides sufficient material for testing in 2 to 4 animals. We would prefer to increase manufacturing capacity to 500 liters which would allow us to evaluate the effects in a larger animal group at higher. This is not possible with the current equipment. Therefore, the upgrade to the current equipment is essential for the goals of the laboratory to develop gene therapy applications for DMD.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement<br />The specific objective of this requirement is to upgrade the government owned homogenizer, Model deBEE 1000, manufactured by BEE International in order to increase the cell culture production capacity.</p>
<p>Approximately 4-weeks after receipt of the Homogenizer from the Government, is estimated to complete the upgrade.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements<br />The contractor, BEE International will repair and upgrade the BEE International Homogenizer, Model deBEE 1000, to increase the flow rate from 1 liter per min to 3 liters per minute, to the specifications of the BEE International Homogenizer, Model deBEE 3003.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the repair and upgrade shall include:<br />~ Modification to increase the flow rate capacity from 1 liter to 3-liters per minute.<br />~ Increase the operating pressure from 2,000 to 15,000 PSI (variable).<br />~ Replace the piston and high-pressure cylinders with new components compatible with the reconfigured piston and cylinder assemblies. This include, new check valves, heat exchanger, and outlet valve.<br />~ Design a new reaction chamber that operates at the higher flow rate.<br />~ Install a new process pressure gauge.<br />~ Scale the reaction chamber and the high pressure pistons/cylinders.<br />~ Repair the motor and other parts as needed for any performance problems. <br />~ Perform overall system inspection and maintenance.</p>
<p>Government Responsibilities<br />The NHLBI, LMVGT shall:<br />~ Package and ship the Homogenizer, in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications to BEE International's location for repair and upgrade. <br />~ Communicate with the Contractor during the performance of the repair and upgrade.</p>
<p>Reporting and Deliverable Requirement<br />The Contractor shall deliver one fully functional Homogenizer upgraded from a BEE International Homogenizer, Model deBEE 1000, to a BEE International Homogenizer, Model deBEE 3003, within 4-weeks upon receipt from the Government.</p>
<p>The upgraded Homogenizer shall be delivered to:</p>
<p>Robert M. Kotin, Ph.D.<br />NHLBI, LMVGT<br />10 Center Drive, Room 7D05, MSC 1654<br />Bethesda, Maryland 20892 - 1654<br />Telephone Number: 301- 496-1594<br />Email: kotinr@nhlbi.nih.gov</p>
<p>Program Management and Control<br />None applicable.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance<br />Inspection of the upgraded BEE International Homogenizer, Model deBEE 3003, will be performed at the NHLBI, LMVGT within 24-hours after receipt.</p>
<p>Acceptance by the NHLBI, LMVGT, Project Officer, of the upgraded BEE International Homogenizer, Model deBEE 3003, will occur and conveyed to the contractor within 24-hours after inspection.<br /><br />Attachments<br />None applicable.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that the specific objective of this requirement is to upgrade the government owned homogenizer, Model deBEE 1000, manufactured by BEE International in order to increase the cell culture production capacity. This machine is utilizes as a hydraulic system and two pistons to generate 15,000 PSI with approximately 1 liter per minute flow rate. The BEE International pilot scale homogenizers utilize a proprietary reaction chamber, pistons, and cylinders (covered by US patents 6,746,213; 6,749,329; 6,443,610; and 5,720,551). . .<br />The unit has functioned well for our small-scale and mid-scale processes, but this flow rate is limiting for the larger volumes used for the current production process. With volumes up to 500 liters, the time required for this one step would exceed 8 hrs and realistically require at least 10 hr. BEE International has the capabilities to re-configure the current instrument to the larger capacity system. The deBEE 1000 uses the same platform and architecture as the larger capacity deBEE 3003 homogenizer, which processes 3 liters per minute. The equipment modification involves scaling the proprietary reaction chamber and the high-pressure pistons/cylinders to achieve the increased flow rates. Therefore, it is in the Government's best interest to return the unit to the manufacture for the upgrade.</p>
<p><br />The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 811219, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance with size standard of $19.0M; the small business set-aside does apply for this requirement.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition <br />procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-50 (April 15, 2011).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by May 27, 2011, 7:30 am Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast (NAVFAC SE) has been tasked to develop, solicit, and award an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) multiple award construction contract (MACC) for general construction type work to be performed at Marine Corps Logistics Base (MCLB) Albany, GA.  This acquisition will result in a competitively negotiated Firm Fixed Price (FFP) design-bid-build IDIQ MACC.  Up to five (5) MACCs will be awarded, unless the source selection authority determines that a number more than five (5) is in the best interest of the Government.  Construction projects to be performed will primarily consist of general building type projects (new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work) including industrial, airfield, aircraft hangar, aircraft traffic control, infrastructure, administrative, training, dormitory, and community support facilities for Department of Defense activities in the Albany, GA area managed by NAVFAC SE.
  Work may be required in other areas in the area of responsibility of NAVFAC Southeast if deemed necessary.  The aggregate value of all contracts awarded from any resultant solicitation is anticipated to be $60,000,000 over the base year and two option periods combined.  Task orders will be firm fixed-priced, normally in the range of $150,000 to $5,000,000 per order.  However, task orders under or over these amounts may be considered if deemed to be in the Governments best interest and approved by the appropriate NAVFAC authority.      

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued as a competitive requirement open to small business firms in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.2, Full and Open Competition After Exclusion of Sources.
  The RFP will be open to participation by interested small business firms with specialized experience and qualifications required by this contract.  The NAICS code for this IDIQ MACC solicitation is 236220 with a size standard of $33,500,000.  

The source selection method being used is a best value continuum process in a negotiated acquisition utilizing the trade-off approach.  Formal source selection will be used to select the proposals that provide the best value to the Government from a technical and price standpoint.  In accordance with FAR Subparts 15.1 and 15.3, a trade-off approach to source selection will be used for this solicitation with respect to the initial award.  The solicitation evaluation factors for the MACC award will state that technical factors are equal in importance to each other and, when combined, are approximately equal to price.
    Future task orders will also be competed using trade-off procedures.  

Interested small business firms will be required to submit technical and price proposals for a seed project.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The offeror with the best value proposal for the seed project will be awarded the seed project and an IDIQ Construction Contract for a base year with two (2) option years.  The remaining four (4) selected offerors, also offering the best value proposals, considering technical and price proposals, will be awarded an IDIQ Construction Contract for a base year and two (2) option years with a minimum guarantee of $25,000.00 over the thirty six (36) month period.
    
The proposed seed project for this solicitation consists of two (2) items:
0001 - Interior renovation of the main lobby at building 2200, Maintenance Center, MCLB Albany per plans and specs provided by NAVFAC SE.  
0002 - Renovation of the Snack Bar at building 2200, Maintenance Center, MCLB Albany per plans and specs provided by NAVFAC SE. 
The estimated construction cost for item 0001 is between $200,000 and $300,000.  The estimated construction cost for item 0002 is between $200,000 and $300,000.  Both items have a completion schedule of 180 days from task order award.  The liquidated damages for this project will be calculated separately at time of award based on the actual award amount for item 0001 and item 0002.

Contract award is anticipated on or around 30 Sep 2011.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>I. DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) announces a Request for Professional Qualifications for Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms interested in contracting with the Volpe Center to provide A-E services for projects in transportation modernization support services.</p>
<p>The objective of this procurement is to acquire A-E services to support areas of repair, design, and maintenance of transportation-related facilities and infrastructure with an emphasis on High Speed Rail (HSR) infrastructure. This work entails engineering support for buildings, facilities interiors, underground and elevated structures, towers, bridges, pavements, offshore structures, port facilities, hazardous material remediation, pipelines, and infrastructure security for the DOT, the Department of Defense (DOD), and other Government agencies. Although the emphasis is in civil engineering, other supporting disciplines such as mechanical, electrical, environmental, industrial, and marine engineering, as well as computer and systems technologies will be required.</p>
<p>Primary concentration is expected to be in the civil engineering areas of high speed railroad infrastructure. Support will also be required in the design and testing of railroad vehicles and components, propulsion evaluations, transportation operational analysis, and advanced intelligent rail systems technology development. The majority of the work will be performed throughout the contiguous United States; however, there may be projects requiring travel to Hawaii, Alaska, and foreign countries.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition will support the design, repair and maintenance of transportation systems and subsystems, including infrastructure and facilities. This includes multi-levels of engineering management processes for planning, developing, and coordinating systems engineering and technical management to produce a sound systems engineering strategy to optimize performance.</p>
<p>The contractors shall be firms of established reputation in A-E services related to infrastructure planning and design, construction, repairs, maintenance, remediation, operations and development, and upgrading of transportation facilities within a certain timeframe. Primary concentration is expected to be in HSR technologies and rail structures, aviation and marine facilities, and vehicles and vessels. Support will also be required in design and testing, technology assessments and evaluation, system designs, propulsion evaluations, transportation operational analysis, and advanced intelligent rail systems technology development. Engineering disciplines will also be required in the mechanical, electrical, electronic, environmental, security and systems fields. In addition, the Volpe Center requires skills in a wide spectrum of other disciplines, including economics, program management, earned value management, financial management, emergency response as related to transportation, man-machine interface analysis and development, risk management, and information systems.</p>
<p>The seven (7) functional areas include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>1. Infrastructure/Facilities Planning; <br />2. Infrastructure/Facilities Inspection and Assessment; <br />3. Testing Studies, Analysis, and Operational Assessments; <br />4.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract. This notice is to announce the revision of the contract maximum amount on the Mid-Endurance Unmanned Aircraft System (MEUAS). This Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract was competed and awarded to The Boeing Company on 28 April 2009.
<p>At the time of award, the contract maximum for the five year period was $250,000,000 with anticipated performance through 27 April 2014. During contract operations, new requirements were validated for additional unmanned aircraft system (UAS) intelligence gathering, target surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) services using the MEUAS contract. With these additional requirements it became apparent the existing ceiling would be reached prior to the end of the five year contract ordering period. Program efforts were initiated to establish the competitive follow-on MEUAS II contract. This proposed contract action is to assure continuous operational capability while the competitive acquisition is completed.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.1, Only One Responsible Source. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. Instead, the policies contained in Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, will be used.</p>

<a href="mailto:joshua.cohen2@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Technology Center (TAC) intends to award a seventeen-month Firm-Fixed-Price contract to John Hopkins University (JHU), 733 N. Broadway, Suite 117, Baltimore, Maryland 22105-1832 for pilot testing, installation and maintenance services, and modifications to the VA's Multiple Sclerosis Home Automated Telemanagement (MS-HAT) application.  MS-HAT is a home automated telemanagement system which allows remote management of chronic Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patient care between local VA Medical Centers and patients' homes.  MS is a common neurological condition in the VA with over 25,000 veterans affected with the disease.  Many are limited in their ability to come to MS clinical referral centers due to distance and their disability.  MS-HAT's unique approach, developed by JHU, includes veteran-tailored computer interfaces specifically designed for individuals with cognitive, vision, and locomotion impairments which can be delivered via the internet and a variety of other telemanagement systems uniquely suited to internet based care of chronically affected patients.  Specifically, this MS-HAT pilot program will test the feasibility of MS-HAT for a robust MS population and the Home Automated Telemanagement System as a practical telemanagement platform for the VA.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  Only JHU can provide the aforementioned pilot testing, installation and maintenance services as JHU developed the initial MS-HAT system which was based on software proprietary to JHU.  The VA does not currently have the software specifications to MS-HAT necessary for anyone other than JHU to perform the required modification and upgrade services.  Based on their unique qualifications, prior development of the MS-HAT system which is based on a platform proprietary to JHU, and their successful record in telemonitoring program development, no other contractor is capable of providing the aforementioned services to MS-HAT.   Further, it would be cost prohibitive to reproduce the unique telecare components and disease management approaches developed by the JHU team on the MS-HAT development program which this effort proposes to pilot test.  

Deliverables are to be FOB Destination with Inspection/Acceptance at Destination.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541511 with the corresponding small business size standard of $25,000,000.  The solicitation number assigned to this effort is VA118-11-RP-0380 and will be issued on or about May 27, 2011.  Performance will be at the Contractor's facility.  An award date no later than June 30, 2011 is desired.  P.O.C. for this acquisition will be Joshua Cohen, 732-440-9696, Joshua.cohen2@va.gov.

Installation of the kits is not part of this RFI. The contractor will procure, assemble, test, and deliver approximately 40ea V5 SLEP kits to be installed in the AN/TYQ-23 (V)5. The major items of the kits are identified in section 4 (parts internal to the OM) and section 5 (parts external to the OM). Additional requirements are included in section 6.

<DESC>Introduction

This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified sources able to meet VA requirements, to assist in planning possible future technical requirements, determine the appropriate acquisition strategy, and understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this RFI will be the outcome of the competitive process.  Telephone inquiries and responses will not be accepted at this time since there is no further information available.  This announcement is based upon the best information available and is subject to future modification.  VA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this RFI.  VA is not seeking elaborate oral presentations in response to this RFI, nor should the written response be any more than informational.  

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the VA is looking for sources able to provide a solution for a Real Time Location System (RTLS) at our Charleston, SC Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) location. The VA understands the breadth and depth of the desired RTLS solution and is looking to determine the ability of industry to provide a solution.  

Overview

In 1946, the VA became the first organization in the United States to provide medications for its patients using a mail delivery service through individual VA medical centers. During the 1970s and 1980s, consolidation of mail prescription workloads from multiple VA medical centers into central operations was initiated on a limited basis. In 1994, the Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) at Leavenworth, Kansas began the processing of high volume mail prescription workloads using an integrated, automated dispensing system. Since that time the VA has expanded the program to include a total of seven (7) CMOP facilities located at Leavenworth, KS; Tucson, AZ ; Chelmsford (Boston), MA; Dallas, TX; Murfreesboro (Nashville), TN; Hines (Chicago), IL; and Charleston, SC which process total nationwide workloads exceeding one hundred (100) million prescriptions annually. The Charleston CMOP has contracted and VA staff of approximately 300.  It completes roughly 110,000 prescriptions per day, five days a week, and totaling 25 million per year.  
Patients are provided care by the VA medical centers or clinics with new or emergent prescriptions being dispensed directly from that medical center or clinic. Refill prescription requests or continuation of therapy prescription requests are received and processed at the individual VA sites on a daily basis. The CMOP processes prescriptions based upon the electronic dispensing data downloaded from VA medical centers and outpatient clinics nationwide, dispenses the pharmaceuticals or products as determined by the participating site, delivers the completed prescriptions directly to the patient by mail or other carrier and returns the electronic dispensing data to the participating medical center or clinic.  The CMOP function is transparent to the patient. Patients contact the medical center or clinic directly if there are any questions or problems, and resolution is accomplished by the participating site in coordination with the CMOP. 
The CMOP serves each participating VA medical center or outpatient clinic as an integrated extension of each of those sites and has been a vehicle of change in the standardization of drug nomenclature, the standardization of dispensing units, and the standardization of pharmaceutical product and medical supply selection. The normal processing time for an order at the CMOP is less than two (2) days with mail delivery typically requiring less than three days. 
The Charleston CMOP seeks a turnkey, integrated RTLS to be deployed in its facility.  The purpose is to improve the efficiency of certain business processes in this location. The CMOP has identified the following needs for the RTLS solution:
"	Provide the facility with the real-time capability to actively track critical assets and staff
"	Monitor temperature
The Charleston CMOP goals for the RTLS solution are to:
o	Improve Operational efficiency
o	Decrease operational costs 
o	Maximize equipment utilization
o	Increase staff productivity
o	Reduce delays in processing
o	Minimize lost and misplaced items
o	Increase staff safety 


Requirements

The Charleston CMOP needs to identify, as part of our market research, sources capable and interested in providing a RTLS for the purpose of tracking assets and staff, among other possible uses to be determined in the future.  In addition, environmental monitoring such as temperature will be required.  The CMOP is also interested in the ability of a single source to support multiple technologies for deployment (using existing wireless infrastructure) and the ability to use other tags (such as passive RFID) and technologies to meet specifications and specialized needs.  The RTLS system must also be capable of exchanging data with VA information systems.

For the purposes of this RFI, the CMOP has defined the following space areas.  Please consider all of these areas when responding to relevant questions. 

Building	A free-standing structure

Floor	An entire level in a building

Zone	A defined area on a floor:  multiple spaces

Room	Smaller unit on a floor / zone.  Has a defined entrance / exit point.

Individual Work Vicinity	A designated area within a room or Zone.  
 
The Charleston CMOP currently utilizes an 802.11.g Air Fortress Infrastructure.  It is not currently designed for an RTLS solution and may need to upgraded or enhanced if the RTLS solution utilizes 802.11 technologies.  The Facility is a single building with 78,000 sq ft, of which 60,000 is open space in a warehouse type fashion.  There is a large conveyor assembly line than runs through the building.  It is expected that Zones will be able to be configured within this open space for narrowing down location of tagged items to within ten (10) feet.  In addition, many assets are located in the ceiling of this building which is approximately thirteen (13) ft from ground level.

The range of RTLS capabilities with which the CMOP wishes to begin deployment, shall include but are not limited to the following:

A.	Asset Tracking Capability - Provide CMOP staff with the capability to locate portable assets used throughout the facility to support the delivery of services. Varying levels of location resolution should be offered to meet site specific requirements from building level of discrimination to more discrete individual work vicinity discrimination in real time.  Approximately, 2000 assets have been identified that will require tracking.

B.	Automated Temperature Capability - Provide real time temperature monitoring for refrigerated areas that store pharmaceuticals, food, and other items at specified temperatures.  The system can monitor and record temperatures at predetermined time intervals and immediately report any temperature anomalies based on configured thresholds.  Approximately, thirty (30) assets will require tagging with a NIST Temperature Probe.

C.	Business Process Workflow - Track facility staff and mobile carts with the objective of monitoring business activities with the goal is to improve workflow through analysis of the monitoring data provided by the RTLS.  Approximately three hundred (300) staff and fifty (50) carts will be tagged.

D.	Technical Engineering Services - Required services may include Radio Frequency Site Survey, WiFi network re-engineering or enhancements, Software Configuration; Upgrades and Updates to all delivered software; Technical Engineering Services (Installation, De-installation, Relocation of RTLS components), System Integration; RTLS Implementation Support; Software Development Services; Maintenance, Warranty and Training.  Solutions shall integrate all technology to provide a transparent solution to the user.  

Attachment A to this document provides descriptions of example Use Cases for RTLS deployment to assist with detailing how the CMOP will utilize the technology.

ATTACHMENT A:

1.1	ASSET MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW USE CASE

Use case goal is to track all equipment / assets for purposes of conducting inventory, preventing theft, and finding the assets when needed.  
Computer laptops, stationary administrative and IT equipment, and stationary equipment shall be tracked through the use of active technology that will prevent theft and allow users to locate equipment for purposes of inventory on an annual basis.    

System shall have the ability to trigger an external audible, silent alarm and/or security cameras, or other warning alert when an asset is leaving the building or unauthorized location, based on assigned rules.

The system will need to log all events and issue an email, pager, telephone call or inter-system message. Location will be updated when it re-enters a new zone or area in the facility.  System should have the ability track movement of staff throughout the facility into defined work areas to assist with operational and production flow.  

System shall have the ability to alert when the tag battery reaches a critical level to ensure continuous monitoring of assets.

Tags must be made available that have the ability to send an alert when a tag is tampered with.

An alert shall be triggered when a tagged asset enters a non authorized area, based on assigned rules. Reader infrastructure at chokepoints shall not resemble department store or high security chokepoints.  They shall be aesthetically appealing and blend in with the general dcor of the facility if utilized.  System should have the ability to run reports verifying asset locations at any time necessary and support a query method to find a specific asset.

1.2	TEMPERATURE MONITORING USE CASE

Use case goal is to automate the daily process of validating temperature on refrigerators and freezers that store pharmaceuticals and food.  Daily checks need to occur and be documented for temperature and time of day.
Alerts / Alarms need to be sent via pager, email and with RTLS System when a temperature goes out of range for a specified amount of time.

Reports shall be developed that will detail daily reading, errors, corrective actions, and parties completing corrections.

Reports shall be able to be run over a one (1) year period.  

1.3	STAFF MONITORING USE CASE
Beyond monitoring the assets within the CMOP, we wish to monitor staff activities in the following ways:
Time accounting for contract staff - the system shall assist in validation of contract staffing invoices by tracking when staff enter and exit facilities.  

The movement of staff through the facility (i.e. entering and leaving facility, passing through chokepoints) shall be monitored and information shall be stored for a period of three (3) months.

1.4	HAND-WASHING VERIFICATION
Use case goal is to validate staff hand washing rates.  The CMOP facility deploys hand washing stations at all sinks and also at stationary locations throughout the facility via a dispensing station.  It is expected that hand washing rates can be monitored as a staff member approaches a hand washing station and deploys a dispensing container. The system would have the capability to monitor the hand washing compliance, i.e., hand hygiene sensing device detects the dispensing of the hand washing product and would communicate via employee badge to record the event. System would monitor the hand sanitizing after rest room use and after scheduled breaks. 
"	The system should detect if the employee washed their hands and for how long did the washing take place.

"	The system should detect and report if the employee had not washed their hands sufficiently. 

1.5	EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
Use case goal is to track movement of staff throughout the facility to locate staff in emergency situations or when needed to perform certain functions (service assistance, etc).  
"	During a declared emergency, the system should rapidly detect staff locations and monitor their movement to a safe location.

"	System shall monitor progress of staff movement and provide an alert if specific staff location criteria are not met within a defined time period.

The Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis' (DPA) work on library-based methods has shown that spectral libraries are an excellent way to perform rapid, non-destructive identification and verification analysis on excipients (raw materials) and active pharmaceutical ingredients. In the next phase, the FDA plans on developing rapid Raman Library-Based Methods to study the drug quality of medical countermeasure (MCM) drugs. These drugs play an important role in protecting public health during a national crisis. In addition to ensuring that quality drugs are available during a national crisis, the studies will also provide a more efficient avenue for detecting and preventing adulterated or counterfeit medicines from being stockpiled.

<DESC>1.0   DescriptionNASA investment of resources to communicate with the private sector may aid in thedevelopment and demonstration of safe, reliable, and cost-effective space transportationcapabilities. In a multiphase strategy, the program would help to spur the innovation anddevelopment of new spacecraft and launch vehicles from the commercial industry, creatinga new way of delivering cargo  and eventually crew  to low-Earth orbit (LEO) and theInternational Space Station (ISS). As NASA retires the Space Shuttle, the ability ofprivate industry to take on the task of providing routine access to space is of vitalimportance. NASA is currently developing requirements for a Commercial Crew Transportation (CCT)capability that would be able to transport NASA astronauts and other spaceflightparticipants safely to and from LEO and the ISS. This RFI will be implemented through direct collaborations with U.S. space industryparticipants who are actively developing a viable Crew Transportation System (CTS) or anelement of a system (i.e., launch vehicle or spacecraft) with significant and recentflight history for the purpose of conducting market research under Federal AcquisitionRegulation (FAR) Part 10.  The purpose of these collaborations is to permit NASA tocollect technical information from industry on specific CTSs and elements to help NASAidentify whether its needs can be met by commercial CTS capabilities anticipated tobecome available to support the ISS.   NASA is also seeking feedback from industry on its1100 Series and may provide an opportunity for industry participants to obtain apreliminary evaluation of their CTS or element against NASAs draft requirements andfeedback on whether their CTS or element would meet NASAs draft requirements.	NASAcommunication to participants will not involve proposed solutions, recommendations, oradvice on the participants design. The process also permits industry participants toprovide feedback on the technical feasibility and cost effectiveness of NASAs proposedcertification approach.  Review of lower level components or subsystems, such as lifesupport systems, launch abort systems, or rendezvous sensors, would not materiallyadvance the development of NASAs 1100 Series, information on components or subsystems donot meet the purpose of this RFI and will not be considered.NASA anticipates entering into appropriate arrangements to support these collaborations;including providing necessary access to NASA facilities, personnel and technicalinformation, however, there will be no provision of funds in connection with thisopportunity.  Respondents will be responsible for financing their own activities. Participation in significant or structured analysis and feedback activities will becontingent upon negotiation of an appropriate arrangement between NASA and each industryparticipant.  This opportunity for collaboration is not exclusive; NASA, at itsdiscretion, may enter into arrangements to collect information with one or more industryparticipants. NASA will not issue paper copies of this RFI. NASA reserves the right to select forinitial communication all, some, or none of the requests submitted in response to thisRFI. NASA provides no funding for reimbursement of the costs of requesting to participatein this RFI.  Material submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned. It is not NASAs intent to publicly disclose proprietary information obtained during thisRFI. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Actand other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as Proprietary orConfidential will be kept confidential.  NASA reserves the right to share allinformation received in response to this RFI throughout NASA to determine eligibility asset forth in Section 4 below.NASA will require the ability to use data received during the collaboration process todetermine  whether its needs can be met, and evaluate the participants CTS or elementsagainst NASAs draft requirements in order to identify possible improvements orrefinements to its 1100 Series.  NASA may use contractor support personnel to assist in providing expertise regardingduring the collaboration period.  Any support contractor involved in the collaborationprocess shall be free of conflicts of interest, will be bound by appropriatenon-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and competition sensitive information.  2.0 GENERAL INFORMATION Agency Name: NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Opportunity Title: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Response Date: Electronic requests for participation in this RFI should be received nolater than June 3, 2011 at 4:00P.M.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought/Market Research announcement. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) NOAA Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) is seeking a contractor to (1) Provide three fishing vessels (including crew) for up to 45 days per quarter to conduct a pilot fishery independent survey for bottomfish in waters around Oahu and Maui using local fishing vessels, (2) expand the State of Hawaii's bottomfish tagging program to include other areas and species, (3) network with local fisherman and industry to expand fishery dependent sampling of bottomfish at major landing ports and/or auctions throughout the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI), and (4) assist with logistics to discuss progress of the projects with local constituents, including the fishing and scientific communities.
<p>The fishery independent pilot survey constitutes a feasibility study, and data from the survey will be used to determine optimal gear(s), sample sizes, and number of vessels needed to implement fishery independent surveys in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Guam, CNMI and American Samoa. The contracted vessels shall have, in proper working order, all required USCG approved safety, navigation and communication devices. Captains of contracted vessels must have sufficient experience with bottomfish fishing in the Hawaiian Archipelago.<br />Data from the tagging study will provide growth and movement data to advance the development of species specific models, as well as our understanding of connectivity. Current length and weight sampling of bottomfish catch in the MHI occurs only at the United Fish Auction (UFA) in Honolulu. A significant amount of catch is also landed and sold at landing ports and/or auctions on islands other than Oahu. Because the growth of individual bottomfish species differs between islands in the MHI, the length structure of the catch from the UFA is not representative of other areas. Data from this study will allow for the development of spatially explicit models and biological reference points. The meetings are an effective way of communicating progress, while at the same time promoting open communication and trust with local fisherman and scientists.<br />REQUIREMENT<br />The Contractor shall furnish the necessary vessels, personnel, equipment, and services (including all bottomfish fishing gear, bait and insurance for the vessel and the ship's personnel) to perform the statement of work/specifications shown below. <br />- Provide three (3) fishing vessels (including crew) to conduct fishing operations for 45 days each quarter year at selected sites in waters around Oahu and Maui. In addition, contract at-sea technicians (scientific personnel) to collect scientific data while at sea. The Captains of contracted vessels must have sufficient experience with bottomfish fishing in the Hawaiian Archipelago. Vessels must be capable of housing 1-2 scientific personnel and crew for the duration of the fishing trip.</p>
<p>- Provide additional fisherman to tag and release bottomfish during regular fishing operations following standardized protocols. A key-species list will be provided to each contracted vessel along with tags. While conducting fishing operations throughout the contract period, fish will be tagged and released by the crew and requisite information recorded (e.g., tag number).</p>
<p>- Identify a network of bottomfish landing ports in the MHI to conduct length and weight sampling. Assist with the development and implementation of sampling protocols to collect length and weight data and contract technicians or fishermen to collect these data.</p>
<p>- Periodically conduct constituent meetings to discuss progress of the projects.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government.<br />No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor's information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Please submit your firm's statement of capabilities, not to exceed 10 pages, including:</p>
<p>1) Your firm's DUNS number &amp; CAGE code;<br />2) Your firm's SBA certified small business concern status (if any). Specifically identify if your firm is HUBZone-certified, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, or SBA 8(a) program certified;<br />3) A brief description of your firm's recent past experience (within past 3 years) performing services of a similar nature and magnitude; and<br />4) Identification of portions of the requirement that your firm would likely subcontract out. <br />Information must be received by the Contract Specialist, Levis Knox, at levis.d.knox@noaa.gov by 2:00 pm PDT on 10 June 2011. Any questions or responses regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via e-mail to the above e-mail address. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>

<DESC><p>This Request For Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified small business (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) capable of performing the services described herein. The Government will not pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government's use of that information. No contract or other instrument will be issued as a result of this RFI.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Single Family Claims Branch (SFCB), and Single Family Post Insurance Division (SFPID) is responsible for the payment of insurance benefits based on claims filed by Lending Institutions. This includes several types of claims, including conveyance claims, loss mitigation claims, Hawaiian Homeland claims and 3 types of Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) claims. Changing policy and regulation, in addition to the economic problems faced by the United States has led to a dramatic increase in the number of home loans going into default and the number of claims being filed with HUD. To ensure that claims submitted by mortgagees for insurance benefits are reviewed and processed in an accurate and timely manner, the SFCB requires support in its control and processing of HECM claims. <br />Currently, there are approximately 30,000 insured HECM mortgages that are in technical default. These technical defaults will either be cured by the homeowners bringing the taxes and insurance payments current or be cured via foreclosure and sale of the properties. Since cured HECM mortgages become eligible for assignment. HUD could receive thousands of additional HECM assignment claims in the near future. Those that do not cure voluntarily will enter foreclosure. At the conclusion of the foreclosure, and after property sale, these mortgages will result in Type 21 HECM claims being submitted to the Department. The foreclosure process can take months to complete. However, it is reasonable to assume that almost all 30,000 mortgages currently in technical default may come into the department as HECM claims over the next 2 years.</p>
<p>HUD is seeking a contractor to process Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) claims in a timely and efficient manner. The Contractor shall provide the following: collection of claim packages from HUD Headquarters, receipt of the claim recordings, analysis of claim packages for completeness and correctness, preparation of letters of denial, data entry of claim elements, preparation of claim payment documents, return of claim packages to HUD for payment and payment notification to mortgagees. The Contractor shall have the qualifications, commitment, and experience to perform the services. The contractor must handle the claims from receipt to payment authorization. The Contractor must satisfy all requirements specified in this RFI.</p>
<p>HUD anticipates making (1) award. The Period of Performance is for a 12 month base period plus (2) one year option periods.</p>
<p>Interested vendors shall provide a detailed capability statement that would allow the government to determine that they have the expertise, experience, and knowledge to perform the requirement.</p>
<p>Within the capability statement, describe your understanding of the requirement by defining the specific labor categories necessary to meet the desired requirement. Capability statements must address at least two prior contracts that reflect similar type, scope of services and the number of concurrent staff resources available. Contract's place of performance may be performed at the contractor facility.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 541211 "Offices of Certified Public Accountants" The small business size standard is $8.5M. Interested small business offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice. However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required. Responses must directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform each of the processes described above in sufficient level of detail to allow definitive numerical evaluation; and evidence that the contractor can satisfy the minimum requirements listed above in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 ("Limitations of Subcontracting").</p>
<p>Submissions shall address the following:</p>
<p>1) Business name, address, telephone number <br />2) Name, title, telephone number, and e-mail address, etc.<br />3) Socio-economic classification (i.e., HUB Zone and/or 8 (a) status)) and point of contact.<br />4) Business size for NAICS<br />5) DUNS number<br />6) Identification of the firm's GSA Schedule, if applicable<br />7) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102, apply to this procurement. Prospective contractors must be registered under the appropriate NAICS code prior to award. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Information on CCR registration can be obtained at http://www.ccr.gov. Information on annual Representations and Certifications can be obtained at http://orca.bpn.gov.<br />8) Provide evidence of knowledge, experience and expertise in processing claims for same or similar item.<br />9) Approved Accounting system info, if applicable<br />10) Please submit copies of any documentation such as letters or certificates to indicate the firm's status<br />11) 10 page limitation.</p>
<p>PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT CCR'S AND ORCA REPORT.</p>
<p>Teaming arrangements are acceptable, and the information required above on the company responding to this announcement, should also be provided for each entity expected to be teammates of the respondent for performance of this work.To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure.</p>
<p>Other Information<br /><br />It is important to note that vendor responses are solely for the purpose of requesting industry feedback. This RFI/survey does not constitute any type of competition or prequalification. Responses are solely for the government's use in developing its strategy for the Government, therefore responses will not be evaluated, and the government is under no obligation to post the responses received from industry. The potential strategy alternative should not be construed in any way as the official Government strategy, nor do they commit HUD to a particular course of action or a particular timeline. Again, this is a market research effort to determine the capability of qualified small business to process claims as stated herein. The Government will not be responsible for the cost of creating response submissions. Vendors must appropriately mark each page of their submission that contains proprietary information. HUD will adhere to FAR policy on handling proprietary information. This is not a solicitation and no contract will be awarded as a result of this <br />RFI notice. The Government reserves the right to post additional notices relative to this RFI and request other capability statements and/or similar documentation.</p>
<p>Responses to this announcement will not be returned, nor will there be any ensuing discussions or debriefings of any responses. However, information obtained as a result of this announcement may be reflected in the subsequent solicitation, and HUD may contact one or more respondents for clarifications to enhance the Government's understanding. The responses to this RFI may result in revisions in both its requirements and its acquisition strategy based on industry responses. RESPONDENTS MUST SUBMIT ALL CAPABILITY STATEMENTS VIA E-MAIL to Brenda K. Lee at Brenda.K.Lee@hud.gov no later than June 2, 2011 2:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time for consideration.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  This is not a request for proposal.  There will not be a solicitation issued at this time.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 18 - Phoenix Consolidated Contracting Activity, has a requirement for labor, materials, equipment and supervision to perform project 649-11-106, Modernize/Replace Communications Infrastructure Phase 1,2,3 at the Northern Arizona VA Healthcare System (NAVAHCS), Prescott Arizona.  The Northern Arizona VA Health Center fiber optic communications system has developed over time on an "as-needed" basis, connecting computer servers to terminal locations, fire alarms, security monitors and building digital control systems to monitoring stations at the Boiler Plant and the VA Police Department.  Most of the connections between the buildings are routed through the steam tunnels, and where no steam tunnels existed, underground conduit has been installed to connect the steam tunnels to the terminal locations to complete the fiber communication runs.  Some sections of the existing fiber optic network have been in service for over 25 years, well beyond its expected service life.  By current standards, the existing fiber system is extremely slow, and for the most part, incapable of carrying any additional data.  The system is also based on the assumption that optical fiber is inherently secure and that data couldn't be "siphoned" off the system.  The NAVAHCS fiber optic infrastructure does not meet current industry, VA or NIST 800-53 standards.  Our current fiber optic distribution system is working at capacity and more capacity is needed.  The system also needs to be secured against data theft, and a substantial portion of the system has degraded to an unacceptable level of reliability.  The problems with the system are system-wide and cannot be reasonably addressed on a case-by-case basis. 
The applicable NAICS code is 238210 Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors.  Electrical contractors have a size standard of $14 million in average annual receipts.   It is anticipated that a Request for Proposals will be issued in May, 2011. Award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract is contemplated by September, 2011. This notice is published to conduct market research to determine if there is a sufficient number of certified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) capable of performing the requirements to warrant a solicitation set-aside.  It is strongly recommended that interested parties register in the US Department of Veterans Affairs Vet Biz database.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/.  Interested parties responding to this sources sought request shall submit the following information at a minimum: (1) company name and address, point of contact with phone number, and DUNS number; (2) documentation relating to capability of performance of fire alarm system construction project (including references); (3) intentions of subcontracting program to include set-asides; (4) proof of registration in the VA Vet Biz website or intention of registration prior to submission of offers to a solicitation; (5) documentation on company's bonding capacity and limitations; and (6) any other pertinent company documentation.   The response date to this Sources Sought notice is May 27th, 2011 at 5:00 pm.  This market research is for informational and planning purposes only to determine if a SDVOSB or VOSB set-aside is appropriate.  The Government will not pay any costs for responses submitted.  Electronic submissions are acceptable via Justin.Hicks@va.gov. Hard copy submissions are acceptable to VISN 18 Consolidated Contracting Office (Building 28), 650 E Indian School Rd, Phoenix, AZ  85012.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS and is not a solicitation announcement.   The purpose of this Market Research and Sources Sought Notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified Small Business firms.  Responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis will be used by the government in making appropriate acquisition decisions.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, anticipates a future procurement to construct an aquatic ecosystem restoration project at Columbus, GA and Phenix City, AL.  Because of local site conditions, the proposed work will require close attention to ensure safety of contractor employees, equipment, and constructed work.  The project will be constructed in the Chattahoochee River at Columbus, Georgia and Phenix City, Alabama.  The stream flow of the river at this location varies daily between 800 cfs and 13,000 cfs based on the operation of an upstream hydroelectric plant.  This project consists of the removal of two low-head dams, two predecessor dams, the construction of an aquatic habitat pool, and the construction of fish stranding reduction channels.  450 feet of the Eagle-Phenix dam and 350 feet of the City Mills dams will be removed.  50 feet of each end of each dam will be left intact.  Both dams are constructed of masonry and stone.  The predecessor dams will be removed in their entirety and were timber-crib construction.  The aquatic habitat pool will be formed by the construction of a series of grouted rock weirs that will include provisions for planting vegetation.  The stranding reduction channels will be constructed by rock removal at about four locations in the City Mills pool.  The project will be constructed in two phases.  Phase I will include the Eagle-Phenix work along with the aquatic habitat pool.  Phase II will include the City Mills work along with the stranding reduction channels.<br><br>The cost of construction will not exceed $10 million.  Proposed construction duration of 540 calendar days.  Sources are being sought for firms with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code of 237990 with a Small Business Size Standard of $33.5M.  Responses are requested with the following information, which shall not exceed a total of eight pages.  1. Offerors' name, address, points of contact with telephone numbers and e-mail addresses.  2.  Business size/classification to include any designations as Small Business, HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, or 8(a) shall be indicated on first page of submission.  3.  Bonding capability (construction bonding level per single contract and aggregate construction bonding level, both expressed in dollars; along with current available bonding capacity.  4. Description of capability to perform the proposed construction, manage subcontractors, prepare and comply with various environmental and construction permits, and capacity to execute this project with other ongoing construction contracts.  5. Past performance/experience on projects of similar scope and magnitude, describing no more than five (5) projects that are at least 50 percent construction complete within the past five years.  The past performance information should include project title, location, general description of the construction to demonstrate relevance to the proposed project, the Offerors' role, dollar value of contract, and name of the company, agency or government entity for which the work was performed with contact information (reference name, phone number and e-mail address).  <br><br>Responses should be submitted via e-mail to Ms. Melinda Bramlett, Contracting Officer at  Melinda.H. Bramlett@usace.army.mil.  You may also mail submittals or send overnight courier to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, 109 St. Joseph Street, Mobile, AL 36602-3620.  Attn: M.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Acquisitions Operations Group, supporting the Technical Service Center, Denver, CO intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with MGS Engineering Consultants, 7326 Boston Harbor Road NE, Olympia, WA  98506-9766.  The Bureau of Reclamation is currently seeking support for hydrologic work in preparation for modification to Friant Dam in Fresno County, California.  The acquisition requires the contractor to modify the Stochastic Event Flood Model (SEFM) to add the capability of simulating upstream dam operations, modify SEFM to support Excel 2007, provide technical support to Reclamation personnel in the application of SEFM to the San Joaquin River, extend and update precipitation studies developed for the American River watershed to include the San Joaquin River watershed, provide technical support to Reclamation personnel in developing spatial and temporal precipitation templates for use in SEFM and revise the SEFM Users manual.Notice of Intent to Issue Sole Source Award
MGS Engineering Consultants (MGS) possesses the unique capabilities and experience to provide the requirements for this acquisition.  Over the past 10 years MGS has developed a Stochastic Event Flood Model (SEFM) capable of producing probabilistic flood hydrographs.  Reclamation technical staff network with a large group of researchers in the field of Flood Hydrology and this is the only model of its kind known to exist.  Dr. Melvin Schaefer, President of MGS, initially began development of SEFM when he was employed by the Washington Department of Ecology with assistance from Reclamation.  Work has continued on the model with funding from Reclamation and the Corps of Engineers.  The current project builds on work already completed by Dr. Schaefer.  He is the only one with rights to all of the computer code for SEFM and he conducted the American River precipitation study that will be expanded for use on the San Joaquin River watershed where Friant Dam is located.  In addition, he is currently applying SEFM to the watershed upstream from Friant Dam.  Without SEFM and Dr. Schaefer's experience, the additional cost to the project would be prohibitive and would take an estimated four years to complete by other companies not familiar with the historical work.  There would be significant duplication of costs and the required delivery date would not be meet. 
Competition is restricted to only one source per FAR 6.302-1.  The period of performance is expected to begin June 6, 2011 and continue through December 31, 2011.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   However, capability statements received by 2:00 pm MDT June 3, 2011 will be considered by the Government.   A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses to this notice shall be submitted to Melanie Russell, Contract Specialist via email to mrussell@usbr.gov .

<p>The 10th Contracting Squadron, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado intends to make a Sole Source award to Harness Rigging, Inc. for the purchase of 300 Student Harness/Container modifications and 300 Deployment Bag Reserves. This procurement is for the acquisition of a sole source commercial item using simplified procedures in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 451110 and the size standard is $14 Million.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirement:</span></p>
<p>The 98th Training Squadron requires the modification of 300 Telesis 3.0 Student Harness/Container Systems. The proposed modifications include:<br />&bull; Riser cover upgraded to magnetic configuration<br />&bull; Ring cover flap upgrade to integrated radio pocket<br />&bull; Harness modification - Lower leg strap and leg pad replacement</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sole Source Justification:</span></p>
<p>Only one responsible source and no other item will satisfy the current USAFA requirement. Rigging Innovations, Inc. as the manufacturer of the Telesis 3.0 parachute harness/containers system, manufactured under Federal Aviation Administration technical standard order (TSO) c23c, is the only authorized entity to perform the requested modifications. As the manufacturer of the Telesis 3.0 Student Harness/Container Systems, Rigging Innovations, Inc. is the only authorized company to make modification. Allowing any other company to make the modifications required to the Harness/Containers would void the manufacturer's warranty.</p>
<p><br />This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. DO NOT submit a bid/quote at this time.</p>
<p>Any offerors believing they can provide the required authorized modifications to the Telesis 3.0 Student Harness/Containers Systems to include the above and functions of the requirement described above may provide evidence for consideration. Evidence must support the offeror's claim they can provide this authorized modification. All qualified sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by this agency. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement can be conducted. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received NLT 08:00 am MDT on 30 May 2011. Responses received after this will be considered late IAW FAR 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this announcement. Contractors must have a current registration with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov and with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov .</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Optonic Laboratories, of Orlando, Florida, for the purchase of a Spectrally Tunable Source OL490, to be used by the Optical Technology Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland <br />***NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.<br />(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -<br />(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or <br />(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C.2304(d)(1)(B) or U.S.C.253(d)(1)(B).<br />***** Sole source determination is based on the need to purchase a replacement Spectrally Tunable Source OL490 from Optronic Laboratories. The operating software has already been developed to integrate with other existing optical controller equipment (microscope, stage, liquid crystal filters, gas pressure controller, and microfludic device). <br />Substitution with a unit from another vendor will require new optics and assembly, including rewriting of the software program.

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract award on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) "Only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" to American Maritime Officers Safety & Education Plan, (DBA) Simulation Training, Assessment & Research (STAR) 2 West Dixie Hwy Dania Beach FL 33004-4312.  The service is to provide a ship simulator numerical modeling application that uses multiple dedicated computers and appropriate visual display equipment, capable of accepting real-time interactive input that is processed and reflected in resulting output during deep-draft vessel trial runs through an engineered navigation operational scenario.  The ship simulator is an engineering design tool.  The simulator is a generic tool that becomes focused and relevant when the visual scene, engineering plan geometry, and harbor pilots are all associated with a particular harbor and engineering design project. SIC Code is 8249, NAICS Code is 611519, and Size standard is $7.0 M. <br>     The sole source determination is based upon STAR,  market research has shown this company being the only vendor that can provide the required ship simulator is a numerical modeling application that uses multiple dedicated computers and appropriate visual display equipment, capable of accepting real-time interactive input that is processed and reflected in resulting output during deep-draft vessel trial runs through an engineered navigation operational scenario.  The ship simulator is an engineering design tool.  The simulator is a generic tool that becomes focused and relevant when the visual scene, engineering plan geometry, and harbor pilots are all associated with a particular harbor and engineering design project needed.  The US Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District has joined in an agreement with the Port of Palm Beach to conduct a feasibility study that will consider expansion of The Port's deep-draft navigation facilities to accommodate expected future increase of visiting fleet vessel size.  Current practice within the US Army Corps of Engineers requires the engineer to examine and test the final design width of deep-draft channels and turning basin diameters with virtual ship simulators.  The simulator creates a realistic real-time navigation experience through the presentation of visual scene dynamics accurately coupled with horizontal vessel responses resulting from vessel maneuvers executed by experienced harbor pilots commanding the controls on the simulator bridge.  The dynamic visual component is accurately referenced to the engineering plan of the overall study area including each channel and turning basin feature.  The ship simulator is a numerical modeling application that uses multiple dedicated computers and appropriate visual display equipment, capable of accepting real-time interactive input that is processed and reflected in resulting output during deep-draft vessel trial runs through an engineered navigation operational scenario.  STAR, has developed a simulator model of Palm Beach Harbor that includes access to the harbor through its entrance channel, Lake Worth Inlet.  The model domain also includes the northern areas of the Port of Palm Beach.  STAR developed the model at the direction of the Port Authority to study cruise ship vessel access to a new cruise terminal and associated vessel berths during the planning and engineering work conducted for those facilities.  Development of the STAR model was funded by the Port of Palm Beach Port Authority, and the model remains the property of the Port.  The model is maintained at STAR.  Its associated computer files were generated at STAR, and are compatible only with the computer software that controls the ship simulation equipment at STAR.  Justification of Sole Source is based on the following three facts:  1) Use of the STAR model, as opposed to development of a new model beginning with initial site reconnaissance and data collection followed by "building" the functioning model domain, will save the government an amount estimated at approximately $80,000.  2) The Port of Palm Beach Port Authority is a study partner in our feasibility study.  The Port of Palm Beach Port Authority expects that the Corps will use the existing STAR model to design and test the proposed alternatives that are a part of our joint effort to improve the Port.  3) The Harbor Pilots who assume command of all deep-draft vessels operating within Palm Beach Harbor participated in the engineering study focused on the planning and design of the cruise terminal mentioned above.  <br>     This Notice of Intent is not a request for proposals. Information received from interested parties will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses to this electronic notice must be received by 10:00 a.m. EST on June 6, 2011. Responses may be submitted by E-mail to Jesse Lugo: jesse.lugo@usace.army.mil<br>

<DESC>This is a SPECIAL NOTICE. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. The Corps of Engineers Mobile District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) within the Redstone, AL and surrounding area. A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br><br>Offerors are requested to respond to this Special Notice with the following information. <br><br>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in Fort Rucker, AL and surrounding area?<br>(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br>(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br>(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br>(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br>(6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA?<br>(7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a<br>Mobile Engineer District contract?<br><br>Interested Offerors shall respond to this Special Notice no later than 26 May 2011. NLT 2:00 PM CST. Mail, or E-mail your response to U.S. Army Engineer District Mobile, Attn: CESAM-CT/Ms. Kelly Hallstrom, P.O. Box 2288, Mobile, AL 36628; E-mail - kelly.a.hallstrom@usace.army.mil.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p><br />This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), using a two-step Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, is soliciting abstracts to conduct concept exploration R&D in support of the Army's Science and Technology (S&T) program entitled Aircrew Survivability Technologies (AST). This AST program is a 6.2 Applied Research effort encompassing four years (FY12-15) with the intent of making at least one award in each of the four topic areas.  The AST program will develop technologies in the areas of conventional threat protection, crashworthiness, advanced fuel containment systems, and directed energy weapons (DEW) threat protection, with the intent of substantially improving aircrew survivability over current capabilities. The first step in the two-step process consists of receipt and review of abstracts summarizing the project that is to be the subject of a proposal. The purpose of abstract review is to foster competition, provide feedback to prospective Offerors relative to the likelihood of being funded so that better decisions can be made regarding incurring cost for proposal submission. Abstract feedback will be provided to facilitate an Offeror's decision on whether to prepare a full proposal. AATD response to an abstract is advisory only.  The abstract should provide enough information to permit review against the evaluation criteria.  Feedback will consist of a qualitative assessment and recommendation relative to full proposal submission. The second step in the two-step process consists of receipt and evaluation of proposals from which award decisions will be made.  Offerors who do not submit an abstract are permitted to submit a full proposal.  Every proposal will be subjected to the same comprehensive evaluation.  Submission of a full proposal is necessary in order to receive an award under this announcement.  There will be two abstract and proposal evaluation cycles as further discussed under General Information.  The two-step approach benefits Offerors by allowing them to disband proposal teams (if desired) after the abstract phase.  It benefits the Government by alleviating time wasted associated with evaluating proposals, which are not of sufficient technical interest/quality. <br><br>SOLICITATION TOPIC DESCRIPTIONS: There are four topics under this announcement: <br><br>TOPIC 01-2011: Conventional Threat Protection <br><br>The U.S. Army has an ongoing interest in developing and maturing advanced technologies that increase aircraft and crew protection against conventional ballistic threats.  Conventional ballistic threats are classified as small caliber threats, i.e. 7.62mm ball and armor piercing (AP), and 12.7mm AP, with 14.5mm AP as an objective for the future.  <br><br>Ballistic protection systems and materials have made significant advancements in recent years.  For example, compared to systems constructed from aramid fabrics and high hard steels, high density polyethylene (HDPE) and HDPE/ceramic composite solutions have demonstrated superior ballistic performance, with mass efficiency ratios (MER) on the order of five against ball and AP threats, respectively.  However, several fundamental issues still exist in armor and materials design that can lead to both weight and cost penalties. Fundamental to any armor's performance is its ability to absorb and/or dissipate ballistic impact energy.  Against ball threats, materials constructed from HDPE combine high tensile strength fibers with high interlaminer shear strength to absorb the kinetic energy of the projectile.  AP threat defeat mechanisms are more complicated, with energy dissipation capability a combination of the strike face properties and its interaction with a catcher material.  Intrinsic to this ability are aspects of dwell and impedance matching of the laminate bond. Current state-of-the-art systems incorporate the latest generation of materials and architectures to address these interactions, but tend to impose weight and/or cost penalties, due both to the materials used and their parasitic application. These limitations negatively affect range and payload capability of the aircraft. Therefore, designs incorporating lighter weight materials such as toughened ceramics and intermetallics with surface enhancements that promote dwell and increase fracture toughness; advanced impedance matched materials and bonding agents that improve impact wave acoustic absorption; innovative fabrication processes that reduce the number of constituents and/or improve processability; and non-traditional system design approaches offer the promise of weight savings leading to improved aircraft performance in range , weight, or payload, while improving the level of ballistic protection, as compared to traditional armor approaches.<br><br>The objective of this effort is to develop and demonstrate through test innovative light weight, high level of ballistic protection systems for rotorcraft application.  Proposed solutions should provide protection from small caliber threats at a threshold minimum of 50% reduced areal density as compared to current armor systems.  New materials, fabrication/processing techniques, and optimized system design technologies are expected to provide the greatest weight savings with potential for reducing production cost. The effectiveness of the armor design and supporting modeling and analysis tools used for the design shall be validated through ballistic test. <br><br>TOPIC 02-2011: Crashworthiness<br> <br>Recent Study on Rotorcraft Survivability mandated by Congress in 2009 concluded that crash is one of the key contributors to rotorcraft occupant fatalities. The effectiveness of some of the current passive crash protection subsystems have decreased with growth in aircraft gross weights and varying crash impact conditions. In addition, while current crash protection subsystems were designed for crashworthiness considerations only without considerations for crew endurance, aviation OPTEMPO during OIF/OEF has increased flight durations from 2-4 hours to 6-12 hours requiring uninterrupted, prolonged sitting which results in fatigue and short- and long-term physiological injuries.  Under the Advanced Aircrew Protection programs conducted in support of Aircrew Survivability Technologies (AST) Army Technology Objective (ATO) in FY08-11, an open system architecture for an active crash protection system (ACPS) concept was established and several active crash protection subsystems including external air bags with hybrid gas generators; restraint and head restraint system; landing gear system; energy attenuators for aircrew and troop seats; and integrated inflatable restraint system were developed.   An integrated ACPS with feedback controls can predict impending crashes or hard landing conditions and activate/control specific crash protection subsystems to manage crash impact energy attenuation more effectively than current passive subsystems, thus significantly improving occupant survivability for current and future military rotorcraft. <br><br>The intent of the FY12-15 Crashworthiness topic is to address subsystems constituents of crashworthiness for rotorcraft such as crashworthy aircrew and troop seats, landing gears systems, occupant restraint systems, crash sensing and activation systems, etc.  Building on technologies developed under the Advanced Aircrew Protection programs conducted in support of the AST ATO program in FY08-11, the topic objective is to develop and demonstrate innovative and advanced crash protection technologies to provide optimum, full spectrum crash protection for rotorcraft occupants while improving crew endurance with minimum impact on aircraft weight, cost, power, and operational capability.  The proposed crash protection subsystem/system shall provide a minimum 40% increase in impact energy attenuation over current subsystems/systems.<br><br>TOPIC 03-2011: Advanced Fuel Containment Systems<br><br>The US Army has ongoing interest in preventing fuel leakage from ballistic threat impacts. Continued emphasis on reduced system and subsystem weight has pushed the application of current material technologies to marginal levels of performance.  Recent testing of current state-of-the-art fuel cells has demonstrated marginal levels of self-sealing performance for the required protection level.  The need to reduce weight while maintaining ballistic and crashworthy performance remains.  Further weight reduction, while maintaining desired protection levels, is not possible using fielded conventional fuel cell materials and designs.  Current research efforts have shown that structural weight reductions on the order of 30%, obtained through the application of advanced design approaches and innovative materials can be obtained while maintaining performance levels per the latest revision of MIL-DTL-27422.  Additional weight savings may be expected through use of lightweight high efficiency sealing materials.  Moreover, DoD initiatives have emphasized the need for improved fuel efficiency, lower emissions, and alternative fuels, resulting in efforts to reformulate aviation fuels.  Changes in fuel formulations have brought into question the basis upon which self-sealing technologies function.  Consequently, current wound sealing techniques can no longer be the sole methodology in designing self-sealing systems.  Future fuel formulations require new approaches to self-sealing fuel tanks designs.  Chemical constituents of these new fuels need to be understood to facilitate development of new self-sealing protection schemes.        The objective of this topic is to develop new self-sealing fuel containment technologies that meet or exceed the requirements of MIL-DTL-27422, independent of fuel composition. <br><br><br>TOPIC 04-2011: Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) Threat Protection<br><br>The U.S. Army has a strong interest in developing and maturing advanced technologies that increase aircraft and crew protection against directed energy weapons (DEW) threats.   DEW threats include high energy lasers (HEL),and frequency agile low energy lasers (LEL).  Protecting Army helicopter systems and occupants from the effects of battlefield lasers is a formidable technical challenge.  Laser devices can damage aircraft transparencies or cause visual impairment either temporarily or permanently to the occupants.  Incorporating HEL and frequency agile LEL protection into helicopter canopies and windows is especially difficult and has been the objective of several research and development efforts in the past.  Many protection concepts and materials have been evaluated and in some cases, a significant level of laser protection has been achieved. However, there is no current single laser protection technology that meets all of the requirements for aircraft and crew protection, such as optical properties, tunability for varying wavelengths, weight, durability, cost, sustainability, manufacturability, and compatibility with night vision equipment.<br><br>The objective of the DEW threat protection program is to develop and demonstrate innovative and advanced technologies to provide aircraft and occupant protection against HELand frequency agile LELs with minimal impact on the aircraft transparency optical properties, weight, durability, cost, sustainability, manufacturability, and compatibility with night vision equipment.  The required protection levels are classified and will be provided as well as the Security Classification Guide for Laser Protection Materiel upon contract awards.<br><br>ANTICIPATED FUNDING AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD: Anticipated funding for all awards under the AST program is as follows: $ 2.147M in FY12, $2.232M in FY13 for the first cycle, $1.935M in FY 14, and $1.664M in FY15 for the second cycle.  It is the intent of the Government to make at least one award under each topic, subject to the availability of funds.  The range of anticipated amount of awards for each topic is as follows: $0-$500K in FY12; $0-$550K in FY13 for the first cycle and $0-$480K in FY14; and $0-$410K in FY15 for the second cycle.  It is desired that abstracts and proposals include a performance period of 15 to 20 months for the first cycle and 15- 24 months for the second cycle. Offerors should clearly depict their proposed schedule and ensure that the performance period for the first cycle will be completed by September 30, 2013 and for the second cycle by September 30, 2015.  All four topics have the potential for single or multiple awards, which may address only part of the topic objectives.  Any award made under this announcement is subject to the availability of funds.  <br><br>TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT: A variety of funding instruments are available depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must satisfy.  Such instruments include conventional contracts subject to the FAR, as supplemented, and Technology Investment Agreements (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358) or Other Transaction (OT) for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371), which are more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments. Under TIAs or OTs it is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost sharing of half of the cost of the project to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success. Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project. Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to Other Transactions for Research) accessible at the following link: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/321006r.htm.  Contract type is negotiable, but the Offeror's desire should be clearly stated in the cost proposal.<br><br> INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION AND SUBMITTAL OF ABSTRACTS: Guidance provided in this section applies to all abstracts submitted under this announcement.  Offerors may submit abstracts that address different topics or propose different solutions under a single topic and each will be evaluated independently. Offerors may also submit abstracts that address only part of the problem under a topic. Abstracts should be marked with the solicitation and topic number and shall not exceed five (5) pages in length. The five page limitation includes drawings, charts, etc.  The only exception to the five page count is the title page.  Page size shall not exceed 8 1/2 x 11 and a minimum font size of twelve (12) is required, with a minimum of one inch margins.  The evaluators will read only up to the maximum number of pages as specified above. <br><br>Abstracts shall include the following: 1. Proposed objectives, concepts, ideas, methodologies. 2. A clear statement of work citing specific tasks to be performed and approach to be taken; 3. Brief description of relevant past experience and capabilities; 4. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate delineating by fiscal year major cost items (e.g., labor, material, subcontracts, etc.) estimated number of labor hours and any proposed fee. 5. Funding Profile - desired funding by fiscal year shall be identified (in the event we incrementally fund).  All abstracts shall be submitted in four paper copies and electronic format on disc (PDF or MS Word) to the following address: Army Contracting Command, U.S. Army Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, Attn: CCAM-RDT (Ann Calvin), Building 401, Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, Virginia 23604-5577. Facsimile and electronic submission is not authorized under this announcement.<br><br> ABSTRACT EVALUATION/CRITERIA: Abstracts will be evaluated based on the following criteria: scientific merit, Offeror's capability, and the ROM cost. Once the abstracts are reviewed, all Offerors will be sent a decision letter providing a qualitative assessment and a Government recommendation relative to full proposal submission. Offerors whose abstracts are deemed to merit full proposal submission are invited to submit a proposal. Offerors whose abstracts are not selected for full proposal submission are still given the opportunity to submit a full proposal if they wish.  Due to the nature of abstracts, the Government will not offer a debriefing at this step of the BAA process. <br><br>PROPOSAL EVALUATION/CRITERIA: The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.  Each proposal will receive an adjectival rating supported by narrative.  The adjectival ratings and supporting narrative will be considered along with other factors including the extent of restrictions placed on technical data deliverables that limit the Government's ability to further exploit the results of the research and cost to the Government.  The Government will develop an order of merit listing for each topic and for each of the two evaluation cycles contemplated under this Announcement.  Proposed cost/cost to the Government will be evaluated, as appropriate, for realism and reasonableness. Any proposed cost share will be evaluated for its benefit in reducing program risk, achieving program objectives, and furthering the state-of-the-art. Any percentage of cost sharing proposed could result in greater evaluation credit. <br>The proposal evaluation criteria in descending order of importance are: (1) the extent to which the proposed work satisfies the Army research need by use of innovative, efficient, affordable, and suitable approaches to the stated technical problem; (2) the merit of the Offeror's proposed approach to accomplish the scientific and technical objectives; (3) the experience and qualifications of the scientists, engineers, technicians, and other proposed personnel; (4) the suitability and availability of proposed facilities; and (5) proposed cost to the Government<br><br>SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: Performance under Topics 01-2011, 02-2011, 03-2011, and 04-2011 will require access to and/or generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec. 2751 et. seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C. App 2401 et seq. Prior to award (if applicable), the successful offeror(s) will be required to provide an Export-Controlled DoD Data Agreement certification number issued in accordance with DoD Directive 52 30.25.  This certification may be requested from the US-Canada Joint Certification Office, Defense Logistics Information Service, Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI 49037-3084, Telephone 1-800-352-3572.  Pre-award access to or submission of a classified proposal is not authorized.  Performance under Topics 01-2011 and 04-2011 are expected to require access to and/or generation of technical data classified up to the Secret level.  Offerors responding to those topics must have a facility clearance, storage capability and the personnel required to perform at the Secret level. Evidence of facility clearance, storage capability and personnel cleared to perform at the Secret level shall be provided with proposal submission.  <br><br>GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY:  It is the Offeror's responsibility to identify, coordinate, and furnish supporting documentation for proposed use of any Government furnished property/equipment. <br><br>DATA RIGHTS: The Government desires the maximum rights attainable to technical data and computer software and documentation developed/generated under any potential funding instrument awarded as a result of this Announcement. Therefore, the Offeror shall identify any technical data and/or computer software that they would intend to deliver with restrictions on use, reproduction or disclosure. See DFARS 227.71 for further information.  <br><br>DATA DELIVERABLES: All awards under this announcement will require data deliverables which will be specifically negotiated between the parties. The following data items can be anticipated to be required for all awards: (1) Contract Performance Management Plan; (2) Technical & Cost Performance Report; (3) Test Plan; (4) Test Report; and (5) Final Report <br><br>INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION AND SUBMITTAL OF PROPOSALS: <br>Guidance provided in this section applies to submission of proposals under this Announcement.  Offerors may submit proposals that address different topics or propose different solutions under a single topic and each will be evaluated independently.  Offerors may also submit proposals that address only part of the problem under a topic. The proposal shall consist of two volumes, a technical volume and a cost volume. In presenting the proposal material, prospective Offerors are advised that the quality of the information is significantly more important than quantity.  Offerors should confine the submissions to essential matters providing sufficient information to define their offer and establish an adequate basis for the Government to conduct its evaluation.  AATD encourages and promotes teaming arrangements with research organizations to include academia, industry, and small businesses in order to achieve a mix of relevant expertise and capabilities for executing research and development efforts.  Proposals should be marked with the solicitation and topic number. <br><br>TECHNICAL VOLUME: The Technical Volume shall provide detail that justifies the selection of the technologies proposed to include benefits of the proposed technology relative to the topic objectives. A plan to develop and transition the technology to current or future Army aircraft shall also be included. The technical volume shall include a clear statement of the technical objectives and the specific approach to be pursued and supporting background experience.  It shall contain a Statement of Research Effort (SORE), milestones, a biographical section describing key personnel, a description of the facilities and/or data sources to be employed in the effort, and a program management section.

For consistency, the Offeror shall submit other than cost or pricing data in the format suggested by FAR 15.403-5(b)(1), or in contractor's format containing the information outlined below, together with supporting breakdowns. The supporting schedules may include summary level estimating rationale used to generate the proposed costs.  Information such as historical cost information, judgment, analogy to other similar efforts, etc. are generally accepted methods of projecting labor expenditures.  Purchase order history, catalog prices, vendor quotations, engineering estimates, etc. are generally accepted methods of projecting material requirements. The cost proposal shall not contain overflow of information suited for the technical proposal.  The Offeror shall assure any overlap of data, (such as man-hours) does not conflict between the cost and technical proposal. In the case of any conflict between the two, information in the cost proposal will take precedence.  The Cost Proposal should include the following: (1) Funding - A funding profile by month and Government fiscal year (October-September). If proposing a cost share, display that share with the particular government funding and fiscal year. (2) Proposal Validity Period - Include date that proposal expires. Proposals will only be considered for award as stated in General Information and only during the stated validity period. (3) Pricing breakdowns - The Cost breakdowns shall be presented in three formats; a) Total Program Level - Present all costs by cost category (including applicable rates and factors) by year (calendar or contractor year used to develop proposed rates and factors). b) Task Level - Present all costs by cost category by task level by Government fiscal year. c) If proposing a cost share, display each share for each Government fiscal year. (4) Subcontractor Costs - The Offeror shall submit all subcontractor cost proposals and its proposal analyses with the cost proposal. Subcontractor proposals, if applicable, shall include all the same pricing requirements and be provided concurrent with the prime contractor's submission or due to any proprietary nature of the proposal, the subcontractor can submit the more detailed proposal directly to the Government.  (5) Facilities Capital Cost of Money - If Facilities Capital Cost of Money is claimed, a properly executed DD Form 1861 is required in support of the dollars proposed.  (6) If applicable, Security Clearance Information (specified in the Security Requirements Section) and the Subcontracting Plan (specified in the Subcontracting Plan Section) (if applicable).  Provide Separate Summary Tables for the following cost elements: (1) Man-hours - Provide a summary table that shows man-hours by task without cost detail.   Assure these documented man-hours do not conflict with the proposed man-hours in the technical proposal. (2) Rates and Factors - Provide a rate table by year for all labor and overhead rates and pricing factors.  If Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) is in existence, that should be included, along with the Administrative Contracting Officer's (ACO's) contact information. (3) Other Direct Costs - Provide a summary table by task that reflects all proposed direct costs by cost categories.  For example, Travel - Provide a summary table of destinations, number of trips, traveler's days, and unit prices for airfare and per diem for proposed travel. Material/Equipment - For material costs, identify what will be purchased and the basis for the estimated cost, e.g. vendor quote, engineering estimate, etc.  In addition, if a proposal submitted in response to this solicitation is similar or substantially the same as another proposal that has been funded, is now being funded, or is pending with another Federal Agency or DoD component or the same DoD component, the proposer must so indicate in the Cost Volume of the Proposal and provide the following information: contract number (if applicable); Agency, Agency Point of Contact name, email and phone number.<br><br>Included as an attachment to the announcement is the SUBCONTRACTING PLAN: (Not applicable if proposing award under a non-FAR instrument (i.e., a TIA) or if offeror is a SMALL BUSINESS CONCERN).  Pursuant to the requirements of FAR part 19.702(a)(1), if the total amount of the proposal exceeds $650,000, and there are subcontracting possibilities, Offerors must submit a subcontracting plan.  FAR part 52.219-9 defines a subcontracting plan and its requirements.  Offerors shall incorporate the subcontracting plan as part of the Offeror's proposal submission. DFARS 226.370-8 discusses subcontracting incentives and goals with the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions.  DFARS 219.708(b)(1)(A) and (B), discusses the appropriate use of DFARS Clauses 252.219 -7003 and 252.219-7004 in solicitations and contracts related to small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small business subcontracting plans.  Offerors are cautioned that in solicitations where subcontracting opportunities exist, the Government will not execute a contract unless the Contracting Officer determines that the negotiated plan provides the maximum practicable opportunity for SBs, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, and Veteran-owned Small Business concerns or HBCUs/MIs to participate in the performance of the contract. Offerors should note that DFARS 219.705-4 provides for a goal of 5% for SDB concerns and HBCUs/MIs.<br><br>DEBRIEFINGS:  When requested, the Government will provide a debriefing. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in FAR 15.506 but the debriefing content will be tailored to comply with the procedures set out in FAR 35.016 governing BAAs and the use of non-FAR based transactions. <br><br>GENERAL INFORMATION and EVALUATION/AWARD CYCLE DATES:  This BAA constitutes the total solicitation.  There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may revise abstract or proposal due dates.  This announcement is open and valid through July 01, 2013 unless sooner cancelled.  `Abstracts and proposals may be submitted at any time during the open period of this announcement.  The Government anticipates making at least one award under each topic area, subject to availability of funds and proposals of rated as eligible for funding, and there are two cycles of planned potential awards, depending on funding availability. Abstracts and proposals can be submitted any time during the open period of this announcement but will be processed in the cycle based upon date of receipt and proposal validity period.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation in accordance with FAR Part 12.  No other solicitation will be issued; proposals are being requested via this notice.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) enforces federal laws and regulations relating to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, explosives and arson.  The law and regulations (18 U.S.C. ? 923(f)(2) and 27 CFR, part 478, subpart E) provide for a hearing if an applicant or licensee requests one upon receipt of a notice of license denial or revocation.  ATF requires contractor services for these hearings.  ATF will award multiple blanket purchase agreements (BPA) as a result of this notice.  The Firearms and Explosives Industry Services Division (FEISD) will monitor the hearings.  Contract hearing officers who are under contract with the ATF shall be known as Special Hearing Officers.  Special Hearing Officers, hereinafter referred to as contractor(s), must possess sufficient abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by the FEISD.  The abilities needed to successfully serve in this capacity necessitate the use of retired law enforcement Special Agents, Inspectors, Attorneys and Officers as Special Hearing Officers.  Each contractor, when conducting a hearing, is representing the ATF.  The ATF expects such representation to reflect positively on the Bureau.  To that end, contractors, when conducting hearings, must present themselves in a professional manner.  Upon completion of a hearing assignment each contractor must submit the following items to the FEISD: 1) Hard copy of the Hearing Officer Report; 2) Disk or CD containing the Hearing Officer Report; 3) Audio tape(s) of the hearing; 4) Completed Contractor Invoice for Payment; and 5) Attachments/exhibits as stated in the Hearing Officer Report.  These items must be hand delivered to the FEISD or shipped using Federal Express or other authorized carrier.  Hearing Officer Reports shall be submitted within ten business days of the completion of the hearing.  If a contractor determines that he or she cannot meet the due date for a particular report, the contractor must seek an extension from the FEISD.  Each contractor is responsible for ensuring that all of their reports are neatly prepared, grammatically correct, free of spelling errors, and most importantly, factually accurate.  Hearing Officer Reports must be able to stand up to de novo judicial review in U.S. District Court if necessary.  Repeated inaccuracies or discrepancies will result in the contract being terminated.  Hearing Officer Reports must objectively state the facts as presented during the hearing.  The hearing shall be recorded using an audio tape recorder, which will be provided by the Bureau and operated by the hearing officer.  The tape, along with the exhibits, shall constitute the official record of the hearing.  Contractors will be required to conduct the hearing, review the tape recording (post-hearing), take accurate notes of the hearing, and reduce those notes to writing in the form of a Hearing Officer Report.  In order to receive assignments and to complete the required Hearing Officer Reports, each contractor must possess, or have access to, certain equipment, and possess the knowledge to use it.  The following equipment and related software programs are required: 1) A personal computer with a Windows? operating system, preferably Windows 98? or newer; 2) An Inkjet or LaserJet printer.

Microsoft Outlook Express?, standing alone, will not be sufficient.  Pre and post-hearing responsibilities, in many cases, requires the contractor to use his or her personal telephone, cellular telephone, FAX machine, or other related equipment.  ATF assumes no responsibility for the purchase, maintenance, use or misuse of these devices. ATF will reimburse the contractor for reasonable and necessary FAX transmittals and long-distance telephone calls made in connection with the conduct of a hearing.  Local telephone calls or cellular airtime charges will not be reimbursed.  Each contractor must make every reasonable effort to protect data associated with a hearing.  Audiotapes, notes, exhibits, copies of Hearing Officer Reports, etc. are the sole property of ATF and must be safeguarded against unlawful disclosure.

The contractor is to destroy all notes and material at that time.  Identification media, ATF-provided software, and all other Government property must be surrendered when requested by the FEISD.

ATF assumes no responsibility for the purchase or maintenance of a contactor facility, nor will ATF reimburse any contractor for use of such facility.  Contractors must be able to conduct hearings within a 200-mile radius of their home.  Contractors are expected to possess an automobile with appropriate insurance coverage. ATF assumes no liability for contractor misconduct or negligence while driving their personal automobile in connection with their hearing assignments.  When using their personal automobile in connection with performing assignments, contractors will be reimbursed for mileage driven at the prevailing rate established by the General Services Administration.

This investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the Personnel Security Branch, and be performed under such standards as the Personnel Security Branch may establish.  The contractor is advised that this investigation may take 90 days or more to complete, depending upon the complexities of the issues.  Failure to timely complete the required background forms, or failure to have a background investigation favorably adjudicated constitutes grounds for disqualification of the contractor.  Should the contractor be disqualified, he or she will not be granted unescorted access to any ATF facility, and access to ATF proprietary information or data will not be authorized.  Contractors are responsible for notifying the Personnel Security Branch of any changes in personnel information.

<DESC><p>The Metaphor Program will exploit the fact that metaphors are pervasive in everyday talk and reveal the underlying beliefs and worldviews of members of a culture. In the first phase of the two-phase program, performers will develop automated tools and techniques for recognizing, defining and categorizing linguistic metaphors associated with target concepts and found in large amounts of native-language text. The resulting conceptual metaphors will be validated using empirical social science methods. In the second phase, the program will characterize differing cultural perspectives associated with case studies of the types of interest to the Intelligence Community. Performers will apply the methodology established in the first phase and will identify the conceptual metaphors used by the various protagonists, organizing and structuring them to reveal the contrastive stances.</p>
<p>IARPA invites the private sector to assist it with operationally testing its new web-based electronic proposal submission system. IARPA has recently brought IARPA Distribution and Evaluation System (IDEAS) on-line, and seeks industry assistance with operationally testing and validating the system's performance.</p>
<p>In addition to delivering proposals to the McLean, VA address listed in BAA Section 4.C.2., IARPA encourages offerors to upload their proposal documents to the website at https://iarpa-ideas.gov. However, submitting proposals to IDEAS is not a requirement and is not a substitute for delivering proposals in accordance with BAA Section 4.C.2. Moreover, the Government will not evaluate proposal documents submitted to IDEAS. Rather, submissions to IDEAS will be compared to your formal submission for completeness only, to enable IARPA leadership to make a decision to move to Full Operating Capability for this new web-based system.</p>
<p>As stated in BAA Section 4.A.1., reviewers receive the electronic copy submitted by CD. Hard copies are primarily for archival purposes. In the case of inconsistencies between the hard copy and the CD copy, the CD copy takes precedence.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. The NAICS is 721110 and the Small Business Size Standard is $6 million.</p>
<p>A. IDENTIFICATION<br />The Small Business Administration, Field Operations Headquarters intends to block single occupancy sleeping rooms, meeting space, meals, and audio/visual (A/V) event production services for general session presentations for SBA's Business Development Specialists and supervisors and senior leaders from the Office of Government Contracting/Business Development and Office of Field Operations, which must accommodate 300 attendees.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVES<br />The long-term strength of this agency as a high performing organization is critically linked to our frontline leaders. For an organization our size, our frontline leaders are critical to the organization's ability to be nimble and successful. This training conference is intended to improve the delivery of our Government Contracting and Business Development programs. <br />The goals of this conference are:</p>
<p>1. To provide a level understanding among all BDS' regarding the significant program changes that become effective during FY 2011 and FY 2012; <br />2. To establish and train BDS' on standard documents, processes and systems that are pertinent to delivering SBA's government contracting programs; and <br />3. To give BDS' the skills to identify and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse within SBA's government contracting programs.</p>
<p>C. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The SBA Business Development Specialist Training Conference is aimed at SBA's Business Development Specialists, supervisors, and senior leaders from the Office of Capital Access and Office of Field Operations. The conference will consist of a series of lectures, presentations, training sessions, interactive breakout sessions, and sharing of ideas, best practices and lessons learned.</p>
<p>A small preparatory group will arrive on Sunday, June 26th. They will need to have a pre-conference meeting with the facility staff and a tour of the facility on the morning of Monday, June 27th. The remaining large contingent of the conference attendees will arrive throughout the day of Monday, June 27th. Attendees will be arriving from the entire United States.</p>
<p>Hotel staff will have conference rooms and all hotel provided equipment setup no later than 7:00 am each morning of the training event as agreed upon by the hotel and SBA's on-site representative. This includes any hotel provided audio-visual equipment.</p>
<p>On the first day of the training event (Tuesday June 28th), the hotel's audio-visual technician will be available from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm to assist SBA's presenters with their personal audio-visual equipment setup. Actual start time may change based on final training schedule. SBA's on-site representative will confirm actual day and time audio-visual technician is needed. On-site technical support expertise in audio-visual equipment setup and trouble-shooting necessary to resolve routine audio-visual malfunctions is required. Daily, during the hours of 8:00 am and 5:00 pm, hotel's audio-visual staff must be available to provide technical support within 30 minutes of the hotel being notified by SBA's presenters or on-site representative.</p>
<p>SBA's lead contact and on-site representative for all training events is Ms. Susan Nassaux, Field Operations Specialist. Ms. Nassaux may provide additional SBA on-site representatives who may be serving as alternate Agency on-site representatives for specific training events during the performance period.</p>
<p>D. HOTEL LOCATION, QUALITY AND ACCOMMODATIONS<br />The conference space will be used as a training classroom. This will require one large banquet room with unobstructed interior views large enough for various training room configurations/setups (classroom, U-shape, circles, etc) to comfortably accommodate approximately 300 participants. Likewise, SBA may need a second smaller work room to comfortably accommodate approximately 15-20 participants. At a minimum, both rooms must be Internet accessible and may require standard audio-visual presentation equipment (LCD projectors, microphones/lavalieres, projector screen (or 60" or larger LED/LCD/HD TV screen), connection cables, power cords) technical support and setup available for training presenters. Conference rooms and audio-visual equipment must be reserved solely for SBA for the duration of the event.</p>
<p>In order to meet SBA requirements, all conference and meeting spaces must be contiguous or in very close proximity (line of sight preferred) to each other. The banquet room space, where the General Sessions will be held will be the main focus of the conference; therefore, the space shall be visually appealing. The banquet rooms space shall comfortably accommodate up to 300 adults. The second meeting room shall be required to comfortably accommodate 15 to 20 adults for smaller work-related meetings. All program space must be blocked for the sole use of SBA for the duration of the conference. Spaces shall be clean, well ventilated, well lit, adequately soundproofed and handicapped accessible.</p>
<p>Guest rooms will be individually occupied. All must have TVs, included Internet access, and be contemporary, handicapped accessible, and able to offer refrigerators upon request. Guest rooms must be provided at a rate at or below the Government approved rate of $132/night. A list of attendees will be provided at the time of contract award to create the reservations. The entire event including guest rooms will be contracted and invoiced against as a single contract. Attendees will furnish a credit card at check-in for incidentals and personal expenses only. Two upgraded guest rooms are requested to be provided at the Government approved rate of $132/night and must be large enough to accommodate small informal meetings of 10-12 people. The total estimated number of guest rooms needed per night is:</p>
<p>Date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of Rooms</p>
<p>Sunday, June 26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50<br />Monday, June 27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 300<br />Tuesday, June 28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 300<br />Wednesday, June 29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300<br />Thursday, June 30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 300<br />Friday, July 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depart</p>
<p>The hotel shall guarantee SBA participants' guest room reservations and rates for five business days prior to scheduled event.</p>
<p>Due to the Agency's mission to be able to provide immediate support to America's small business community on a moment's notice, SBA requires flexibility in its ability to change the number of participants' guest rooms reserved. SBA will guarantee 85% occupancy rate of its participants' guest room without penalty.</p>
<p>Hotel on-site parking available to accommodate 20 participants' vehicles at no additional charge.</p>

Meals will be served (buffet style preferred) at predetermined times as during normal meal hours as agreed upon by the hotel and SBA's on-site representative. SBA's training schedule will indicate planned meal hours. SBA's on-site representative will confirm meal plan hour with hotel's representative at least one week prior to training start date. However, due to the nature of training, the parties anticipate the need to have some reasonable flexibility in actual meal schedules as not to disrupt the training.</p>

With 300 conference attendees arriving at the property at one time, hotel must have a plan/staff to have check-in/check-out move quickly and efficiently.

SBA may require the front desk to hand out an informational welcome flyer to the attendees upon check-in. Express check-out via guestroom TV or under guestroom door invoicing is desired.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, hotel will provide SBA's on-site representatives a telephone directory of "key" hotel personnel assigned to supporting SBA during the conference. The telephone directory must include "key" personnel's business hours and telephone numbers (note a telephone answering service is not acceptable). At a minimum, the key personnel must be identified for check-in/out, guest room accommodations, audio-visual support, meal services, and conference room setup.</p>

Water samples will be collected monthly at up to 12 stations.  Analytical methods, detection limits and total number of samples to be analyzed are presented in Table 1.  Laboratory analytical procedures that follow U.S. EPA approved methods (APHA et al. 1992, 2000; U.S. EPA 1983, 1984) and can meet the detection limits presented in Table 1 shall be deemed acceptable.  These methods and detection limits will enable direct comparison of analytical results with these criteria.  However, it is anticipated that extremely low concentrations of phosphorus, nitrogen, and mercury exists at district projects mandating that the water quality laboratory use ultra-clean analytical techniques and that the laboratory provide ultra-low detection limits for phosphorus, nitrogen, and mercury.

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>The Contractor shall have all licenses and permits required by Federal, state, and local laws to perform hazardous substance(s) removal or disposal services.

<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>INSPECTIONS</p>
<p>Except as specified elsewhere, the U.S. Coast Guard shall rely on the Contractor to accomplish all inspection and testing needed to ensure that the work conforms to contract quality requirements.</p>
<p>Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the term of this contract and for such longer period as may be specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>The name and telephone number of the U.S. Coast Guard Inspector will be provided after the award of a contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p><br />GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p>METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR:</p>
<p>Invoices submitted by the Contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.212-4 will be returned. Invoices shall include (see the clause for a full summation of invoice requirements):</p>

<p>The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is the primary identifier in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), (see FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Central Contractor Registration (OCT 2003)). Contractors are located and identified in CCR by their DUNS number. Therefore, to facilitate payment, the DUNS number shall be recorded on every invoice submitted to the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified by the designated billing office and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as accurate and complete.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the Contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration.</p>
<p>Additional work verbally agreed to by the parties that has not yet been incorporated into the contract by modification shall not be included in an invoice. Payments will not be made for any work to which a modification has not been properly executed. Invoices submitted for payment that includes such a request will be reduced by the unmodified amount.</p>
<p>The original and one copy of the invoice shall be mailed to the designated billing office, as follows:<br /><br />U. S. Coast Guard <br />Surface Forces Logistics Center<br />Attn: Dianne Jackson, CPD/C&amp;P2/IBCT<br />1301 Clay Street, OFB Suite 807N<br />Oakland, CA 94612-5249</p>

<p>"THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER (to be assigned upon contract award)"</p>
<p>NOTE: 10% OF THE TOTAL CONTRACT PRICE WILL BE WITHHELD UNTIL ALL DELIVERABLES, REQUIRED BY THE CONTRACT, ARE RECEIVED AND ACCEPTED.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<CONTACT>George R Woods, Contracts Administrator, Phone 631-344-2223, Fax 631-344-5667, Email gwoods@bnl.gov
<DESC>Amendment #1
<p>This amendment #1 to RFP 193588 is issued to provide answers to offeror generated questions.</p>
<p>Specifically this RFP is modified as follows:</p>
<p>The following Offeror generated questions and corresponding answers are provided.</p>
<p>Question #1<br />The drawing PD COM HU 2100 Rev A shows a guillotine for a lead shielding enclosure. See section 3.2.3 of specification; can you confirm the thickness of the lead that we have to fix on the downstream enclosure?<br />Answer #1<br />Unless otherwise indicated in the enclosure drawings or in Appendix 1 of the Specifications, the lead beamstop requirements (including dimensions) are specified in section 3.2.3. Guillotine requirements are specified in section 3.10 (in particular, reference section 3.10.4). To add further clarification, if lead is used for the guillotine blades, the total thickness of lead (in each set of guillotine blades) must minimally be half the required thickness of steel guillotines of the wall to which it is attached. Alternately, if steel is used for the guillotine blades, the total thickness of steel for the guillotine blades must be equal to or greater than the required thickness of steel of the wall to which it is attached. If lead is used for guillotine blades, please note that the requirements of section 3.1.3.2 apply.</p>
<p>Question #2<br />The steel panels forming the walls of the enclosure, we have to do a frame steel like for the lead shielding enclosure, but concerning the steel panels, must they be manufactured with a single size steel as the lead without weld? these panels steel must they be of one piece? example size, height 3500mm* width 1000mm * thickness 6mm<br />Answer #2:<br />All enclosures must be built to withstand the roof loads specified in section 3.4.3 with adequate margin of safety. Additionally the walls shall be built with UniStrut attachments as specified in section 3.5. The walls must have sufficient strength to support the specified roof loads and to support reasonable loads applied by attachments to the internal and external UniStrut specified in section 3.5. Walls shall also meet minimum steel thickness requirements in all locations and shall be designed to assure adequate radiation protection (i.e. with no radiation leakage). The loads from attachments to UniStrut mounted on the walls have not been specified by BSA. Contractors should make conservative assumptions during the RFP phase. Additionally, section 4.1 specifies that enclosures shall be "visibly appealing" so that BSA will be proud to display the completed enclosures to visitors from around the world. Contractors are therefore not otherwise constrained in their design approach (i.e. integral or separate framing) as long as the completed product can be safely transported, assembled, and meets all of the requirements detailed within the Specifications and Statement of Work, including those mandated by New York State Building Code, NFPA, OSHA, and all other codes referenced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question #3<br />3-ID-C enclosure (reference drawing PD-HXN-HU-1310 RevA); details B and C: Who is to supply the steel sleeves? Is it the responsibility of the shielding contractor or the company supplying the concrete enclosure? It appears that these steel sleeves are to be cast in place in concrete.<br />Answer #3<br />Details B and C show sleeves that are cast in place by the concrete building contractor. They do not need to be supplied by the steel hutch contractor.</p>
<p>Question #4<br />3-ID-C enclosure. Please provide details for openings around doors for interface of metal doorframes to concrete.<br />Answer #4 <br />Note 2 of drawing PD-HXN-HU-1310 references vendor drawings A-401-N and A-402-N, neither of which was available at the time of this solicitation. These drawings along with ECN No. CP6-ECN-33 Dated 4-26-2011 are being provided separately as an attachment and are available for download from this website.</p>
<p><br />Except as noted herein, all requirements as set forth in RFP solicitation request 193588 remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Any questions should be addressed in writing to the attention of George Woods.</p>

Order will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. It is the responsibility of all interested offerors to monitor the solicitation for any possible amendments and changes. This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-50, effective 06 May 2011.</p>
<p>This solicitation is being set-aside for small businesses only. The solicitation number is HU0001-11-Q-1427. The applicable NAICS code is 561621-Security System Services, and the size standard is $12.5 million in annual receipts.</p>
<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>In accordance with the following, this is a requirement for maintenance and security services to be performed at the USUHS:</p>
<p>1. General Requirements</p>
<p>Contractor must provide all labor, supervision, tools, equipment, parts, computers (turnkey), technical support, hardware, software, user training and material to perform on-site technical support, preventive maintenance, and repairs (emergency and non-emergency) of the Casi-Rusco access control system and all associated equipment, miscellaneous alarm and surveillance equipment.</p>
<p>2. Description of Work</p>
<p>The adjustment and repair of the surveillance system includes all computer equipment, software updates, locks (readers), crash bars, and video equipment (monitors, VCR, cameras). Provide the manufacturer's required adjustments and all other work necessary.</p>
<p>3. Maintenance Support</p>
<p>a. The Contractor must provide maintenance support for the equipment listed under Heading 10, Security System Composition.</p>
<p>b. The Government requires the Contractor to provide the following specific levels of maintenance support:</p>
<p>b.1 Remote Support - this support will assist on-site Government personnel to verify the nature of a system problem prior to initiating a request for on-site maintenance support. This support is to be available on a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week basis. Remote diagnostic capability must be provided in order to perform minor troubleshooting and/or software repairs.</p>
<p>b.2 Remedial Maintenance - includes maintenance, which is performed by the Contractor on-site, as required. This support is to be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Remedial maintenance shall be treated as emergency maintenance to be performed. Response shall be within two (2) hours, as provided under Heading 5, Response Time. It shall be performed as required on an unscheduled basis.</p>
<p>b.3 Preventive Maintenance (PM) - shall include all preventive maintenance as required on the listed equipment under 10, Security System Composition. Contractor should provide at least two (2) preventive maintenance calls during the year. PMs shall be scheduled by mutual consent between the Contractor and the Government, and shall not interfere with normal Government operations.</p>
<p>4. Technical Support</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specifically provided in this contract, the quality of all services rendered hereunder must conform to the highest standards in the relevant profession, trade or field of endeavor. All services must be rendered by or supervised directly by individuals fully qualified in the relevant profession, trade or field, and holding any licenses required by law.</p>
<p>The Contractor must provide the Government with the telephone number of a primary point of contact for all on-call service/technical support.</p>
<p>Fully trained and competent maintenance personnel in accordance with the contract and the statement of work will provide maintenance coverage. "Fully trained" is defined as capable of performing required maintenance without trial and error, or in effect, without learning on the job at the expense of this contract. Personnel who are "in training" will not be utilized except as observers and helpers to qualified personnel. If during the performance of the contract, the Contracting Officer questions the adequacy of the qualifications of personnel assigned to this contract, the Contractor will have the burden of proving the personnel meet requirements.</p>
<p>During the scheduled visit the tech will provide preventive maintenance checks of all the security equipment to verify that all systems are working properly and document findings. As needed, the tech will make repairs/adjustments to malfunctioning equipment found during these checks and document this work. The tech must also be responsible for the following tasks during his scheduled time on-site:</p>
<p>a. Respond to service calls and make necessary repairs to system and related equipment.</p>
<p>b. Perform security system troubleshooting to isolate malfunctioning system components.</p>
<p>c. Remove and replace defective equipment and ensure new equipment is operating properly.</p>
<p>d. Maintain documentation on all maintenance, repairs and warranty information on each piece of equipment</p>
<p>e. Assist the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) in resolving problems as needed.</p>
<p>f. Perform back up of all files.</p>

<p>h. Assist authorized SEC, LAM, and UIS personnel as needed to make changes with visitor access and badge software.</p>
<p>i. Perform preventive maintenance in accordance with the manufacturers' recommendation for all equipment.</p>
<p>5. Response Time</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Contractor to provide a level of support necessary to ensure that system problems do not cause downtime. Accordingly, the Government established requirement is that from the time the Government notifies the Contractor that a system problem exists, the Contractor must respond within two (2) hours. If an on-site response is required, the Contractor must respond within four (4) hours. Within this response time interval, the Contractor may initially (so as to reduce system downtime) telephonically respond directly to on-site government personnel with appropriate instructions, which may return the system to full operation.</p>
<p>6. Upgrades</p>
<p>The Contractor must support all software components and functional features of these items. This support must include troubleshooting and problem solution of current software products. Also, the Government requires that the Contractor make available any "patches" and future software updates and releases and supporting documentation as provided by the original manufacturer over the life of the contract.</p>

<DESC>Please note the following questions have been answered by the Grantee:
<p><br />Q: The original Task 8, "Conduct an Assessment of US Sources of Supply", from the desk study (page 165 of the RFP document Exhibit IV - Proposed Schedule for the Study) is not included in the Terms of Reference. As a result, the Terms of Reference (Annex I, RFP document page 193) has only 9 Tasks as oppose to 10 listed in the desk study. Is this task (Original Task 8 on Page 165) required as part of the RFP response even though it is not included on the Terms of Reference?</p>
<p>A: Yes, this work is still required. Task 8 in the budget "Conduct an Assessment of U.S. Sources of Supply" was actually rolled into the Final Report task of the Terms of Reference. The last paragraph of Task 9 in the Terms of Reference states: "The Final Report shall also include a comprehensive list of suppliers, including potential sources of U.S. equipment and services, relevant to the implementation of each component of the Project as outlined in the Study. The U.S. Suppliers list shall identify the capabilities, addresses and principal points of contact for each of the suppliers." As such, the Terms of Reference only shows 9 tasks, rather than 10, but the work was not eliminated.</p>
<p><br />Q.: The Desk study (Exhibit III, page 163) indicate schedule and effort by individual experts. Can bidders deviate from these estimated efforts (as long as financials are not impacted) per their proposed methodology?</p>
<p>A: This is a fixed price Study and the budget provided is a guide of what we estimate to be the level of effort required. You may alter these estimated efforts, but the fixed overall cost remains the same. You must ensure that the tasks can be successfully carried out as stated in the Terms of Reference.</p>

<p>Purpose: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IAW FAR 15.201(e). This notice is solely for market research and planning purposes and does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid, nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government to its ultimate acquisition approach. No award will be made from this Request For Information (RFI) and the Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice. The purpose of this RFI is to gather information from industry on establishing sustainment and enhancement activities for the Financial Information Resource SysTem (FIRST)/Force Structure Data Management (FSDM) system by gaining knowledge of potentially qualified sources and their size classifications (small business, large business, etc.) The Government considers information on market capabilities, common industry standards, latest technological advances, commercial terms, and conditions, timelines for adaptation and integration, and possible suppliers and sources to be helpful. All feedback and information received may be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for possible future acquisitions. Please do not request a copy of a solicitation because one does not exist.</p>
<p>Request for Information/Questions: The Financial Information Resource SysTem (FIRST)/ Force Structure Data Management (FSDM) is an Air Force Programming system designed to support development of the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and the President's Budget (PB). FIRST/FSDM maintains an inventory of the Air Force's force structure (organizations, weapon systems and flying hours) and enables the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS) to prioritize and program Air Force requirements. It also provides a historical query and analysis capability of 30+ years of Air Force budget data and submissions. It replaces and enhances the legacy Program Data System (PDS).</p>
<p>FIRST/FSDM features a modern system architecture that is hosted on the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) classified integration framework (IF) utilizing the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). FIRST/FSDM is web-based, utilizing the Oracle 11i Application Suite. Cognos Business Intelligence is used for "what-if" analysis, ad hoc reporting, and reports generation. FIRST/FSDM maximizes the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products and GCSS-AF Services to deliver a system that provides a sustainable flexible, user-friendly information system.</p>
<p>In order to develop any potential acquisition strategy the following information would be useful:</p>
<p>1. Estimated cost of service<br />2. Estimated transition time to provide the service<br />3. Service delivery options (i.e., provide service to service delivery point and provide service to the user)<br />4. Possible peripheral or allied support required from the government.<br />5. What performance metrics could be made available to the government related to usage?<br />6. Any other aspects that should be considered by the government as it refines the requirement and potentially develops an acquisition strategy?<br />7. Any inputs concerning the NAICS and SBA size standards that should be considered for any potential RFP?<br />If additional information is required to formulate your response to this RFI, request the information through the POC listed below. A site survey cannot be accomodated at this time. <br /><br />Responses: This RFI is prepared for planning purposes only and is not restricted to small business. If the government decides to pursue an RFP, portions of your RFI response may be incorporated into the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Sources are discouraged from submitting any information deemed competition-sensitive or proprietary. However, if sources elect to submit competition-sensitive or proprietary information, sources bear sole responsibility for marking said information as such to ensure appropriate safeguarding by the Government. The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>
<p>1) RFI responses must include company name, address, at least one designated point of contact, voice, and fax telephone numbers, and an email address.<br /><br />2) Please include your Business Type, i.e., Small, Small disadvantaged, Women-owned, Hub Zone, Service-disabled veteran-owned, 8(a), large business, and etc.<br /><br />3) All responses shall be provided on white paper outlining the company's responses, not to exceed 7 pages, single-spaced, Times New Roman, 12 font.</p>
<p>4) All questions and responses to our request for information/questions shall be submitted, via e-mail, to marcus.abrams@maxwell.af.mil; anthony.sandoval@maxwell.af.mil; and jacqueline.threat-tellis@maxwell.af.mil.</p>
<p>After review of the responses to this RFI, the Government may or may not proceed with an acquisition. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for any new information related to this RFI.<br /><br />Primary POC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alt POC<br />Name Marcus Abram&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Sandoval <br />Phone # (334) 953-5227&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(334) 953-6170<br />E-mail: marcus.abrams@maxwell.af.mil&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:anthony.sandoval@maxwell.af.mil">anthony.sandoval@maxwell.af.mil</a></p>

This contract will initially encompass all three aircraft weapon systems; however, the Air Force may decide to reduce or eliminate the requirement for contract repair on one or more weapon system at its discretion. An initial list of National Stock Number Items being considered for inclusion on a contract have been attached to aid in planning, however this list may be modified prior to solicitation. <br />Landing Gear Component Repair is a major depot-level repair program for the USAF.

<p>Minimum Mandatory Requirements</p>
<p>The Minimum Mandatory Requirements (MMR) reflects the government's minimum needs and are the lowest threshold acceptable. Failure to comply with the MMR will cause a proposal to be rejected.</p>
<p>--The contractor would be expected to ramp up for production in 180 days or less after contract award, with initial deliveries to begin 60 days or less thereafter.</p>
<p>--The government would expect to see a company capable of performing in the magnitude of 10,000 man-hours experience in the repair and overhaul of hydraulic components and 80,000 man-hours experience in the repair and overhaul of landing gear components within the last five years.</p>
<p>--Engineering and other key personnel shall be familiar with landing gear overhaul. They shall be able to communicate in English with Air Force personnel verbally and in writing.

<DESC>RFP-CMS-2011-0014<br /><br />A/B MAC Jurisdiction 5 Pre-solicitation Notice:
<p>***THIS NOTICE IS BEING REVISED ON 05/20/2011 TO CORRECT THE STATES WITHIN JURISDICTION 5 (J5) AS REFERENCED IN PARAGRAPH 5 BELOW.***<br /><br />As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS must re-compete its Part A &amp; B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain a A/B MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. The Contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of CMS.</p>
<p>The Contractor will perform numerous functions to support health care services for Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with providers of health care services, both institutional and professional, for a defined geographic area or "jurisdiction." The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, and CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare program. The Medicare program's legal, policy, and operating environment is complex, and the Contractor will utilize or interact with certain CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will coordinate its activities not only with the CMS, but also with a broad range of agencies (at the federal, state, and local levels of government), other CMS partners and Contractors, and a diverse range of stakeholders within the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from institutional and professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction and will perform standard or required editing on these claims to determine whether the claims are complete and should be paid. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor calculates Medicare payment amounts and remits these payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also will enroll new providers; conduct redeterminations on appeals of claims; operate a Provider Customer Service Program (PCSP) that educates providers about the Medicare program and responds to provider telephone and written inquiries; respond to complex inquiries from Beneficiary Contact Centers (BCCs); and make coverage decisions for new procedures and devices in local areas. The Contractor also will conduct a variety of different provider services, such as enrolling new providers in the program, answering written inquiries, and educating providers on Medicare's rules, regulations, and billing procedures.</p>
<p>CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Jurisdiction 5 (comprised of the states of&nbsp;Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska) on or about June 3, 2011. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is July 15, 2011 with an anticipated award date of March 1, 2012.</p>
<p>This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<DESC>
the procurement of information technology (IT) support services for the Naval Post Graduate School (NPS), Monterey CA, by Other Than Full and Open Competition from rSmart, Inc. These services are required to support mission distance education distribution and communication efforts to the Leader Development and Education for Sustained Peace (LDESP) faculty and students located throughout the world.   This support will include tier two and three support of the open source Sakai Collaboration and Learning Environment.

Sakai CLE is the enterprise solution for the delivery of online asynchronous learning content for NPS resident courses, NPS distance learning courses, and the learning content delivered on behalf of strategic partners by NPS, including the Foreign Area Officer Program, the Defense Language Institute, and the Naval Environment Training Command San Diego.
  

As an open source solution, Sakai does not have a traditional support mechanism for code QA, integration with other systems, bug fixes, patch management, and issue response.  Therefore, this support must be contracted to a third party specializing in supporting academic open source solutions.





4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996  Only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.	Demonstration of contractors unique qualifications:

(a)	Pursuant to FAR 13.501(a), an acquisition that specifies sole source or uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer shall be justified and approved in accordance with FAR 6.303 and 6.304.

(b)	rSmart was the contractor that was awarded the contract to install and configure both the NPS instance of Sakai and the FAO instance of Sakai hosted by NPS.
  They have a unique perspective and understanding on the way in which the site was configured, the systems that are integrated into both Sakai instances, the unique rules that govern our Sakai instances, the user roles contained within our Sakai instances, the security measures applied to both instances, and the business and academic rules that dictate how our Sakai instances can be used by NPS students and faculty.  Brining another contractor or service provider up to speed on these issues would take a significant amount of NPS staff time and would use up time of the overall contract.

(c)	 This is a logical follow on, NPS currently uses the rSmart version of Sakai which is different from the Sakai trunk release from the Sakai Foundation.
  Awarding the contract to another provider other than rSmart would result in NPS being forced to change versions of Sakai baci to the Sakai Foundation trunk.  This would result in two hardships.  First, the rSmart trunk undergoes more stringent security and QA testing.  Second, the change in versions would result in some downtime and may lead to unforeseen complications.

<DESC>ASC/PKESM, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH intends to award a one month with two week option sole source GSA Task Order to Riverside Research Institute under authority of FAR 8.405-6 and DFARS 208.405-70. The specific circumstance that justifies restriction for this acquisition is FAR 8.405-6(b) (2). The continued work is a logical follow-on to the original Federal Supply Schedule order and was competed and awarded in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not issued under sole source or limited source procedures. The contractor shall continue to provide Project Support Services for the office of research and sponsored programs at AFIT.
<p>The follow-on effort's source selection will not be completed by 31 May 11, the end date of the current period of performance. Therefore, the Government intends to award a new TASK Order to provide uninterrupted service while competitive source selected is completed. The base period of performance will be thirty days, with an option for two additional weeks.<br /><br />This notice is neither a request for a competitive proposal nor a solicitation for offerors. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement is based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.</p>
