<DESC>The Omaha District, US Army Corps of Engineers is seeking business members that qualify under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 238320 - Painting and Wall Covering Contractors.<br><br>On or around 13 June 2012, the Omaha district will advertise Phase 1 of a Two Phase Best Value Design-Build Request for Proposal project valued from approximately $7.5 to $10.0M. The Phase 1 solicitation will close on or about 27 June 2012.<br>In Phase 1 of the 2 phase design-build selection procedure, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as "offerors") submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria contained in the Phase 1 RFP and will short-list up to four (4) of the Phase 1 Offerors to compete for the design-build contract in Phase 2.  <br><br>An abbreviated Phase 1 proposal will only require the qualifications of the prime contractor and design entity.  This abbreviated schedule is necessary to make award by the end of the fiscal year.  Phase 1 Offerors will be asked to submit three (3) project examples that most clearly demonstrate construction experience on similar projects and three (3) project examples that most clearly demonstrate the prime design entity's experience on similar projects.  For each submitted project example, the Offeror should submit either a Construction Contract Administration Support System (CCASS) performance evaluation rating, a completed DD2626 (for construction) or DD2631 (for design) which are provided in this announcement, or another past performance data rating sheet that contains rating categories and materials similar to that shown on Form DD2626 (for construction) or Form DD2631 (for design).

Offerors in Phase 2 will have  30 days to submit a proposal for subcontractors, project management plan, utilization of small business, and price.<br><br>Project Description:<br><br>Work shall include the complete rehabilitation of steel tainter gates at Fort Randall Dam, South Dakota. There are 21 gates that measure 40 feet wide by 29 feet high. <br><br>Work shall include but not be limited to: visual Hydraulic Steel Structure (HSS) inspection of stoplogs and tainter gates, 3-D modeling and analysis utilizing STAAD.Pro software, non-destructive testing, structural repair design, welding (per AWS D1.5M/D1.5), corrosion repair, sandblasting, lead-based paint removal over/near water, wire rope replacement, concrete spall repair, gate seal replacement, concrete construction joint material replacement, cathodic protection removal and installation, and design and replacement of hoist controls and switches. This work may be subcontracted out to other specialty contractors, as required. <br><br>The Fort Randall project office has one set of spillway stoplogs (11 total measuring 3 feet-1 inches high by 42 feet-6 inches wide).

Taking gates off-site is prohibited. <br><br>Work may require grinding of new holes for drainage including a structural analysis for altering the gate. Experience in design/analysis of Hydraulic Steel Structures (HSS) is required. Inspection of the structural integrity of the structural members of the gates, including the skin, will be required. Analysis and design of structural repairs and/or replacement of structural members that have been damaged, or severely corroded, may be required. <br><br>The painting of the gate and associated features is considered the most critical aspect of this project. The painting subcontractor (or the Contractor if work is to be self performed) will be required to show successful completion of similar projects utilizing 5-E-Z vinyl painting system. The painting subcontractor (or the Contractor if work is to be self performed) shall have the following painting qualification: QP-1 Contractor Certification. Qualification requirements may be amended at a later date.<br><br>Coating contractor shall be required to hire an independent third party inspector that is NACE-CIP 3, PCS or SSPC-PCI 3 certified. <br><br>Work in confined spaces may be required. <br><br>Please note: Other contractors may be performing work simultaneously in the same general vicinity of the gate work. The Contractor shall cooperate and coordinate with other contractors and dam personnel as necessary in the interest of timely completion of all work. <br><br>Bidders - Offerors: <br>Please be advised of on-line registration requirement in Central Contractor Registration 'CCR' database https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/ and directed solicitation provisions concerning electronic annual On-line Representations and Certifications 'ORCA' at https://orca.bpn.gov/.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - Solicitations are not available at this time; however, a draft solicitation is attached to assist in the development of information in response to this RFI. REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.
<p>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office is seeking to exchange information with industry in order to improve the Industry's understanding of the Government requirements for professional and technical support services.

The intent of the RFI is to allow potential vendors to determine whether or how they can satisfy this requirement and to permit NOAA to obtain the highest quality of professional and technical services at a reasonable price while meeting the agency's established goals.</p>
<p>NOAA is seeking information, to structure an Agency-wide acquisition program for support services that are both technical and professional. The intent of the acquisition program is to reduce the overall costs of services, maintain or increase the level of small business participation and increase the overall quality of services acquired. The Agency challenges are some of the most significant facing our Nation. From daily weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring to fisheries management, coastal restoration and supporting marine commerce, NOAA's products and services support economic vitality and affect more than one-third of America's gross domestic product. NOAA is interested in excellence. The professional and technical service contracts are intended to help us obtain the service of only the best.</p>
<p>Potential offerors should provide comments and or recommendations to the following:</p>

With the exception of the Enterprise Operations domain, all are science related services. While all of the science related domains have common labor categories (i.e. Data Analyst, Researcher, etc.), each has expertise unique to their domain. Please identify the labor titles in your organization for each domain of interest as well as the "common categories" that may perform in all domains.</p>
<p>2. Do you consider the information contained within this solicitation an effective acquisition strategy for acquiring professional and technical services that traverse multiple departments such as those identified in the Section C - NOAA Statement of Work? If not, please elaborate on any different approach.</p>
<p>3. What would you consider an effective technical and price evaluation approach for establishing prime contractors under this program? Discuss any additions or recommended changes to the draft solicitation language.</p>
<p>4. Can your organization support on-site (your facility) and off-site (Government Facility) services simultaneously?</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The VA Nebraska Western Iowa Health Care System intends to negotiate a short term sole source contract with Rozene Development International, LLC, 2323 South 171st Street STE 202, Omaha, NE, 68130-4651, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.   Only one responsible source will meet the immediate needs for Seven Community Based Outreach Clinics (CBOC) and One Medical Center within the Nebraska Western - Iowa Health Care System.  The locations are: Bellevue CBOC (NE), Grand Island CBOC (NE), Holdrege CBOC (NE), Lincoln CBOC (NE), Norfolk CBOC (NE), North Platte CBOC (NE), Shenandoah (IA) CBOC, and the VA Med Center located in Omaha, NE.    

This is notice of intent to award a short term sole source under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Note - No award will be issued from responses to this notice. Response to this notice does not legally bind the government in any manner. Your concerns will be considered if you respond to this posting with a similar product/service.  

The justification for this sole source request is based on the Nebraska Western Iowa HCS maintaining their telework services currently being performed at eight locations in order to ensure that veteran patient needs are being met in preparation for both medical and surgical appointments and procedures.  Rozene Development International already has trained and credentialed employees that can fulfill this need on a short term basis until a long term contractual arrangement can be competitively solicited.        
  
All quotes received by 2:00 P.M. Central Time, October 3, 2012, will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by mail, or by facsimile at (402) 995-4508.

An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been ?substantially transformed? in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s). Note that any item that is a discreet article as it is sold in commerce, regardless of its ultimate function or use, cannot be considered ?substantially transformed? based solely on its integration into IT or other systems. <BR> <BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions. They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer.  All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government.

The proprietary software code is available only from the original software manufacturer(s) and authorized partner(s), and therefore precludes consideration of any other brand.  Thus, only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work.  The efficiency and security of software in use is dependent on the renewal of software licenses and maintenance to preserve the current DoS IT network and infrastructure. <BR> <BR>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers.

When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>

When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>

The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.    (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>

<AWARDEE>MUMPS AUDIOFAX INC;744 W. LANCASTER AVE., STE 250;WAYNE;PA;190872551
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR A LIMITED SOURCE AWARD UNDER A FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE   

1.	Contracting Activity:	 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
      Office of Acquisition Operations
 Technology Acquisition Center - Austin
 1701 Directors Boulevard, Suite 600
 Austin, Texas 78744

2.	Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a one-year firm-fixed price Task Order (TO) with a one-year option period, issued under General Service Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Contract Number GS-35F-0821M, to MUMPS AudioFax, Inc., doing business as Audiocare Systems (AudioFax), for renewal of 2,040 term software licenses, software and hardware maintenance, and optional hardware and software upgrades for the AudioCare System.  

3.	Description of the Supplies or Services:  The AudioCare System is operational at 148 VA Healthcare facilities within 22 Veterans Integrated Service Networks.  The system allows Veterans to supply and receive medical information from a Healthcare facility via a toll free number and internet sites.  Specifically, the AudioCare System, comprised of AudioCare software and hardware, performs the following functions:  prescription inquiry and refill order processing; prescription specific medication information for patients; prescription renewal requests and pick-up reminders; appointment scheduling and reminders; preventive health messages; customized patient surveys; secure physician/patient communications, such as for lab results, pre-examination questionnaires, immunization information, and screening reminders; staff emergency notifications, and; patient-initiated balance inquiries.  The TO will include term licenses, hardware and software maintenance, including help desk services and on-site support when necessary, and a one year option period for licenses and maintenance.  Finally, the TO will include optional line items for hardware and software upgrades so that the AudioCare System will be compatible with future Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) system changes.  Specifically, the upgrade will consist of replacing AudioCare hardware that has reached end of life, and upgrading AudioCare software to the Cache version 2010, which is required for mirroring the VistA system.  The upgrades are included as optional line items because each AudioCare hardware and software system will require upgrades at different times throughout the period of performance when the hardware has reached end of life or when the VistA system is upgraded to Cache version 2010.  

4.	Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting this action is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), Only one source is capable providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.

5.	Reason for Authority Cited:  AudioFax is the only known source capable of providing an automated communication system compatible with the existing VA infrastructure.  Specifically, the AudioCare System, provided by AudioFax, operates with VA's VistA system, a database written in Massachusetts Utility Multi-Programming System (MUMPS) language that holds VA patient scheduling and other information.  In order for Veterans to receive patient medical information, the automated communication system must be compatible with VistA and the MUMPS language.  AudioFax is the only known source that can provide automated communication software, hardware, and maintenance compatible with VistA.  AudioCare uses InterSystems Caché database software to interface with VA VistA database information.  Based on market research performed, no other commercially available solution provides an interface solution to the VA VistA database.  Finally, only the software and hardware provided by AudioFax can meet all of VA's functional requirements, which include a complete automated communications system consisting of pharmacy, scheduling, clinical, and financial functions required by VA.

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition:  The Government conducted market research, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  None of these efforts yielded additional sources capable of meeting all of the Government's requirements.  There is no competition anticipated for this action.  Furthermore, in accordance with FAR 5.3, VA will synopsize the contract award on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page.  In addition, VA will make this Justification and Approval publicly available on the FBO page.

7.	Actions to Increase Competition:  The Government is currently developing business requirements for a new automated communication system that would ultimately replace the current AudioCare System.  As a result, VA expects to conduct a full and open competition based on the new business requirements and implement a new automated communication system by October 2014.   
  
8.	Market Research:  The Government's technical experts conducted extensive market research from February to March 2012 to identify potential sources capable of providing an automated communication service with the ability to interface with VA's VistA database, including issuance of a Request for Information (RFI).  The technical experts conducted two types of web-based searches.  The first search was using key words of "MUMPS Software," "VA VistA," and a description of the aforementioned required products and services.  These searches produced a number of companies that provided either MUMPS training, database retrieving, or MUMPS programming.  The query did not produce any vendors who could provide an audio product for use in a MUMPS environment.  The second search was on automated communication systems in a healthcare environment.  The search did not produce a system that could meet all VA functional requirements.
 
VA technical experts also searched the FBO page to find past and current solicitations issued by other Federal Agencies for similar products and services.  The search demonstrated that no other system is available that can meet VA's needs.  The search revealed Tricare, the care program of the United States Department of Defense Military Health System, administers an enterprise contract with AudioFax for AudioCare products.

An RFI (VA118A-12-I-0071) was posted February 24, 2012 on the FBO page identifying VA automated communication system functional requirements to ascertain the ability of any other system that could meet VA's needs.  VA received one response from Siemens Enterprise Communications (Siemens), a large business.  Siemens submitted information regarding its Genesis system, a full suite of automated communication modules.  However, the system is not compatible with VistA, and VA would require a new interface in order for the Genesis system to obtain Veteran medical information from VistA and a new application to perform all of the required communication functions.  An interface would require development, customization, testing, deployment, and training, which could result in an interruption of services to Veterans receiving medical information from a Healthcare facility.  This would be detrimental to VA's mission.  The Government's technical experts contacted Siemens on May 29, 2012, and advised it of the Government's assessment that it could not meet VA's needs.  No objections were received.

Although there are other solutions being used in VA such as Streem-Cleo Communication and Xerox Patient Appointment Reminder Postcard, the Patient Appointment Reminders functionality is only one of five main modules required for this effort, and therefore does not meet all of VA's requirements. 

9.	Other Facts:  None

MILES equipment provides SF training duplicating high stress, real world operational environments such as, DoD required, Force on Force training. AFGSC units have been equipped with MILES and the new software will work in conjunctions with the simulated weapons that are designed to look, feel, function and have the same balance and safety features as the standard service weapons. The addition of this equipment at Camp Guernsey will enhance our capabilities to train in multiple environments utilizing multiple MILES systems combined from other units with seamless integration. The estimated cost for all the equipment will be $2.4M. <br />IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:<br />Acquisition for other than full and open competition is provided under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY):<br />The MILES specialized equipment currently in use was stocked at the DEPOT level and distributed through the supply channel. However, the new additional equipment for MILES is currently not stocked and the authority to purchase of supplies locally through local purchase was granted by the item manager. <br />Cubic has provided all MILES equipment throughout the command and therefore, Cubic is the only company that can provide 100% compatibility with the existing systems in the command. Cubic does not resell their MILES systems through any distribution channels, and there are no trained or licensed resellers or support organizations that are capable of integrating, supporting, and repairing the current MILES systems. This "Sole Source" request is needed to ensure the compatibility/continuity of product used within the existing MILES system. Purchasing this type of equipment from a different source will render the current MILES system incompatible and unusable. Therefore, there will be a substantial duplication of cost to the Government by purchasing a new system and there would be no expectation of recovering through competition. <br />MILES equipment is a system in itself that can track each participant establishing the time of hit and situation the participant was in. The unique capabilities of this system have not been produced or replicated to date. The MILES is highly specialized and only Cubic can provide the necessary compatibility. <br />VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITIED FROM AS MANY POTIENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE: <br />All of the MILES training equipment for AFGSC has been purchased form Cubic has throughout the command. The equipment was originally distributed through the Base Supply Channels and purchased through DEPOT. Therefore, Cubic is the only company that can provide 100% compatibility with the existing systems in the command. Cubic does not resell their MILES systems through any distribution channels, and there are no trained or licensed resellers or support organizations that are capable of integrating, supporting, and repairing the current MILES systems. There are new systems being built and tested but there is nothing out there at this point to satisfy this requirement. <br />Cubic has the only commercially available product that has been identified to have met and passed the specialized training. IAW 5.201(b), a notice of Intent to Award Sole Source was posted on 14 September 24, 2012, with required response time of 30 September, 2012. <br /><br />VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE: <br />The Contracting Officer has determined, by the signature on the cover page that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable based on the fact that the proposed cost received for material and labor are within industry standards for development of this product. Cubic Simulation Systems, Inc. holds a GSA contract, and GSA contract pricing is considered fair and reasonable based upon guidance provided in FAR 8.404(d). In addition, Cubic Simulation Systems will be granting the Government a 20% discount for the purchase of the additional equipment. <br />VIII. DESCRITPTIONOF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED: <br />Market research was conducted starting with the manufacture Cubic Simulation Systems, Inc. They only sell their equipment direct, and do not use a third party vendor to sell their product. This was verified by the manufacturer Cubic Simulation Systems, Inc., and through GSA Advantage Schedule in which only one source is listed. Furthermore the acquisition of the MILES system DoD wide is consistent in the limitation of sources IAW FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. This was verified by using EZQuery and FBO J&amp;A postings for sole source to Cubic Simulation Systems for the acquisition of the MILES system. Currently Cubic Simulation Systems (MILES) is being utilized at the 620th GCTS. The ability to create a seamlessly compatible system to current systems provides for a unique qualification the proposed contractor possesses which makes it the only company capable of meeting these minimum requirements without substantial duplication of costs. Duplication of cost would incur if the current system was replaced by a competing contractor with a like system. <br />Additionally, AFGSC/A7S conducted and consulted with several vendors, to include the manufacture. Vendors were searched using CCR/SAM NAICS code 333319 &amp; 423490 to locate a company that could provide exactly what was needed based on functionality and ability to meet increased realistic, relevant and robust force-on-force training for SF personnel and meet current compatibility requirements with existing systems. After extensive research, which included contacting companies queried in CCR/SAM with like NAICS code, EQQuery, FBO, and GSA Schedule, Cubic MILES has the only proprietary compatible system developed to meet current mission needs and requirements critical to the training of SF personnel securing nuclear and non-nuclear PL 1, PL 2, PL 3, and PL 4 assets. All items are on the Cubic GSA multiple award schedules and have been compared to other similar items found on other vendors schedules establishing reasonableness. <br />IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:<br />All information has been listed above and there is no additional supporting documentation. <br />X. LIST SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE AQUISION:<br />No submissions received expressing interest in the subject acquisition. <br />XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGANCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFOR MAKING SUBSEQUESNT ACQUITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED:<br />There are no cost effective methods to remove or overcome barriers to competition on these purchases and services at this time due to the reasons stated previously above. AFGSC/A7S will continue to monitor information and technical publications to determine whether any other sources can meet Government needs. Further, AFGSC SF will continue to foster relationships with approved Cubics, as well as users, to determine whether any other source can eventually meet government needs.<br />XII. Contracting Officer Certification:</p>
<p>The contracting officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>XIII. Technical and Requirements Certifications:</p>
<p>As evidenced by their signatures on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete.</p>

For Other than Full and Open Competition
Sole Source Award


1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs 
                                         	Veterans Health Administration
     	Strategic Acquisition Center
     	10300 Spotsylvania Avenue
Suite 400
Fredericksburg, VA 22408
   
2.  Description of Action:  This proposed sole source justification and approval is for the award of a firm fixed price (FFP) contract for the purchase of new furniture, delivery, installation, and dismantling of existing furniture to UNICOR (Federal Prison Industries FPI), 3301 Leestown Road, Lexington, KY 40511 for the Office of Resolution Management (ORM). UNICOR shall provide all labor, supervision, components, hardware, and parts necessary for proper assembly, disassembly, installation, tools, and operation, even though certain items may not be specifically described in the specifications. This includes all fittings, couplers, brackets, adapters, panel connectors, etc. Contractors shall include the cost of such components, hardware, and parts in the quotation price. The delivery of the new furniture shall not exceed 60 days after receipt of order.


3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  The purpose of this procurement is to purchase office furniture, lounge chairs, and system furniture for the Office of Resolution Management (ORM), 1575 I Street, Washington, D.C. The Contractor shall supply all materials, tools, labor, supervision, equipment and all necessary elements required to supply, disassemble, and install all deliverables. The price shall include complete design, delivery, set-up, travel and any other applicable costs. The estimated value of this requirement is $156,671.96.


4.  Authority:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 18 U.S.C. § 4124 Authorized or Required by Statute as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.302-5 (b) (1).The applicable statute is Public Law 108-447: "Division H of Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (Pub. L. 108-447).


5. Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  A review of UNICOR schedule items indicates that UNICOR offers items of comparable price, quality, time and delivery. UNICOR's pricing is competitive and at times often more cost effective than GSA vendors. UNICOR offers similar quality wood, laminate, fabric, and leather products as offered by vendors on GSA. UNICOR's delivery terms are 45 days from receipt of order. UNICOR offers a warranty of three years for the fabric/leather and all parts for ten years. UNICOR also offers comparable time requirements for design and installation as offered by GSA vendors.

A search in the electronic Contract Management System (eCMS) under UNICOR's supplier name indicated that there have been approximately twenty-eight (28) orders awarded for furniture by Veterans Affairs in the last two years.

In accordance with the priorities for use of Government supply sources in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 8.002, market research determined that these products and services are not available from (1) agency inventories, (2) excess from other agencies, but are available from (3) Federal Prisons Industries, Inc (8.002(a)(1)(iii).

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Additional market research was conducted through comparison of products offered by vendors on GSA Schedule. FAR 8.602 (a) (1) authorizes supplies and services from Federal Prison Industries (UNICOR), if the Contracting Officer has determined that Federal Prisons Industries products are comparable in terms of price, quality, time, and delivery to items available from private sector. Additionally, the proposed action will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities in accordance with FAR 5.301.

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  All future requirements will be handled on a case by case basis to determine any future acquisition strategy. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 18 U.S.C. § 4124 Authorized or Required by Statute as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.302-5.  The applicable statute is Public Law 108-447: "Division H of Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (Pub. L. 108-447). The statue encourages agencies to do purchase FPI supplies and services to the maximum extent practicable.


8.  Market Research:  Although extensive market research was conducted in support of VA798S-Q-12-0035, the basis for this sole source is the immediate need to satisfy mission requirements and purchase UNICOR products to the maximum extent practicable. In accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-5, a sole source award will be made to UNICOR, a Federal Government entity, for VA's furniture requirement. In accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-5(b)(1).


9.  Other Facts:  The Procuring Contracting Officer has determined that this acquisition meets all FAR requirements under 18 U.S.C. § 4124 Authorized or Required by Statute as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.302-5 (b) (1).The applicable statute is Public Law 108-447: "Division H of Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (Pub. L. 108-447).This acquisition is estimated at $156,671.96.
