<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to extend its current contract with LEADS Corporation, Arlington, VA on a sole source basis for information technology, X12 support for a period of one year. 

 The current contract effort is for research, analysis and technical support with respect to health care electronic data interchange and the application of American National Standards Institute accredited standards. The requirements associated with implementing the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) by CMS, are of a complex nature that requires continued high level technical assistance from contractor personnel.  The contractor will assist CMS in the development of electronic transactions and procedures for attaching electronic attachments to health care claims and other HIPPA related health care Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions.  Extensive understanding and experience with the ASC X12 and Health Level Seven Standards is also required.

Due to delays in publishing a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) for claims attachments, several of the tasks contained in the current contract have not  been completed. It is currently expected that these tasks will continue through FY 2003 and in order to complete the tasks, the current contract will be extended for a period of one year. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC
ADMINISTRATION, NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITE DATA AND INFORMATION SERVICE, OFFICE OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS INTENDS TO NEGOTIATE WITH EARTH AND SPACE RESEARCH, 1910 FAIRVIEW AVENUE EAST,  SEATTLE WASHINGTON, TO ESTABLISH AN OPERATIONAL DATA CENTER FOR TROPICAL PACIFIC SURFACE CURRENTS DERIVED FROM SATELLITE AND SCATTEROMETERS.

THE PURPOSE OF THE OVERALL PROGRAM IS TO DEVELOP A PROCESSING SYSTEM AND DATA CENTER TO PROVIDE OPERATIONAL OCEAN SURFACE VELOCITY FIELDS FROM SATELLITE ALTIMETER AND VECTOR WIND DATA. THE REGIONAL FOCUS WILL BE THE TROPICAL PACIFIC, WHERE THE VALUE OF THE DATA WILL BE DEMONSTRATED FOR A VARIETY OF USERS, SPECIFICALLY, FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND RECRUITMENT, MONITORING DEBRIS DRIFT, LARVAE DRIFT, OIL SPILLS, FRONTS AND EDDIES, AS WELL AS, ON-GOING LARGE SCALE EL NINO MONITORING, DIAGNOSTICS, AND PREDICTION. ADDITIONAL USES WILL BE ENCOURAGED IN AREAS OF SEARCH AND RESCUE AND MARITIME OPERATIONS.

IN 2001, THE NATIONAL OCEAN PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM (NOPP) ISSUED A BROAD AREA ANNOUNCEMENT, SOLICITING PROPOSALS TO DEVELOP OPERATIONAL OCEAN APPLICATIONS FROM SATELLITE ALTIMETER AND SCATTEROMETER DATA. EARTH AND SPACE RESEARCH ASSEMBLED A TEAM AND SUBMITTED A 3-YEAR PROPOSAL. THE LAGERLOEF METHOD OF DERIVING SURFACE CURRENTS WITH SATELLITE ALTIMETER AND SCATTEROMETER DATA IS THE OUTCOME OF SEVERAL YEARS OF NASA-SPONSORED RESEARCH.

THE CONTINUING WORK WILL BE TO TRANSITION THE LAGERLOEF METHOD TO OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS. THE END PRODUCT WILL BE VELOCITY MAPS UPDATED DAILY, WITH A 2-DAY DELAY FROM TIME OF SATELLITE MEASUREMENT. 

IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S PROGRESS ON THE DEMONSTRATION NOT BE LOST. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WORK CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT 24 MONTHS. DISRUPTION OF THE EXISTING WORK WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY DELAY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SURFACE CURRENT MAPPING CAPABILITY.

<SUBJECT>18 -- Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), Solar Radio Burst Locator (SRBL)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-75
<RESPDATE>082602
<ARCHDATE>09102002

<DESC>The System Program Office for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is projecting a future requirement for additional Solar Radio Burst Locator (SRBL). The incumbent contractor is Raytheon Technical Services Company.  SRBL supports the Solar Electro-Optical Network, which is comprised of the Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN) and the Solar Observing Optical Network. RSTN is comprised of the Radio Interference Measuring Set (RIMS) and the Solar Radio Spectrograph. SRBL replaces the RIMS component of RSTN. SRBL detects and locates radio flares on the solar disk by analyzing the microwave spectrum between 2 and 18 GHz. In addition, SRBL detects, but does not locate, flares between 1 and 2 GHz and at the discrete VHF and UHF frequencies of 245, 410, and 610 MHz. Data and information provided by SRBL are used to prepare alerts, warnings and forecasts of solar flares and associated phenomena. This planned effort provides the capability to: 1) Track the sun, acquire the radio and microwave spectra, record and analyze the data, and display the information to the system operator; 2) Measure and characterize the radio and microwave spectra of the flares; 3) Detect and locate solar flares during inclement-weather or cloud cover by analyzing the relative radio and microwave spectra; 4) Detect and verify a burst, interpret the modulated spectra to determine burst location relative to sun center and generate messages or plots that indicate time, intensity and location of the burst at frequencies at or above 2 GHz, which are greater than or equal to 500 solar flux units (SFUs); 5) Detect, but not locate, flares/bursts at frequencies below 2 GHz, which are greater than or equal to 50 SFUs; 6) Generate messages or plots that indicate time and intensity of bursts at frequencies below 2 GHz, and 7) Provide technical support during installation and system checkout, and during some nominal period after each SRBL becomes operational. It is projected that SRBL will be installed at three Air Force solar observatories, probably Holloman, NM, San Vito, IT and Learmonth, AU. The period of performance for this effort will include a 12-to-18 month production schedule and a 6-to-8-month installation schedule. SRBL will be produced under a build-to-redlined drawings agreement. The government will provide all redlined drawings, the Technical Requirements Document, equipment list, operational software and technical orders. Anyone having the interest, capability, or the ability to acquire the needed capabilities, to produce this effort should submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) which demonstrates the company's qualifications, experience and expertise in the following areas: 1) Solar and space physics; 2) Solar and space weather forecasting; 3) Electromagnetic signal processing of the radio and microwave spectra, including radio and microwave solar phenomena; 4) Digital electronics; 5) RFI; 6) Antenna and tracking system design; 7) Control systems; 8) Automated Data Processing Equipment; 9) Production, integration, installation and test; 10) Technical support (hardware and software), and 11) The ability to begin production immediately after contract is awarded.  A firm fixed price contract is anticipated for this effort.  The SOC must be received by 26 Aug 02 at the Space and Missile System Center/CIK, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467, El Segundo, CA  90245, Attn:  Ms Jo Ann Takayama, Contracting Officer at (310) 336-4143 or joann.takayama@losangeles.af.mil.  Also, provide a copy of SOC cover letter to SMC/BC, at the same address. This notice does not constitute and IFB or RFP.  The purpose of this synopsis is for planning purposes only.  If this synopsis results in a solicitation, all responsible offerors submitting a proposal will be evaluated.  Note: 26.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST - DESCRIPTION:

Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC (BBWI), P. O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID  83415-3521.  SUPPORT FOR RCRA CLOSURE - DEWATERING AND STABILIZATION OF TANK SOLIDS.  Contact Mr. Scott A. Drewes.  

I.  INTRODUCTION.  BBWI, a management and operating contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), is seeking an expression of interest from prospective vendors to provide support for RCRA Closure - Dewatering and Stabilization of Tank Solids.  This EOI shall serve as a method of screening potential vendors; allowing only qualified vendors to receive a formal Request for Proposal (RFP). 

II.  BACKGROUND.  A total of eleven vessels will be cleaned as part of a RCRA closure plan to be performed at the INEEL.  The vessels are located at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC), Building 603, approximately 50 miles from Idaho Falls, ID.  The waste material in the vessels consists of mixed suspended solids. The work will commence upon State of Idaho approval of the closure plan, which is expected in the summer of 2003. The vessels contain the following types and quantities of solids:

(a) 1,750 gallons of sand/anthracite mixture (0.2 - 2 mm)
(b) 700 gallons of Duolite C-464 ion exchange resin
(c) 900 gallons of Zeolon inorganic ion exchange media
(d) 6,000 gallons of suspended solids from filtration operations.

The solids are characteristically hazardous under RCRA (waste codes D006 and D007).  The solids are also radioactively contaminated with mixed fission and activation products.  The total activity concentration varies from 0.5 to 20 microcuries per gram, with the ion exchange media being the most heavily contaminated.  The radioactivity level of liquid remaining in the vessels is less than 0.2 microcuries per liter.  About 70,000 gallons of water are associated with the solids.  Treatment of the filtered water is outside the scope of work to be subcontracted.  It is estimated that vessel cleanout will be conducted over a 10- to 15-week period.  

III.  PROCESS SUPPORT NEEDS.  The INEEL will be responsible for removing solids and liquids from the vessels and delivering them to the Subcontractor's dewatering equipment.  Filtered water will be collected in INEEL tanks.  The INEEL will also provide a composite sampling device upstream of the Subcontractor's dewatering equipment. The Subcontractor must supply equipment, labor, and related services to perform the following:

(a) Collect and dewater solids from the slurry flow generated by the INEEL. Filtered water is to be pumped to INEEL-provided portable tanks.
(b) Provide chemical stabilization of the solids to render them non-hazardous. The high-integrity containers (HICs)/liners will be used for transportation and disposal of the stabilized waste, so stabilization must be performed in the containers.
(c) Provide sampling and analytical services for collected and stabilized solids.  An EPA-certified laboratory must be used.  For each HIC/liner, verification that the stabilized waste is not hazardous must be received with 90 days from the time that HIC/liner was filled with solids.
(d) Provide equipment, vehicles, and labor to transport stabilized waste containers to a disposal facility designated by the INEEL.

IV.  INFORMATION REQUESTED.  Vendors are requested to provide the following information:

(a) A description of systems, equipment, and analytical services that would be used.
(b) Space requirements for positioning and using on-site equipment (plan and elevation).
(c) Utility requirements for Subcontractor-provided systems and equipment.
(d) Requirements for connecting to Subcontractor-provided equipment (line types and sizes, types of connection, e.g., flanges, quick disconnects, etc.).
(e) Estimated flow rate for delivery of slurry to the Subcontractor's dewatering equipment.
(f) Unit costs/rates for dewatering and stabilization equipment.
(g) Labor requirements and rates.

It is the intent of this EOI to only solicit formal proposals (through the RFP process) to candidate vendors who successfully comply with the requirements of this EOI.  Please provide your EOI submittal to Scott A. Drewes, BBWI Procurement Agent, P. O. Box 1625, 1955 Fremont Avenue, Idaho Falls, ID  83415-3521, by close of business, Monday, August 12, 2002.  If you have questions or need additional information, please contact Mr. Drewes at (208) 526-1554 or e-mail SAD@inel.gov.  Technical questions must be submitted in writing via U.S. mail or e-mail.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/VSE-B), Kirtland AFB NM, is interested in receiving proposals (technical and cost) on research to advance and demonstrate the technologies required to enable an advanced missile Guidance, Navigation and Control system, and other closely related Ballistic Missile technologies. The total program budget for these efforts is approximately $53.2 million over five years. The government anticipates making up to four (4) contract awards but reserves the right to make more or less than four (4) awards based on the evaluation criteria specified. Funds are not presently available for this effort. Offerors are advised to contact the technical point of contact to verify interest in the effort to be proposed and funding availability PRIOR to committing resources to the preparation of proposals in response to this announcement. B. REQUIREMENTS. Proposals are desired for advanced Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) system designs and technologies that could lead to an integrated system for flight demonstration. The research area of interest is enabling GNC technologies for missile boost, post-boost, and terminal phases. Proposals for technologies which could enable future ballistic systems with enhanced GNC performance, reliability, maintainability, supportability, and affordability goals and which enhance performance and significantly reduce cost, schedule, or risk of existing technologies are of interest. Future GNC systems for advanced ballistic missile lift and reentry systems must perform to increasingly more demanding requirements for: 1) affordable, lower cost, 2) higher precision weapon deployment and targeting accuracy, 3) minimization of size and power, 4) immunity to space like hostile environments, 5) high mean time between failures and 6) robust units requiring minimal hands-on maintenance and environmental conditioning. The technologies needed to meet the anticipated strategic navigation, guidance and control requirements of the 2020 timeframe and beyond may be considered a revolutionary change from the current state-of-the-art fielded systems. These systems would satisfy the strategic requirements for the Air Force and Navy and also meet the size, weight, power and cost requirements of the precision strike initiatives. The technical challenge will be to develop the GNC technology to obtain the high precision sensors required for strategic applications, while keeping the cost, size, weight and power low enough to support nonstrategic applications. The envisioned performance goals are on the order of 0.01 degree/hr bias drift rate, with a scale factor error of 0.4 ppm for gyros, and a 1 micro-g bias stability with a scale factor error of 1 ppm for accelerometers with aiding by jam-resistant GPS technology. Work performed under any resulting contract may be classified up to the Secret Level. The DD 254 is attached hereto. The contractor(s) who is/are selected for an award under this PRDA may be required and then must be eligible to obtain a Secret facility clearance. Technical point of contact: AFRL/VSE-B, Dr. Sandra H. Slivinsky, 505-846-7222, fax 505-846-5589, email sandra.slivinsky@kirtland.af.mil. Open communication with the technical POC is encouraged until proposals are received. C. PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS: Proposals shall be due 45 days from the date of this announcement.

Since the US and the Canadian provinces figure heavily into the solution to the conundrum, FHWA needs similar support from the National Governor?s Association.  The unique position of  the NGA as the association of Governors for all the states, their experience in the issues associated with state based activities, and their specific experience in IRP and IFTA matters make them the only known source with a combination of skills and abilities to provide this service.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is on or about August 8, 2002.

<DESC>The U.S. District Court of Arizona (USDC-AZ) requires a digital audio recording system that will digitally record four channels of courtroom audio for the court record.  The captured audio will be searched for, played back, copied, archived, transcribed and/or distributed.

For courtrooms where audio recording is currently in use, the District of Arizona currently uses a mixture of Sony and Lanier analog recorders.  These analog systems provide four-channel audio recording to cassette tapes.  VIS/TA software, integrated with the recorders,  is used for logging.  These systems reside in thirteen courtrooms, and portable systems are used for the Prescott courthouse, chambers, and wherever court is held in a temporary location. 

A total of 18 digital audio systems (13 permanent and 5 portable) are required for 5 courthouses.  Some of the systems will store the digital audio on a network server and some will write data to CDs, and all electronic court recorder operators (ECROs) in the district must be able to access any  courtroom recording throughout the district. One of the Tucson systems and one of the Phoenix systems must be set up to be "turnkey"-like in their ease of initiating and playing back a reliable recording.

Award will be made to the vendor whose proposal offers the best value to the district.  Evaluation factors, in priority order, are: 1. Functionality of the digital audio recording capabilities as called out in the requirement specifications; 2. Price; 3. Ability to integrate with the District's VIS/TA software; 4. Ease of initiating (fewest number of steps necessary to initiate) a recording session and playing back audio during court.

To request a copy of the RFP, send an email request to carol_agne@azd.uscourts.gov, send a fax to Carol Agne at (602) 322-7179, or send a letter to Carol J. Agne, Systems Project Manager, U.S. District Court of Arizona, Sandra Day O'Connor U.S. Courthouse, 401 W. Washington Street, Suite 150, SPC 6, Phoenix, Arizona 85003-2119.  Requests will be honored if received by August 7th, 2002.  Requesters must include their email address as the RFPs will be sent out via electronic mail on or about August 7th, 2002.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Habitat Conservation Division, St. Petersburg, FL, intends to procure a study on the assessment of the ichthyoplankton community and water current dynamics at the known reef fish spawning sites in Puerto Rico: LaParguera and Cabo Rojo to be conducted by the University of Puerto Rico.  The purpose of this project is to determine the most important spawning areas for economically and ecologically important reef fish, such as the yellow tail snapper, using studies of current flow to track nutrient availability within the reef ecosystem, monitoring and characterization of reefs.  Based on previous studies integrating current mapping and nutrient availability within some of Puerto Rico's reef systems, it has been found that currents can be used to map nutrient flow and therefore, determine abundance of reef fish larvae.  The objective would be to determine, in areas around the island where reefs are abundant such as La Parguera, Culebra, Vieques, Fajardo, Jobos, Guanica, Guayanilla, Desecheo and Mona, which are most important on the basis of abundance and diversity of reef fish larva and use these data to establish spawning habitat protection zones on the basis of accessibility/feasibility as well as science.  The University of Puerto Rico' Marine Sciences Department has the technical capability, facilities, and space available for this project.  More importantly, the Marine Sciences Department has the equipment necessary to perform the current studies, water column physical profiles, and ichtyoplankton collection.  The Department also has the only marine research vessel available in Puerto Rico.  The intended procurement is for research for which the Government intends to acquire from one source, The University of Puerto Rico, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time.  The Government reserves the right to solicit proposals based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue a purchase order to The University of Puerto Rico,  whichever is determined to be most advantageous to the Government, without further notice.  All interested parties must submit in writing the following:   name; address; point of contact; telephone number; business size and a brief statement regarding it's capability to provide the specified research and the names; telephone numbers; and points of contact for businesses or other Government agencies to which it has previously provided similar research.   No response will be provided to those inquiries which fail to provide the information requested.  This information should be faxed to 816-426-7530, Attn: Sharon Clisso.  A determination by the Government not to compete this  requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The NAICS code is 541710.  The small business standard is 500 employees.  This is not a small-business set-aside.  The research will be purchased under the guidelines of FAR, Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires an all solid-state laser source at 532 nm that is suitable for nonlinear sum-frequency-mixing (SFM).  The single-frequency output radiation at 532 nm will be doubled to 266 nm in an external power-enhanced cavity using the nonlinear crystal BBO.  The single-frequency radiation at 266 nm will be summed with light at 717 nm to generate narrowband, single-frequency, broadly tunable radiation at 194 nm.  The 194 nm radiation will be used to laser-cool electro-magnetically stored mercury ions.  The output power level at 532 nm must be 10 W or greater.  The laser must operate in both a single transverse mode and a single longitudinal mode.  The laser must be
single frequency with a linewidth less than 5 MHz.  The mode must be Gaussian (M squared less than or equal to 1. 1).  The power stability is to be no worse than plus or minus 1% after a 30 minute warm-up, and the amplitude noise must be less than 0.05% from 10 Hz - 1 GHz.  The output polarization is to be linear (greater than 100:1).  The beam waist should be on the order of 1 mm.  Required delivery time is less than 12 weeks ARO.

<DESC>The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), National Water and Climate Center (NWCC), located in Portland, OR, operates two unique hydroclimatic data collection systems.  One of the systems known as the Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) provides near real-time precipitation, air pemperature and snowpack information to forecast stream flow volumes.  The NWCC is seeking sources for pressure transducers to be used for it SNOWTEL system.  Prospective Bidders will be required to sale two transducers of each sizes, a total of 10 units to be used as test examples to NWCC in order to qualify as a possible vendor.  The tests would include 1) cold testing to the specified temperture, and all other specifications as outlined in our specification sheeet, 2) prospective bidders are to provide the testing units within  8 weeks of placing an order , 3) one week to test units, then, placed on self for 3 weeks to test for short term drift.  If all units submitted by a vendor pass this 4 weeks testing, then the units will be conditionally qualified and the NWCC would purchase a limited amount of units to be placed in the field.  After 6 months of in-th-field testing, the vendors would be fully qualified and the NWCC would begin purchasing the units at a rate of approximately 100 per year.  It is anticipated that an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract will be issued to the successful vendor.  The specifications for the pressure transducer are included to this posting.  Vendors are required to submit their transducers and specifications to our testing center in Portland, OR, to the attention of Ronald Bush, technical contact (see attachment for instructions and specifications).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercially available socks capable of being used as a Cold Weather/Mountaineering Sock, prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Proposals are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation number is M67854-02-R-3122 and is issued as a combined synopsis and solicitation in accordance with FAR 12.6 for commercial items as defined in FAR Part 2.1.  This is an unrestricted full and open competition.  The NAICS code is 315119 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  Offerors shall provide proposals for: Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 0001 - 80,000 pair of Cold Weather/Mountaineering Socks, sized to fit 5% Female to 95% Male Marines. 

Requirements for the socks are: must be as warm or warmer than the existing cold weather sock (NSN 8440-00-153-671) both when wet and when dry; weight not to exceed .16Kg/pair for size large, when dry; have shock absorption, quick drying, and moisture wicking transmission properties; and possess integrated friction reducing technology.  Additional properties are: sized to fit 5% Female to 95% Male Marines; shrinkage or elongation in foot length and width not to exceed 6.0% when laundered 6 times in accordance with the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC), test method 135; color subdued.  In addition each sock shall have a label marked with the size, fiber content and laundering instructions.  It is desired that the socks also be flame retardant.  The objective is to acquire commercial off-the-shelf socks suitable for use on all terrains, in temperature conditions ranging from 30o to -25o F, and compatible for use with existing cold weather boots (ICB, ICWB, and black and white VB boots).  Delivery dates for socks are to be determined, but an initial delivery is required within 30 days after award of contract and the total quantity must be delivered within 12 months of contract award.  (Offerors shall propose delivery schedules based on production capacity or product availability).  Delivery shall be FOB Destination.

The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, and FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items apply to this acquisition. The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of the provision are Conformance with requirements, Delivery Schedule, Past Performance, and Price.  Conformance with requirements is more important than Price, which is more important than the combination of Delivery Schedule and Past Performance.  However, the importance of price as a factor in the award determinations will increase with the degree of equality in the overall technical merit of the proposals.  Delivery Schedule and Past Performance are of equal importance.  Award will be made on a Best Value basis.  Conformance with requirements will be evaluated for the proposed items? capability to meet the technical performance requirements stated herein.   In evaluating the conformance with requirements of the proposed items, the following elements will be considered as demonstrated by the written proposal, product literature and through lab testing of product demonstration samples:
            
a.	Product performance as demonstrated through supporting test data (and test methods) or other empirical evidence provided for the proposed product offering.
b.	Shrinkage or elongation in foot length and width  (not to exceed 6.0% when laundered 6 times in accordance with American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC), test method 135).
c.	Clo value measured on a copper foot under dry and wet conditions.
d.	Weight (not to exceed .16Kg/pair for size large, when dry).
e.	Quick-drying ability (air dries in 6 hours or less).
f.	Sizing information/chart.
g.	Marking (permanent, for size, fiber and laundering instructions).

The offeror?s proposed delivery schedule will be evaluated to ensure initial delivery is provided within 30 days of contract award, and the schedule clearly indicates the timeframe for delivery of remaining quantities to be completed within 12 months of contract award.  

The offeror?s past performance with Government and Industry in providing items similar to those required by the solicitation will be evaluated to assess the relative risks and likelihood of success in meeting the requirements in this solicitation.  At a minimum, offerors shall ensure that Past Performance citations provide relevant examples, accomplished within the past three (3) years. The following elements will be considered during the past performance evaluation, and references provided will be contacted to substantiate performance:

a.	Delivery Schedule Compliance
b.	Quality of Products and Services
c.	Overall Customer Satisfaction with Products and Services
d.	Depth of Support Base
e.	Management of Technical and Business Aspects of the Company

Price will be evaluated for reasonableness.  The evaluated price shall be calculated for CLIN 0001 by multiplying the unit price by the total quantity.

The Government will award one contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

An original and four (4) copies of the proposal are required. Offerors shall submit no more than one proposal in response to this solicitation.  Six (6) pair of product demonstration sample socks shall be submitted with the offer.
