<DESC>THIS IS A REISSUANCE OF PRESOLICITATION NOTICE 674-03-007.  
IT IS BEING REISSUED AS NO RESPONSIVE BIDDERS WERE RECEIVED.
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement USAID/South Africa’s (USAID/SA) new Integrated Education Program (IEP) which is targeted to improve access to quality education for South Africa’s historically disadvantaged population.  The IEP will be implemented in the four target provinces:  Eastern Cape (EC), Northern Cape (NC), KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and Limpopo (LP). The Mission has developed parameters for a new primary education-focused activity that integrates and creates synergies with ongoing training and higher education activities, the IEP. The new IEP will build on the lessons learned and best practices developed over the course of the program, namely, (i) use of a holistic approach to school development, especially governance which must involve communities; (ii) emphasis on leadership development at both school and district levels; and (iii) provision of support to clusters of schools, rather than individual schools. Under the anticipated contract, the contractor will be expected to contribute to the achievement of the following key objectives in order to assist USAID/South Africa to attain the result of improved quality of primary education, with a specific focus on improving the system’s capacity to deliver quality math and science programs. Those objectives are: (i) enhanced capacity of teachers (targeted to the teaching of literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science; (ii) effective implementation of Curriculum 2005 (C2005), with a focus on literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science curriculum; and (iii) improved educational management and enhanced school governance. The stated objectives are consistent with the National Department of Education (NDoE) and those of other local and international development partners. USAID/South Africa anticipates awarding one performance based contract for a three year period using full and open competition. The government estimate is $23m with an additional $5.6 pending.  The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Government-wide point of entry (GPE).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solication.  The General Services Administration intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a sole source, Firm-Fixed Price contract, under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to Advanced Programming Concepts, Incorporated located in Austin, Texas.  The procurement is to upgrade the existing Multi-Radar Tracking System (MRTS) at Naval Strike Air Warfare Center (NSAWC) Fallon, NV.  Advanced Programming Concepts was determined to specifically address the unique requirements being utilized by Naval Strike Air Warfare Center.  This effort will upgrade the existing Version 11 multi-radar tracking system (MRTS) to Version 12 at the Naval Strike Air Warfare Center (NSAWC) Fallon, NV.  The Version 12 will mainly provide Fallon with Link 16 capability.  Advanced Programming Concepts (APC) is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the MRTS. NSWC Corona Division and NSAWC Fallon originally acquired this item through competitive procurement.  The original "off-the-shelf" system was not procured with specifications, software, or electronic drawings due to Advanced Programming Concept’s proprietary rights.  The installation of a unit from another manufacturer will force NSAWC Fallon to acquire a radar display from another manufacturer, retrain personnel on the operation, maintenance, and repair of the new system at considerable cost, Advanced Programming Concepts is the only source for this requirement and is solely capable of responding to ongoing support requirements. The multi-radar tracking system specifications are attached to this synopsis for industry information.  The proposed action is for supplies/services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the supplies/services that will satisfy the agency requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The applicable North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541511 and the size standard is $21.0 million.  All interested parties must submit a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications, capabilities, and previous experience related to fulfilling a similar requirement via e-mail to diemle.phan@gsa.gov by 4:00 p.m., PST, March 26, 2004. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

(a)	The offeror or bidder shall indicate in paragraph (e) below the name and address of the laboratory or laboratories where components or end items will be tested during the course of any resultant contract. A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSC&#64979;POL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.

(b)	Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and  send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c)	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory (DPSC&#64979;POL #215&#64979;'737&#64979;7052) in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.

(d)	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

(e) 	Any change in the laboratory (laboratories) specified below is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                                                     ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                                                           ].
	NAME AND ADDRESS COMPONENT SOURCE: [                                              ].

* When a single lot of material requires testing by more than one laboratory for difference characteristics, list the name of the secondary laboratory and test characteristics below:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                                                     ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                                                           ].
	TEST CHARACTERISTICS: [                                                                         ].

(f) 	It is solely the prime contractor's responsibility to shcedule QL testing and to obtain test reports. The cost of QL testing shall also be borne by the prime contractor.

(g) 	Shipment of component materials to the prime contractor need not be defereed pending test results except when shade approval is required (see paragraph (h)). Cutting production lots without a passing QL test report on the corresponding samples is done at the contractor's own risk.

(h) 	Shade evaluation is acceptance testing. Therefore, component lots may not be shipped to the prime contractor until the DPSC Laboratory accepts the shade of the material.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has a requirement for modeling and simulation (M&S) services encompassing an array of technical and analytical support for its Integrated Deepwater System (IDS) program.  Over the past five years myriad technical, analytical, and integration tasks have been performed through an existing Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with MicroSystems Integration, Inc (MSI).  These tasks included M&S, decision support, cost analysis, operations research/operations analysis, requirements management, and technical consulting.  Services over the next 5 years will continue these technical and analytical M&S support services.  The objectives of the proposed effort are to continue development, use and maintenance of the IDS M&S framework, the M&S environment, the M&S system, resultant M&S models and associated analysis and reports related to the framework, environment, system or resultant simulation models runs.  Key to this effort is conducting campaign-level multi-mission M&S to evaluate performance of the IDS.  The M&S involves a full-range of USCG missions and multiple types of threats in various regional scenarios.  The contractor will update and maintain the Coast Guard’s Deepwater Maritime Operation Effectiveness Simulation (DMOES), the Maritime Operation Simulation (MarOpsSim), the Deepwater Operation Effectiveness Modeling Environment (DOEME), the system architecture and associated documentation.  USCG intends to issue a sole source contract to MSI for these services as a follow-on effort.  This is not a request for proposals.  No solicitation is available, nor will one be issued.  Parties that believe they can fulfill this requirement should submit qualifications packages prior to the closing date.  Packages must contain a full description of the party’s capability to fulfill USCG requirements in sufficient detail to determine whether the firm is acceptable.  Marketing information and high level corporate capability statements are not desired and will not be accepted.  In the event no additional capable firms are identified through this synopsis, the Coast Guard will award a sole source contract. See numbered note 22.  Closing date for submission is 04/20/04.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement and intends to award a contract for the collection, format and dissemination of automated aircraft upper air weather observation data via the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS).  This data will be used in aviation models to produce more timely and accurate aviation weather analysis and forecast. The FAA also anticipates this requirement will include a task for the collection, and dissemination of the automated aircraft performance data providing funds are available at time of award. A contract performance period of 1 base year with 4 (12 months each) options is planned. The estimated contract value is $600K per year for a total of $3,000,000.00. The purpose of this announcement is to survey the market for available sources with the capabilities, resources and qualifications to provide the operational services required. Vendors interested in submitting a capability statement for this requirement must address all of the following: 1.	Demonstrate knowledge of Air-Ground and Ground-Ground communications paths and ground-ground protocols with participating Meteorological Data Collection and Reporting Service (MDCRS) Airlines. 2.	Ability to provide Datalink service to MDCRS participating airlines. 3.	Ability to communicate VHF D/L Service at over 200 domestic airport locations. 4.	Ability to receive Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) /MDCRS messages from any aircraft, anywhere in the CONUS. 5.	Ability to provide 24 x 7 network and service monitoring capability with the ability to respond any time a D/L outage occurs. 6.	Need to have CONUS field support network in place if remote maintenance is needed. 7.	Ability to receive (ACARS) messages which include MDCRS information from participating airlines by way of High Frequency, Very High Frequency or Satellite communications system. 8.	Ability to process the messages in such a way as to "strip off" the MDCRS data, reformat to BUFR format, and pass the message to the FAA and NWS by way of the FAA's NADIN II network. 9.	Ability to provide VHF datalink service agreements with service commitments that state that the service provider's VHF ACARS service is used as primary over any other provider in North America for airlines participating in the MDCRS program. If you are interested in being considered for this requirement, provide a written qualification statement (not to exceed 5 pages) (two copies) documenting each of the requirements listed above, including references.  The qualification statements will be evaluated to determine if the vendor is able to provide the level of expertise needed to fulfill this requirement.  The FAA reserves the right to award a contract based on the results of this survey.  If this survey results in a competitive acquisition, the competition will be limited to those vendors who responded to this survey and were evaluated and determined to be qualified for all factors.

The purpose of this procurement is to obtain data on nutritional factors and lifestyle from the first 1,100 subjects recruited of a 50,000 person cohort.  This data will be compared with data obtained from  previous order (263-MQ-312730) where the data was obtained from 1000 random Golestan adults.  This data will aid the CPSB in the planning and execution of a case-control study in Golestan Province as well as providing an independent assessment of risk factors for esophageal cancer.  Esophageal cancer is one of the leading causes of death from malignant neoplasms in many countries around the world.  The CPSB conducts intramural research in the areas of, genetics and cancer, nutrition and cancer, cancer chemoprevention, and other cancer prevention strategies aimed at lowering human cancer risk.  IARC had worked in Golestan province in the 1970s and restarted there work approximately 2 years ago.  They are in the advanced planning stages for developing a cohort of approximately 50,000 subjects and have already selected, questioned, and obtained biological samples from some of the group.  This existing data can be used by the CPSB in the planning of its own studies, including a Case-control study in Golestan Province, which is currently being designed by the CPSB.   IARC is the only source known to the NCI researcher that can provide this data.   This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.   However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on April 5, 2004.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This announcement serves to cancel the original announcement, posted on March 10, 2004.  This is converted to a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   Solicitation AB133F-04-RP-0044 is being issued as a Request for Proposals.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 20, dated 2/23/2004.   This procurement action is not restricted; full and open competition is sought.  A firm is a small business for the purpose of this requirement if its size standard is $6 million gross per year or less.    Three charters are solicited.   They are identified as Charter Vessel #1, Charter Vessel #2, and Charter Vessel #3.   The government intends to award contracts for two or three vessels.   One vessel may perform Charter Vessel #1 and Charter Vessel #3, or Charter Vessel #2 and Charter Vessel #3 if it meets all the technical requirements for both charters.   Charter Vessel #1 and Charter Vessel #2 must be performed by different vessels due to overlap in performance periods.  Offer must clearly identify which charter or charters they wish to be considered for.  Options for performance in 2005 and 2006  for the same work during the same time frame are included in this solicitation.  Offers are required to offer on options for 2004 and 2005 to be considered for contract award.   Following are the special provision requirements for each of the three vessel charters:  
SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR VESSEL CHARTER #1

	The government will negotiate a charter of a vessel to conduct biological studies of Steller sea lions in the Aleutian Islands and Gulf of Alaska.  The primary objectives of this research are resighting branded and tagged sea lions and collecting biological samples at as many as 50 rookeries and haul-out sites.  The base period of the charter will be for 13 days with 6 optional days, starting on or about 10 May 2004 at Dutch Harbor, Alaska, and ending on or about 26 May 2004 at Kodiak, Alaska.  Accommodations for a scientific party of up to 4 biologists will be required.

VESSEL AND CREW SPECIFICATIONS

Vessel and crew requirements under this charter shall be as follows:

1.  Minimum overall length of 85 feet (26 m), maximum draft of 14 feet (4.3 m), and height to bridge deck of 14' (4.3 m) from waterline.

2.  Minimum cruising speed 9 knots (17 km/hr).

3.  Minimum vessel operating endurance of 14 days (based on a average running time of 12 hours per day at 9 kts or 17 km/hr).

4.  Vessel shall be equipped with appropriate modern electronic navigational and communication equipment, including but not limited to:  two all-weather radars (36 mile or 67 km minimum range), VHF radio (one or more fixed installation), synthesized 1-18 MHz SSB radio, and redundant GPS navigational equipment.  All communication equipment shall be tested and tuned before the charter begins.  The vessel must be equipped with appropriate charts for operating in all areas of the predicted charter work including coastal waters of the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands, to the extent practicable, and the Sandman Reef area west of the Shumagin Islands.

5.  The vessel shall also have the following:
a. Bridge or wheelhouse protected from the weather. 
b. Minimum of 50 sq. ft. (4.6 sq. m) of additional interior space with table/benches
and 110/220 AC electrical service, which can be dedicated to use as a dry laboratory.
c.  A clean, uncovered flush deck area of a least 500 sq. ft. (46.5 sq. m) for storage
and launching of two 16-foot (4.9 m) inflatable boats.  On deck work area(s) should be relatively clear of running gear, equipment, and stowage.
d.  Dry storage areas, readily accessible, of approximately 500 cubic feet 
		(14 cubic m) for excess scientific supplies and equipment.
	e.  At least 10 cubic feet (0.3 cubic m) of freezer space for specimens.
f.  Capability for loading and off-loading the scientific party and a 16-foot (4.9 m)
		inflatable boat with outboard motor to and from the water (inflatable boat supplied by Government).  Loading and off-loading of the inflatable boat shall be with a crane extendable to 10' (3 m) past the side of the vessel and capable of lifting up to 2 tons.
g.  Seawater and deck hose for cleaning.
h.  Potable fresh water supply adequate for vessel and personal use of up to 10
		people for 21 days.  If a water maker is not available then a minimum of 4,000 gallons (15,000 liter) is required.

6.  Minimum crew of vessel shall consist of Captain, engineer-mate, cook, and deck hand.  The Captain shall have a minimum of five years experience as a master of a vessel comparable in size to the vessel selected; preference will be given to Captains with experience operating in coastal (rather than offshore) waters adjoining the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands, and with commercial fishing and/or marine mammal experience.  The engineer-mate must be qualified for independently taking over operations of the vessel in the event the captain is absent or becomes incapacitated.  The cook will be experienced in preparing meals for 10 or more people.

7.  Accommodations must be provided for a scientific party of up to 4 which may include male and female scientists, as well as foreign nationals.

OPERATING PROCEDURES
1.  The scientific party will be U.S. government employees or cooperators.  The purpose of the cruise will be resighting branded and tagged sea lions and collecting biological samples at as many as 50 rookeries and haul-out sites in the Gulf of Alaska.  The scientific party will board the vessel at Kodiak, Alaska, departing on or about 12 May, and working within a 200 nm (370 km) radius of Kodiak.  This includes sites between Chowiet Island (approximately 56ƒµ00'N, 156ƒµ41'W) to the west and Outer Island (59ƒµ21'N, 150ƒµ24'W) to the east.  The cruise will end in Kodiak on or about 30 May 2003.  The exact sequence in which individual sites will be visited may change in response to weather and sea conditions.  Items Numbered 2, 3, 4, and 5 under Operating Procedures for Vessel Charter #1 also apply to Vessel Charter #2.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR VESSEL CHARTER #3

The government will negotiate a charter of a vessel to conduct biological studies of Steller sea lions in the eastern Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound.  The primary objective of this research is to collect post-mortem biological samples from sea lions at the Seal Rocks and Wooded (Fish) Island rookeries.  These two rookeries frequently have greater than average early pup mortalities.  A secondary objective is to resight branded and tagged sea lions and collect biological samples at as many as 30 rookeries and haul-out sites.  The base period of the charter will be for 7 days with 6 option days, commencing as early as 25 May but ending by 15 June 2004.  Precise timing of cruise dates may depend upon timing of pup births and mortalities as indicated by observations obtained from a remotely-operated camera system.  Accommodations for a scientific party of up to 4 biologists will be required.

VESSEL AND CREW SPECIFICATIONS

All Vessel and Crew Specifications for Vessel Charter #3 are the same as those for Vessel Charter #1, EXCEPT: Vessel overall minimum length requirement is 58 feet (18 m);   Minimum vessel operating endurance is 10 days;  there is an additional requirement of the vessel to have covered deck space that can be utilized for onboard necropsies and tissue processing of dead sea lions collected from rookeries and haulouts;  the minimum crew of vessel shall consist of three persons to handle the duties of Captain, mate, engineer, cook, and deck hand; and preference will be given to Captains with experience operating in coastal waters adjoining the northern Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound.

OPERATING PROCEDURES

1.	The scientific party will be U.S. government employees or cooperators.  The primary purpose of the cruise will be to collect post-mortem biological samples from sea lions (primarily pups) from the Seal Rock (south of Hinchinbrook Entrance) and Wooded (Fish) Island (southeast Montague Island) rookeries.  Secondarily, resights of branded and tagged sea lions and collection of biological samples at as many as 30 rookeries and haul-out sites in the eastern Gulf of Alaska and Prince William Sound may be conducted.  The scientific party can board the vessel at Seward, Whittier, Valdez, or Cordova, Alaska.  The potential range of survey sites are between Outer Island (59ƒµ21'N, 150ƒµ24'W) to the west and Cape St. Elias (59ƒµ47.5'N, 144ƒµ36'W) to the east.  The cruise will end at the harbor of debarkation by 15 June 2004.  The exact sequence in which individual sites will be visited may change in response to weather and sea conditions.

2.	The vessel will transport scientists to Steller sea lion rookeries and haul-out sites, disembark the scientists, and await their return from the site.  The vessel must wait nearby and maintain VHF radio communication with the scientific party.  At some locations, scientists will collect dead sea lions to conduct necropsies (post-mortem exams) and collect tissue samples.  Sea lion pups will be collected from beaches and necropsies will likely be conducted on board the vessel.  Except for these instances, once the scientists are aboard the vessel will depart for the next site.  .  Items Numbered 3, 4, and 5 under Operating Procedures for Vessel Charter #1 also apply to Vessel Charter #3.

<DESC>Notice of Upcoming Standard Competition for Department of Labor Printing and Reprographics study in accordance with FAR 14.503-1 Two-Step Sealed Bidding Procedures under OMB Circular A-76.
There will be a Request for Technical Proposals (RFTP) during the month of May 2004 using FAR Part 14. This request covers the basic mechanics and process by which the Department of Labor has chosen to pursue the “Public vs. Private” competitive sourcing competition under OMB Circular A-76 and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). The description of services required shall cover the complete operation and maintenance of Printing and Reproduction services at DOL headquarters, 200 Constitution Avenue, Washington, D.C., using the Two-step Sealed Bidding method.  A rough draft outline of the service outputs required will be available in handout to those attending the site visit scheduled tentatively for 21 May 2004 from 10-11 a.m., Friday. 

Step 1 of the 2 step process requires submission of formal technical proposals only during Step 1 that comply with all aspects of the RFP, especially Section L requirements which will be evaluated in accordance with Section M.  Evaluation criteria will be initially provided to all potential offerors during posting of the Draft RFP and will include all relevant factors and any significant sub-factors. Submission of technical proposals in Step 1 shall not include prices or pricing information.  Doing so will make proposals unacceptable on their face.

The initial RFP is planned for release during the week of 28 June 2004, and at this time, the date by which the proposals must be received is estimated to be approximately 28 July 2004. In the Step 2, second step, only bids based upon technical proposals determined to be acceptable in Step 1, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for possible award, and this includes the Government’s Bid (MEO Price) as this is a Standard Cost Competition under OMB Circular A76 dated 29 May 2003.  Each bid received in the second step must be based on the bidder's own technical proposal. The Government’s Bid will be based on the Circular A76 cost procedures, Attachment C, and will reflect the cost of performing the Government MEO operation in compliance with the A76 Circular. All offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or any additional information, and this includes the Government’s proposal.  The Government Contracting Officer may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability of the proposals solely on the basis of the proposal as submitted; and may proceed with the second step without requesting further information from any offeror in Step 1; however, the Government may also request additional information from offerors of proposals in Step 1 that it considers reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable, and may discuss proposals with those offerors. For proposals determined to be unacceptable, a notice of unacceptability will be forwarded to the offeror upon completion of the proposal evaluation period and final determination of unacceptability. Only one technical proposal may be submitted by each offeror in Step 1. Multiple technical proposals will not be allowed.  Please note that the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Section C of the RFP, and Attachment 1, the Performance Requirements Summary (PRS), and workload exhibits are very important documents and provide specific Information on workload, delivery and mandatory performance requirements that will be of assistance to all bidders in not only formulating your bid price, but determining whether or not to submit a proposal and may be included in the request for proposals. Once the offerors are evaluated and determined to be acceptable in Step 1, a (Call for Bids) will be issued by the contracting officer.  The Call for Bids will be issued approximately one week after all technical proposals are evaluated and debriefings occur as possible during the week of 9 August 2004.  At that time, all aspects of the RFP in Step 1 will become binding on the all parties when the call for bids is issued, and the actual delivery and performance requirements will be contained in the invitation for Bids (IFB) issued under step two.
 
Upon receipt of proposals, it is the duty of the contracting officer to- (1) Safeguard the technical proposals against disclosure to unauthorized persons (2) Accept and handle data marked in accordance with 15.609 as provided in that section; and (3) Any reference to price or cost in step 1 will automatically disqualify a proposal making it unacceptable on its face for failure to follow instructions. The contracting officer shall establish a time period for evaluating technical proposals shortly after close of the RFP. The period may vary with the complexity and number of proposals involved. Evaluation of proposals will be completed quickly as possible by a Technical Evaluation Team (TET) appointed by the CO. Evaluations shall be based on the criteria in the request for proposals but not consideration of responsibility as defined in 9.1, Proposals, shall be categorized as- Acceptable; Reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable; or Unacceptable. Any proposal which modifies, or fails to conform to the essential requirements or specifications of, the request for technical proposals shall be considered non-responsive and categorized as unacceptable on its face. 

Note that the contracting officer may proceed directly with step two if there are sufficient (at least two) acceptable technical proposals to ensure adequate price competition under step two, and if further time, effort and delay to make additional proposals acceptable and thereby increase competition would not be in the Government's interest. If this is not the case, the contracting officer shall request bidders whose proposals may be made acceptable to submit additional clarifying or supplementing information. The contracting office shall identify the nature of the deficiencies in the proposal or the nature of the additional information required. The contracting officer may also arrange discussions for this purpose. No proposal shall be discussed with any offeror other than the submitter. In initiating requests for additional information, the contracting officer shall fix an appropriate time for bidders to conclude discussions, if any, submit all additional information, and incorporate such additional information as part of their proposals submitted. Such time may be extended in the discretion of the contracting officer. If the additional information incorporated as part of a proposal within the final time fixed by the contracting officer establishes that the proposal is acceptable, it shall be so categorized. Otherwise, it shall be categorized as unacceptable.  When a technical proposal is found unacceptable (either initially or after clarification), the contracting officer shall promptly notify the offeror of the basis of the determination and that a revision of the proposal will not be considered. Upon written request, the contracting officer shall debrief unsuccessful offerors. Late technical proposals are governed by FAR 15.208 (b), (c), and (f). If it is necessary to discontinue two-step sealed bidding, the contracting officer shall include a statement of the facts and circumstances in the contract file.  Each offeror shall be notified in writing. When step one results in no acceptable technical proposal or only one acceptable technical proposal, it may be either continued by negotiation process, or if the only acceptable technical proposal is the Government’s Technical Proposal, the CO may declare the competition over and order implementation of the MEO by Letter of Obligation.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) is preparing for issuance of a Request for Quotes (RFQ) for the subject project.  USITC is soliciting comments from interested parties, in order to help draft a Scope of Work (Draft SOW).  This procurement will be restricted to vendors from GSA’s Schedule.  Your comments will be appreciated and considered as we create the RFQ for the proposed task order.  No information on Pricing, Competition, or Evaluation Criteria is available at this time.  

We would like to ask those responding to this RFI to consider the following issues-

  	1. Is your firm likely to respond to an RFQ of this type when issued? Would representatives of your firm consider meeting with USITC personnel to provide information on this topic prior to issuance of any RFQ?

2. Are there examples that show that combining the entire web presence of an enterprise into a single portal with common look-and-feel features is a recognized business practice that provides tangible value to users? 

3. Are there particular features of a Content Management System (CMS) that would be useful and valuable to the USITC as a tool for creating and managing web content? Are there tangible ways that this value could be recognized and measured?

4. Are there particular features of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and/or a Code Versioning System (CVS) that would be useful and valuable to the USITC as a tool for creating server functions and database access features that support the ITC portal? Are there tangible ways that this value could be recognized and measured?

5. Are there particular features of a control framework that would be useful and valuable to the USITC as a tool for integrating security, new services, and encapsulating legacy systems in support of web content? Are there tangible ways that this value could be recognized and measured?


6. The USITC has prototyped some services using open source software and has been favorably impressed with its reliability and functionality. Are there areas where open source software could lower USITC cost of acquisition without raising the cost of support and operations?

7. Which type of metadata management and website navigation tools are likely to produce the highest level of user satisfaction and productivity for USITC customers? Are there any significant cost trades-offs?

Comments may or may not be incorporated in the Statement of Work.  Comments will be accepted until April 2, 2004, 4:30 p.m. EST.  All comments shall be addressed to Deborah Kearns in writing at (Email preferred: Deborah.kearns@usitc.gov), fax:  202-205-2024, or by mail addressed:  USITC, 500 E Street, SW,  Attn:  Deborah Kearns, Deputy Chief Information Officer for Management, Room 412D, Washington, DC  20436.  Attached is a project overview.  The document is in MS Word and can be made available in WordPerfect.  


1. Project Identification and Scope


Background:

The ITC is reengineering the usitc.gov website into an enterprise portal, designed to reduce print publishing and mailing costs, while providing users with a more coherent tool for accessing information and services provided by the ITC. This project integrates several other previous projects.

The term “ITC enterprise portal architecture” describes the configuration of a set of several ITC systems merged together using tools that make them work as an integrated platform. The new ITC enterprise portal architecture will present a single point of entry for users on the Internet.  The portal tools should consist of centralized resources like those being used by most well run enterprises. 

We envision a phased build-out with Phase I consisting of basic tools like content management, light application service management, and search engine services that will be used to build our first consumer portal.  Initially, a low-impact approach to application integration will consist of simple links to transaction-based web applications, like EDIS and Dataweb.  Additional portal architecture tools, more powerful integration layers, automatic data format translation, interactive collaboration, and other functionality can be added in subsequent phases.

It is planned that the initial ITC portal project focus on content related issues. Thus the initial strategy described in this document will have the following orientation: instead of custom-developed software applications, the ITC portal should be built using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products whose features meet all current needs as well as anticipating the future of the ITC web portal.

 

Scope:

The focus of this project is not solely the web redesign effort. Since many other systems must integrate with the web, this section details areas of responsibility that it is desirable to integrate with the Web redesign project. For the consumer portal portion itself, the following domains of responsibility have been identified: the Internet (http://www.usitc.gov,) Intranet (http://intranet/,) and preparation /management of Electronic Publications.

Internet: USITC.GOV & related products

With respect to the internet, the project will focus on reorganizing content on the USITC.GOV Web site, improvement of business processes used to maintain that site, and improvements in the overall aesthetic presentation of the USITC.GOV Web site and other web products.

Project Responsibilities 
•	Improving Web site navigation through usability studies and graphical redesigns.
•	Defining and communicating standards, ensuring the creation of consistent and integrated Web content.
•	Identification and management of Web business processes, including internal controls on content posting and application management.
•	Creating page templates for use by authors.
•	Creating navigation templates, which control the navigational elements to the ITC site.
•	Configuring and maintaining of Web related applications, such as the proposed portal and content management software.
•	Revising future ITC portal structure, designs, and layouts, constantly improving usability and content-posting workflow.
•	Assigning users to groups and giving groups rights to subject-area pages.

Intranet: HTTP://INTRANET/ 

Regarding the intranet, the project will focus on reorganizing all content, improvement of business processes and technologies used to maintain the Intranet, and improvements in the overall aesthetic presentation.

Project Responsibilities 
•	Maintaining and posting content. 
•	Managing all intranet related Web projects for compliance with ITC’s strategic plan, ensuring adherence to the approved Web strategy. 
•	Identifying and managing Intranet business processes, including internal controls on content posting.
•	Creating page templates for use by content authors.
•	Creating navigation templates, which control the navigational elements to the ITC Intranet site.
•	Assigning users to groups, and giving groups rights to subject area content.
 

Electronic Publications

With respect to electronic publications, the project will focus on improvement of business processes used to electronically prepare and disseminate publications.

Project Responsibilities 
•	Working with the appropriate program areas, assessing the feasibility of transforming research content into an information-centric (rather than a publication-centric) information source.
•	Improving the web presentation of publications in a manner that allows visitors to find relevant documents faster and more efficiently than they can now.
•	Identifying and managing business processes relating to document preparation, ensuring that efficient workflows are being used by authors. 

	Enterprise Portal Infrastructure

With respect to the new enterprise portal infrastructure, the project uses the concept of “layers”. This project will focus on development of a presentation layer ,enterprise security layer, and application control layer.

 
Figure 1

The top three layers of the Portal consist of: general displays and access provided by the presentation layer; authentication (that is users logging in, and finding out what they can access) governed by the security layer, and the control layer acting as a traffic cop for managing applications and data retrieval.  

Developing naturally interrelated services like the diagram above, but doing so as independent heterogeneous applications could expose the agency to significant integration risks. Therefore, when building the components of the portal, the ITC will stick closely to a documented standard, which simplifies enterprise applications by basing them on common, modularized components. 

Using a common standard can also supply many details of application behavior automatically, freeing developers from complex programming, and allowing for upgrades of parts or modules of the system later, without breaking the entire system.

Maintainability and scalability are important for ITC’s technical infrastructure’s long-term viability. Re-using proven code can help build applications that operate reliably 24 x 7, enterprise-wide. One term for this type of software recycling is repurposeable resources, which are modules capable of working on many of the various systems. 

Multitier infrastructures like Figure 1 can be hard to architect and are only made more complex if heterogeneous standards and incompatible environments are used by different ITC systems. Doing so would require bringing together a wide variety of development skill-sets and development resources, which is needlessly expensive. 

The USITC will consider only the most widely accepted and well proven standards for integrating corporate web environments, examples being J2EE and .NET. Even with adopting a standard like these for the portal, ITC’s future environment may still include other existing or canned applications that have to integrate services from a variety of vendors with a diverse set of application models and even other standards. Good standards have ways of coping with this situation, like “encapsulation”, which resembles putting an adapter in your cars cigarette lighter so you can plug your cell-phone into it. The new USITC standard must be able to sit on top of a wide range of existing systems – EDIS III, DataWeb, ITC-NET, Library Management System, etc.. – it must create bridges between these systems.

 

2. Procurement Approach

The USITC intends to issue an RFQ which will utilize resources available from pre-competed contract vehicles such as the GSA schedules. It is currently planned that the USITC will seek a single integrating contractor rather than manage several separate contracts. This integrating contractor may perform all tasks associated with the RFQ, or may subcontract portions of the work, provided that the integrating contractor maintains overall responsibility and accountability for task completion.

The RFQ being developed will seek a contractor to both assist the USITC in gathering and analyzing user requirements, and in implementing hardware, software, and infrastructure to fulfill those requirements, as well as ongoing support of any developed systems.

Completion of the USITC Portal Project is intended to be accomplished through a combined effort of USITC and contractor resources. Contractor resources will be accessed through a series of task orders which will be executed to implement discrete phases and ancillary tasks associated with the project. It is therefore important that any respondent to the eventual RFQ demonstrate a depth of talented staff necessary to operate effectively in such a task order environment. Resources which will be sought in the RFQ should include the areas below.
 
A)	Skilled Personnel with experience in the following:
1)	Requirements Analysis and Planning
2)	Installation and use of  any proposed Content Management Software
3)	Installation and system integration with any proposed middleware
4)	Development of Java or other appropriate language code using any proposed IDE, and integration and encapsulation of legacy resources such as Oracle servers
5)	Server installation and system administration

     B) Hardware – any respondent may propose the use of hardware manufactured or sold directly by the respondent. Optionally, the respondent may provide specifications and sources from which the USITC may procure the needed hardware

     C) Software – any respondent may propose the use of COTS software developed or sold directly by the respondent. Optionally, the respondent may provide specifications and sources from which the USITC may procure the needed COTS software.

<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

Using your current production or anticipated design(s) as a technical  starting point, what would be the minimum timeframe, including long lead  procurement, and minimum number of test assets that would be required to  design, integrate, test, ensure adequate production capacity, and produce four  LRIP aircraft in both of the configurations listed above? PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 001 (6 Feb 04)- Industry Day Announcement  The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  SOF-CSAR SPO) will host an Industry Day on 4 March 2004 at the Holiday Inn in  Fairborn, Ohio to inform industry of a new program to develop and procure 132  Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This procurement activity is scheduled to  begin sometime later this year, and will be a very aggressive, quick moving  development program.  This Industry Day will be a one day event where the  program office will brief industry on what the program entails to ensure that  industry has an understanding of the requirements and intent of the PRV  program.    The agenda is being developed at this time.  It will include government  briefings on the program, possible acquisition strategies, operator  requirements and a question and answer session in the morning.  The afternoon  will be reserved for prime contractors to meet one-on-one with government  representatives to ask questions of a proprietary nature and describe their  unique abilities to meet the requirements stated in the operational  requirements document.    Individuals wishing to attend this Industry Day must register online via the  MarketSpace link at the bottom of this page.  This Industry Day is restricted  to United States citizens.  All attendees must present a government issued  photo identification, as well as a birth certificate or U.S. passport for registration on the day of the event.  The Industry Day will be oriented  toward rotary wing prime contractors; contractors who have the ability to  design and manufacture medium lift vertical take-off/landing medium lift class  vehicles.  Suppliers to these prime contractors will also be eligible to  attend.  Contractors who are interested in obtaining a copy of the draft Operational  Requirements Document (ORD) and a draft of the Statement of Objectives (SOO)  may request them by sending an e-mail message to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil. All  requests must include the company name as well as the Commercial and Government  Entity (CAGE) code.  REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 001 (6 Feb 04)- Industry Day Announcement  The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  SOF-CSAR SPO) will host an Industry Day on 4 March 2004 at the Holiday Inn in  Fairborn, Ohio to inform industry of a new program to develop and procure 132  Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This procurement activity is scheduled to  begin sometime later this year, and will be a very aggressive, quick moving  development program.  This Industry Day will be a one day event where the  program office will brief industry on what the program entails to ensure that  industry has an understanding of the requirements and intent of the PRV  program.    The agenda is being developed at this time.  It will include government  briefings on the program, possible acquisition strategies, operator  requirements and a question and answer session in the morning.  The afternoon  will be reserved for prime contractors to meet one-on-one with government  representatives to ask questions of a proprietary nature and describe their  unique abilities to meet the requirements stated in the operational  requirements document.    Individuals wishing to attend this Industry Day must register online via the  MarketSpace link at the bottom of this page.  This Industry Day is restricted  to United States citizens.  All attendees must present a government issued  photo identification, as well as a birth certificate or U.S. passport for registration on the day of the event.  The Industry Day will be oriented  toward rotary wing prime contractors; contractors who have the ability to  design and manufacture medium lift vertical take-off/landing medium lift class  vehicles.  Suppliers to these prime contractors will also be eligible to  attend.  Contractors who are interested in obtaining a copy of the draft Operational  Requirements Document (ORD) and a draft of the Statement of Objectives (SOO)  may request them by sending an e-mail message to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil. All  requests must include the company name as well as the Commercial and Government  Entity (CAGE) code.  REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>THE DUE DATE HAS BEEN CHANGED TO AUGUST 13, 2004

The discovery, development, and evaluation of promising HIV microbicides is a high priority for the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH).  To augment the microbicide product pipeline, we are seeking opportunities to advance microbicide concepts toward the product stage via a focused, product development-based approach.  Specifically, the long-range goal of this solicitation is the development of new safe and effective microbicide candidates that merit further evaluation in large human trials. The HIV Microbicide Design and Development Teams (HMDDT) solicitation seeks to fund consortia of scientists with product development experience from industry and/or academia that have 1) identified a promising microbicide concept, and 2) devised a plan for its targeted development into a product testable in humans.  A microbicide product is defined here to be a material and its manner of administration that could reasonably provide protection against the sexual transmission of HIV safely, even when used repeatedly.  The expectation is that the Teams advance their microbicide concepts along a well-defined development path in a timely manner to a microbicide product and into clinical testing within the five-year period of the award.  Offerors are encouraged, but not required to conduct phase I/II trials in collaboration with the NIH/NIAID/DAIDS-supported HIV Prevention Trials Network (the HPTN; http://www.hptn.org). Support for Phase III studies will not be funded under this solicitation.  

Because the goal of this effort is the development of microbicide products, each Team will be required to demonstrate proven scientific and development expertise, and provide a comprehensive plan that lays out clearly defined objectives and milestones for the project’s duration.  Because the design and development path for any microbicide product cannot be entirely anticipated, the Team must articulate its vision of how new scientific findings will be integrated into the proposed goals and milestones.  Offerors will be required to articulate and implement a strategic research plan that includes: (a) key development objectives and a detailed work plan describing proposed time schedules for achieving contract objectives and milestones, and maintaining quality control over the implementation and operation of the contract, (b) how decisions to proceed or not proceed will be made (i.e. specific qualitative and quantitative criteria for product advancement through each stage of pre-clinical, including IND-enabling, development and Phase I/II safety evaluations), (c) plans for GMP microbicide lot production and packaging, and (d) obtaining the necessary regulatory and human subjects approvals to proceed.  This strategic plan shall articulate how the Team will efficiently allocate and utilize the resources, and redirect the focus (including reallocation of funds) depending upon the project’s changing needs and emerging new knowledge.  It shall, also, articulate how patent coverage and licensing of the resulting HIV microbicide will be obtained and the procedures to be followed for the resolution of potential legal issues that may arise.

It is anticipated that up to two (2) cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately February 15, 2005. RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIDS-04-04 will be available electronically on or about February 25, 2004, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page by using the following electronic address and instructions:

NIAID/CMP Home Page (via the WWW): Use http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract to access the NIAID/CMP Home Page.  Once at the NIAID/CMP Home Page, click on the "RFPs" link and then click on "RFP NIH-NIAID-DAIDS-04-04."

Please note that the RFP has been revised to include only the Work Statement, Deliverable and Reporting Requirements, Special Requirements, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and the Specific RFP Instructions and Provisions.  All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package. 

Responses to this RFP will be due on July 27, 2004.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal for consideration by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.   No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The purpose of the modification to the presolicitation notice is to change the response date from 3/31/04 to 3/24/04.  No other changes were made to the posting.*****The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with the State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, a requirement to provide assistance to the Manufacturing Systems Integration Division to develop complex control and communication systems for an optical trapping instrument.  The software development to be performed shall build on a sequence of software prototypes and performance tests executed over the past year.  The tests and prototypes are the basis for the conceptual design of the controllers to be developed, and a detailed understanding of the principles learned is central to designing and building the new control system.  The University of Buffalo is uniquely qualified because they are the only source that possesses the requisite knowledge of optical trapping physics, and optical manipulation, network programming and data acquisition systems.  They also have extensive experience using the following specialized packages including: (1) Neutral Messaging Language, (2) wxWindows, (3) the Ghost SDK for the Phantom haptic device (from Sensable Technologies) and (5) the NIDAQ API (from National Instruments Instrumentation).   *** The period of performance shall be one (1) year from the date of award. *** The Government anticipates the award of a fixed price purchase order.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations and no solicitation package will be issued.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note 22 & Note 26.

The successful firm(s) will be required to purchase the existing systems from the Government and may be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the Government.  The resulting contract(s), if awarded, will require the Contractor(s) to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s).  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor(s) shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement (an example will be attached to the RFP).  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The Contractor(s) proposals and plans may become a part of the contract upon the decision to award.  Past Performance information from potential Offeror's shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  No Offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.  The utility systems being privatized are described as follows:  
FORT MCPHERSON:
Fort McPherson is located in the city of Atlanta, four miles southwest of downtown. It covers 487 acres of well-landscaped grounds. Fort McPherson operates a sub-post, Fort Gillem, which is a 1,500-acre site located 10 miles southeast of Atlanta.  Electrical Distribution System:  Fort McPherson currently purchases electric power at 12.5 kV from Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) at a single primary delivery point. Two Georgia Power 34.5 kV transmission circuits, one overhead construction and one underground supply the central commercial area.  Fort McPherson owns and operates an electrical distribution system consisting of: one 12.5 kV distribution substation; approximately 4.3 circuit miles of overhead primary distribution line; and approximately 2.8 circuit miles of underground primary distribution line.  The main substation, which supplies the entire Installation, consists of two incoming 34.5 kV transmission line bays, two 7.5 MVA 34.5 – 12.5 kV transformers, three 333 kVA voltage regulators, and five 12.5 kV feeder vacuum circuit breakers. Georgia Power owns the 34.5 kV switching and protective equipment, and the two power transformers. Fort McPherson owns the 12.5 kV vacuum circuit breakers.  The primary distribution system consists of five 12.5 kV circuits. The distribution system is composed primarily of overhead, pole-line construction (which is conventional, open wire construction) with pole-mounted transformer banks. In addition, there is also a small amount of underground primary construction, utilizing both direct burial and duct type construction practices.
Natural Gas Distribution System:
Fort McPherson purchases its natural gas requirements from Atlanta Gas Light Company (“AGL”), under interruptible gas Schedule I-21 Commercial Rate.  A Propane Air Plant located at Fort McPherson was constructed, and is owned and operated by a contractor, Systems Corp.  The natural gas or the propane air mixture (during natural gas interruption) is distributed throughout the Installation through a distribution system with pipes ranging in size from less than two inches to six inches in diameter.  The total length of the system is 50,500 linear feet, serving about 103 buildings.  The system was originally installed in the 1950s; however, some of the system was installed as late as 1986 and 1996. PLEASE NOTE:  Fort McPherson will require all future renewals/replacements/upgrades of overhead lines, pole mounted transformers and all overhead facilities to be replaced with underground line, pad mounted transformers, and underground facilities. 

FORT GILLEM:
Fort Gillem is a sub-post of Fort McPherson. Fort McPherson is located in the city of Atlanta, four miles southwest of downtown. It covers 487 acres of well-landscaped grounds. Fort Gillem is a 1,500-acre site located in Forest Park, 10 miles southeast of Atlanta. Fort Gillem is home for the 1st U.S. Army and the U.S. Army Southeast Region Recruiting Command.  Electrical Distribution System Description:  Fort Gillem currently purchases electrical power at 12.5 kV from Georgia Power at a single primary delivery point near the north boundary of the Installation. Fort Gillem owns and operates an electrical distribution system consisting of: one 12.5 kV distribution substation; approximately 17.1 circuit miles of overhead primary distribution line; and approximately 1.0 circuit mile of underground primary distribution line.  The main substation, which supplies the entire compound, is a conventional, outdoor, air-insulated substation consisting of two incoming 115 kV transmission line bays, one 20 MVA 115 – 12.5 kV power transformer, and a 12.5 kV secondary structure. The secondary structure is configured with a main oil-filled circuit breaker, a main and transfer bus, voltage regulators, and four feeder oil-filled circuit breakers. Georgia Power owns the 115 kV switching and protective equipment, and the power transformer. Fort Gillem owns the 12.5 kV structure, buswork, voltage regulators, and oil-filled circuit breakers. This substation provides voltage regulation, control, and over-current protection for four 12.5 kV overhead feeders.  The majority of the distribution circuits are configured with loop tie switches to neighboring circuits. The distribution system is composed primarily of overhead, pole-line construction (which is narrow-profile, open wire construction) with pole-mounted transformer banks. There is also a small amount of underground primary construction (utilizing duct type construction practices and pad-mounted transformers). The major underground primary facilities are arranged in a looped configuration.  Natural Gas Distribution System: Fort Gillem purchases its natural gas requirements from Atlanta Gas Light Company (AGL), under interruptible gas schedule I-21 Commercial Rate.  There is a Propane Air Plant at Fort Gillem that is owned and operated by a contractor, Systems Corp.  The natural gas or the propane air mixture (during natural gas interruption) is distributed throughout the installation through a distribution system with pipes ranging in size from less than two inches to six inches in diameter.  The total length of the system is 63,030 linear feet, serving about 119 buildings.  The present gas system was installed in 1996.  PLEASE NOTE:  Fort Gillem will require all future renewals / replacements / upgrades of overhead lines, pole mounted transformers and all overhead facilities to be replaced with underground line, pad mounted transformers, and underground facilities.

<RESPDATE>040204
<ARCHDATE>06012004
<CONTACT>lorraine.mcmullen, (716)879-4249
<DESC>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the Ashtabula River Partnership have proposed a plan for initial ecosystem restoration in the Ashtabula River, Ashtabula Ohio.  The project scope covers contaminated sediment dredging, dewatering, water treatment, transportation and disposal.  The Ashtabula River is located in northeast Ohio on the southeast shores of Lake Erie.  In 1985, the area was designated as an Area of Concern (AOC) by the International Joint Commission (IJC), cha racterizing it as an area with impaired beneficial uses.  The impaired beneficial uses were derived in part from the presence of contaminated sediment.  Much of the sediment in the river is sufficiently contaminated to require environmental controls during  dredging.  Primary contaminants of concern in the lower Ashtabula River include numerous chlorinated organic compounds, in particular polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH); heavy metals such as cadmium, mercury, lead, and zinc;  and low level radionuclides (RAD) such as uranium, radium, and thorium.  These contaminants have been detected in Ashtabula River sediments, water, and fish. A recommended remedial plan involves: 1.) mechanical dredging of approximately 700,000 cubic yards (in situ) of contaminated sediments from the river, 2.) treatment of the sediments as necessary to meet disposal requirements, 3.) transporting to and dispos al of the treated sediment in either a Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and / or non-TSCA (NTSCA) permitted landfill (based upon previously established cut-lines and chemical analysis).  The disposal facility must also be permitted to accept low-level r adionuclides.   Additional project information can be found in the project Comprehensive Management Plan (CMP) (ftp://ftp.usace.army.mil/Incoming/LRB/Ashtabula/Feasibility/ ). INFORMATION SOUGHT:  The intent of this Sources Sought Announcement is the generation of information regarding potentially qualified parties capable of providing a comprehensive approach that utilizes the most effective and efficient means to dispose of As htabula River project sediments.  This includes all transportation logistical support and coordination necessary to meet the anticipated project schedule including transportation of sediment to the disposal facility, the acceptance of sediment shipments at  the disposal facility, off-loading of sediments at the disposal facility, and final disposal of the sediments. USACE is interested in submissions related to one or more of the following possible contaminated sediment disposal alternatives: 1.	Transportation to, and disposal of the project TSCA and NTSCA sediments in, a currently existing and appropriately permitted facility;  and /or 2.	Transportation to, and disposal of the project TSCA and NTSCA sediments in, an appropriately permitted facility to be constructed, operated, closed, maintained and monitored for the use of this project.  Such a facility could be constructed at a locatio n considered in the CMP, or at an alternate location proposed by the responder. Treated sediment disposal information submitted should be pertinent and specific to the subject project on each of the following qualifications: 1.	Experience:  An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed; 2.	Personnel:  Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of technical personnel who may be assigned as a principal team member or project officer; and 3.	Asset Capability:  Availability and description of special facilities or assets capable of accomplishing the technical objectives under consideration.   4.	Any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to the specific objective that would enhance our understanding of the information submitted. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS Firms having the capabilities to perform this work are invited to submit two (2) copies of an overview narrative inte nded to demonstrate the firmÃ¢Â€Â™s understanding of, and unique qualifications to successfully complete the subject project.  This overview narrative shall include a list of relevant projects that the firm has worked on, the unique problems addressed on e ach project, and the firmÃ¢Â€Â™s approach to addressing such problems. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS iF YOU RESPONDED TO THE INITIAL INQUIRY YOU DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND AGAIN

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Program Manager for Navy Marine Corps Intranet and Information Technology Infrastructure (PM NMCI/ITI), is conducting a market survey to determine qualified computer software vendors capable of meeting a Marine Corps need for Active Directory and Exchange migration/synchronization software.  The specific requirements for each unit or domain at a minimum include:

1.	All NT user accounts and passwords must be migrated into Windows 200x Active Directory, while SID history is also migrated, so users can continue to access resources in the source domain.

2.	All source domain shared data must be migrated to the target domain while maintaining access by updating the associated permissions to reflect the new accounts in the target domain so user access to the data is uninterrupted.

3.	All migration steps must be accomplished without interrupting the end user.  For example: The end user must not be forced logout, leave the workstation for another, remember a new password or provide any password to any migration administrator.

4.	The migration application must permit coexistence and synchronization of all Exchange server source and target data.  This data includes shared calendars, public folders, permissions and mailboxes, so users are not divided between two environments.  The application allows users to continue sending and receiving e-mail, access calendars and public folders seamlessly during all stages of the migration.

5.	The migration application must transfer all public folder data and update permissions to reflect new mailboxes in the target organization.

6.	The migration application must update the permissions on all objects, Outlook profiles, and user profiles on workstations from a central point so all users retain all services and capabilities that were available to them within the source domain.

7.	The migration application must transfer user mailboxes and maintain up-to-date calendars and free/busy data to provide seamless collaboration between the source and target domains during the migration period.

8.	The migration application must conduct all migration steps from a centralized point with no requirement for an administrator to physically touch an end user workstation other than to double check for possible errors.

The goal of this effort is to identify a set of candidate applications; identify their associated risk constraints; and examine such factors as affordability, maturity, commerciality, and other market considerations.   Vendors of commercial products that meet the above minimum requirements are invited to submit their capabilities statement.  The following materials must be included in the submission:
·	Statement of capabilities;
·	Current GSA schedule contract information and pricing schedule or other contract means; and,
·	Other matter directly addressing the products ability to meet the aforementioned needs (interested vendors must address all 8 requirements/capabilities)

Interested firms are requested to respond NLT 22 April 2004, identifying their business size and corporate point of contact.  Interested sources should respond to: (U. S. Mail address) Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN : PM NMCI/ITI (R. A. Glover) 2200 Lester Street,  Quantico, VA 22134-5010 .  Express/overnight deliveries should us the same address.  Any questions regarding the submission of materials should be addressed to Ms Christine Kuney, (703 784-0883).  THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEM/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health intends to procure on a sole source basis to Dr. Lisa Bachenheimer and Dr. Tom Gambon to provide anesthesiologist services.  The period of performance shall be for a single twelve (12) month period.  Specifically, the contractor shall be responsible for providing complete anesthesiology services to the NIH Clinical Center for five (5) days per week as scheduled, from 7:00am to 3:30pm exclusive of Federal Holidays.  The anesthesiologist must be dedicated to the Clinical Center during the hours and days specified.  The Contractor shall participate in at least 6 primary call rotations per month to provide emergency anesthetic services, including holiday weeks.  The Government will maintain a designate on-call list, and personnel will report during non-regular hours within one (1) hour following notification.  It is believed that Dr. Lisa Bachenheimer and Dr. Tom Gambon are the sole sources for the requirement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements) because of the following: First, the Clinical Center treats patients with complex, rare and advanced stage diseases who are enrolled in experimental protocols.  As a result, surgical procedures performed at the Clinical Center are very unusual, complex and are not often performed anywhere else in the country.  Anesthesiologists who service the Clinical Center must be proficient in all anesthetic techniques and invasive procedures.  In addition, all anesthesiologists must be able to treat all age groups and have a broad knowledge of all the rare diseases that are treated at the Clinical Center.  Dr. Bachenheimer and Gambon have previously serviced the NIH and both have the necessary skills as listed above.  Furthermore, they are currently credentialed to work in the Clinical Center.  This reduces the need for training which could potentially cause cancellation of surgical and off-site cases and it also enhances their ability to work independently and assures continuity of our operating rooms activities.  This is crucial due to the current shortage of anesthesiologists at the Clinical Center and the increased caseload.  Secondly, Dr. Bachenheimer and Gambon have the ability to arrive at the Clinical Center within one hour of notification for emergency cases.  It is crucial that the contractor be able to report at the clinical center within one hour because emergencies do happen frequently as a result of the complex nature of the Clinical Center’s surgical caseload.  This ability also allows the Clinical Center maximum flexibility to substitute last minute surgical cases.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting market research to identify sources which are capable of processing mission critical data from ground tactical equipment systems in a real, or near real-time manner from austere environments under various climatic conditions.  The current method of tracking ground tactical equipment mission critical data is manpower intensive, untimely, voluminous, subject to inaccuracies, and requires expansive communication assets.  Autonomic Logistics (AL) provides a superior capability for reporting mission critical data (Equipment Health, Identification, Location, Fuel and Ammunition Levels, and Mobile Loads) in legacy and emerging systems.  AL addresses deficiencies inherent in the current reporting systems and can be utilized throughout the spectrum of Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) operations.  The capability will interface with existing/planned Combat Service Support (CSS), Command and Control (C2), and Automated Information Systems (AIS) through legacy and emerging logistics communication systems.  The objective AL capability will provide critical logistic data (Equipment Health, Identification, Location, Fuel and Ammunition Levels, and Mobile Loads) for operational equipment through a netted sensor network and into the CSS information network.  Interfaces with external data networks will further reduce request to fulfillment (RTF), or logistics delay time.  AL will be incorporated into legacy and emerging select Marine Corps ground tactical equipment.  The Marine Requirements Oversight Council / Marine Corps Review Board (MROC / MCRB) will recommend candidate AL weapons systems and equipment to the PM.  AL will complement Joint Vision 2020 and operate within the Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare (EMW) environment.  Supported applications will be able to interact with onboard combat support systems to automatically generate AL data, but also allow for manual input of data, as well as identifying disabling conditions.  To the maximum extent possible, the AL system will utilize legacy and emerging communications devices, onboard sensors, and interface with current and emerging AISs.  Interested sources should go to MARCORSYSCOM’s website at http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/ctq/al.asp for additional information regarding the AL Program as well as for specific submission instructions.

<SUBJECT>R--Maintenance of the GeneTests Database
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Washington, Seattle, WA for a cost reimbursement type contract for the creation and maintenance of records in the GeneTests database.  GeneTests is a database that contains the following principal components:  (1) peer-reviewed descriptions of genetic diseases written by subject matter experts including curated information on genetic tests for diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling; (2) a directory of laboratories which perform research and clinical testing for genetic disorders; (3) a directory of U.S. and international genetics clinics which provide genetic evaluation and genetic counseling services.  GeneTests contains over 210 disease descriptions written by clinical and laboratory experts and peer-reviewed by both an internal and external group of reviewers.  The disease descriptions follow a consistent format including topics on clinical descriptions, diagnosis, management, counseling, molecular genetics, and resources.  Each entry is regularly updated in a formal review process.  The laboratory directory includes over 570 laboratories performing clinical testing for 639 diseases and research on 350 diseases.  Testing includes DNA-based, cytogenetic, and biochemical tests.  Each entry contains the name, symbol, and synonyms for the tested gene, the chromosomal locus, laboratory personnel and genetics board certifications.  The clinics directory has over 1080 clinics listed with information on the staff certification, services provided, specialty clinics and contact information.  Educational materials are also available which provide a medical genetics glossary and explanations of genetic testing and consultation.  The purpose of this contract is to ensure the continuance of GeneTests as a comprehensive and up to date source of genetic testing information for a diverse audience that includes both healthcare professionals as well as the lay public.    Specifically, this contract will add to and continuously update the content within each of the GeneTests resources as new information becomes available from the various scientific and clinical disciplines related to inherited disease susceptibility.  For GeneReviews the selection of disease profiles is based upon the availability of clinical testing procedures, the importance of testing in diagnosis, risk counseling, and early treatment.   Entries are created and peer-reviewed by scientists and clinicians recognized as experts for that specific disorder.  An in-house review process assures editorial consistency and integration of GeneReviews with the other GeneTests resources.  The content of the GeneTests database is copyrighted by the University of Washington and Children’s Health System.  The staff at the University of Washington have regularly been maintaining and updating the database since 1992 when the Laboratory Directory was established, followed by the GeneReviews disease descriptions in 1997.  Because the compilation of laboratories and of structured, expert-authored and peer-reviewed disease descriptions is unique, because the University of Washington owns the rights to the data, and because the University of Washington maintains the GeneTests database, it has been determined that the University of Washington is the only source capable of fulfilling NLM’s requirements.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is an RFP available.

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has proposed to modify its small business size standards by establishing size standards in terms of the number of employees of a business concern for most industries and SBA programs.  This change will reduce the number of different size standard levels and at the same time simplify size standards and their application to Federal Government programs.  Under this proposal, size standards will range from 50 employees to 1,500 employees, depending on the industry or SBA program.

<p />
For a limited number of industries, SBA proposed to establish a maximum average annual receipts amount (referred to as a receipts cap) along with the employee-based size standard.  Concerns in those industries that meet the employee-based size standard also cannot exceed a specific receipts cap to qualify as an eligible small business.

<p />To further simplify size standards, SBA also proposed the following: (1) modify the size standard for the Surety Bond Guarantee (SBG) Program by replacing the $6 million size standard with the requirement that the contractor meet the size standard for its primary industry; (2) extend the 125,000 barrels per calendar day component of the size standard for petroleum refiners beyond Federal Government procurement to all Federal small business programs using SBA’s size standards; (3) eliminate the special size standard based on market share for tire manufacturers that applies to only Federal Government procurement; (4) modify three receipts-based size standards and one employee-based size standard for the sale or lease of Government property; and, (5) revise the nonmanufacturer size standard applicable to Federal procurements from 500 employees to 100 employees, the same size standard that applies to wholesale trade businesses and all other SBA programs. 

<p />
SBA has prepared a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) to help understand the proposed rule and its implications.  SBA cautions that the FAQ are meant merely to simplify some of the more basic concepts of the proposed rule, and they cannot replace reading the proposed rule itself.  Interested parties should submit comments based on the proposed rule, rather than on the FAQ.  

<p />You may read and/or download the proposed rule, published in the Federal Register on March 19, 2004, together with the FAQ, on SBA's website at http://www.sba.gov/size/indexwhatsnew.html#restructurePR.  The proposed rule is also available at http://www.regulations.gov.

<p />SBA must receive all comments to the proposed rule by May 18, 2004.

In addition, familiarity with SIS databases is desirable because integration with the other SIS databases will be a component of this concept. (2) Chemical-oriented scenario and prototype user interface – Based on direction from the government, the contractor shall develop a storyboard(s) with artist drawings/sketches to support a children’s chemical-based scenario for “Tox Mysteries”.  Development of the storyboard will be through an iterative design process, working closely with the government information specialists.  If the storyboard design is approved for implementation, then the contractor will develop a web-based prototype of the scenario.  Formal training in Fine Arts as well as experience in rendering drawings in the digital web environment is required.  Experience in teaching and preparation of educational materials is highly desirable.  Experience in development of children’s education computer games or interactive, learning web sites is required.  Expertise in programming and software design and development, plus state-of-the-art multimedia IT technologies used in software development is also required (e.g., Flash, Java programming language).  Experience in development of biomedical application, particularly with chemical-oriented focus is highly desirable.  (3) Consulting services for information visualization – The contractors shall provide consulting services as needed related to the implementation of the SIS Information Visualization plan and other tasks and projects associated with SIS responsibilities with respect to visualization.  Expertise in multimedia technologies and graphic design is required for this task.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. 5114-4-0006 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-20.  The solicitation is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 334516.  For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business standard is 500 employees.  The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, MWA, National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research, (NCAUR), Peoria, IL, has a requirement/need for a Stopped-Flow Reaction Analyzer System.  The need is for a high performance automated stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter with comprehensive absorption and fluorescence capability, two observation cells supplied in removable cell cartridges (20 uL and 5 uL) biocompatible microvolume sample flow circuit, full anaerobic capability, large ratio asymmetric mixing facility (when used with difference volume drive syringes), sequential- (double-) mixing capability, a PC with 1.6 Mb/floppy drive, CD-R/W drive, 64Mb RAM, 4Gb hard drive, high resolution multisync color monitor and 360 dpi color printer and comprehensive data acquisition and analysis.  Listed are the description of items and quantities required: CLIN No. 1 - Stopped-Flow Analyzer System (1 unit); CLIN No. 2 - Quench-Flow Adapter (1 unit); CLIN No. 3 - hotodiode-array detector (1 unit); CLIN No. 4 - Pro-Kineticist Global Analysis and simulation for Window '9x/NT (1 unit); CLIN No. 5 - Installation, Demonstration, Training (1 unit); and CLIN No. 6 - One year parts and labor warranty.  The reaction analyzer will be used to monitor the progress of chemical reactions using differences in fluorescence or absorbance properties between the products and reactants. The system also allows for the collection of small samples of a reaction against time for determination of reaction progress by other means. The rapid mixing system allows for the determination of rate constants for reactions as fast as 3000 per second.  THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS: the Analyzer must meet or include these minimum requirements: (1) Must be supplied with two observation cells that fit in removable cell cartridges. The cells must be: a 20-microlitre cell with a dead-time of 1.1 ms or better, and a 5 uL cell with a dead-time of only 450 us. (2) Must be supplied with a quench-flow adapter. (3) The 20 uL cell must offer pathlenghts of 10mm AND 2 mm for fluorescence detection. The use of a 2mm pathlength will significantly reduce artifacts due to self-absorption (the inner-filtering effect). (4) Must be supplied as standard with dedicated photomultipliers for absorbence and fluorescence detection.

OMBUDSMAN NOTICE – NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).    Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.    Informal forum with the Ombudsman.    Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. ATTENTION: Minority, Women-owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs)!

<DESC>This notice is part of a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes Step 1 of a 2-Step Sealed Bid solicitation; information to determine the offerors technical capability to meet the requirements is requested in this notice.  A written solicitation will be issued at a later date, only to those offerors deemed technically capable in Step 1.  The written solicitation will constitute Step 2 and require offerors to submit firm prices in the form of a Sealed Bid. This notice is being issued as a Invitation for Bids (IFB) for Liquid Oxygen (IAW MIL-PRF-25508F) and Liquid Nitrogen (IAW MIL-PRP-27401D) products.  Delivery of products by over-the-road, bulk cryogenic tanker trucks is required.  The approximate size of deliveries is 25 tons per tanker truck.  Multiple truck loads per day may be required.  Delivery of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen to Stennis Space Center (SSC), Bay St. Louis, MS and delivery of liquid nitrogen to Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF), Michoud, LA, FOB destination is required.  The Best Estimated Quantities (BEQ) for bulk liquid oxygen per year is 20,000 tons and liquid nitrogen per year is 40,000 tons for SSC and liquid nitrogen per year is 4,437 tons for MAF.  Routine requirements are 6 tankers of liquid oxygen/day for test periods (3 tankers offloaded at the same time, followed immediately by 3 more tankers) and maximum requirement of 12 tankers per day on infrequent days; 6 tankers of liquid nitrogen/day, 5 days/week (1 tanker offloaded at a time). The period of performance will be 1 July 2004 through 30 June 2007 as the base period with two one-year option periods.   A fixed price requirements type contract is planned for each product, however, one contractor could supply both products under a single contract.	However, an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract for the delivery of liquid oxygen may be issued as a dual source split requirement arrangement to SSC only, if a business case warrants this arrangement to be in the best interest of the government.  Under either arrangement, the Kennedy Space Center will award and administer the prime contract(s), while personnel at SSC and MAF will issue funded delivery orders and receive shipments in accordance with the contract.  Request for Shipment will be placed with a minimum of 48 hours notice prior to the required delivery time. Prospective offerors are required to provide the following information to determine technical capability for Step 1.	Technical proposals shall not include prices or pricing information. 1.  Discuss your production, storage and distribution facilities that will be used to produce and deliver liquid oxygen and/or liquid nitrogen requirements.  Provide a table listing for each plant location (primary and backup) the types and amounts of products produced per day (in tons for each product), storage capacity (in tons for each product), transportation fleet (no. of tanker-trucks, average age, capacities, driver staff and capacity), one-way distance and transit time from plant to delivery point. 2.  Discuss your quality management systems and safety program, including your top level mission statement and/or goals.	Complete quality/safety directives/operating procedures are not required, but may be referenced.  Discuss the level of corporate commitment to quality and safety. 3.  Past Performance – discuss any contracts you have performed in the last 3 years to provide these MIL-SPEC products to the government and/or commercial customers.  For each contract, provide the type of product delivered, quantity per year and length of service to that customer.

Statement of Objectives
Asbestos Labeling 
Altus AFB, Oklahoma

1.	Background
Past building inspections have identified asbestos-containing materials (ACM) in many facilities at Altus AFB (AAFB).  These inspections were conducted utilizing the Air Force Guidance for Rating and Assessing Damage and Exposure (GRADE) System, USAFOEHL Report 89-072EH0021HGA.    Current records indicate approximately 47 facilities at AAFB have mechanical rooms containing ACM.  Many of the GRADE 1 or 2 materials are known to be located in crawlspaces, attics, or other confined areas.  Re-assessment of the condition of these materials was performed in 2003.  
Information developed during the 1995 inspections has been input into an in-house database system known as Personal Computer View 3 (PCV3) for managing both asbestos and lead-based paint (LBP).  Altus AAFB has converted this database to an ACCESS based database.  The 2003 reassessment is contained in a separate report maintained by 97 CES/CEV. 
2.	Objectives
The objective for this project is to label all ACM located in the mechanical rooms in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1001 (j) (4).2.1	Labeling of ACM in the Mechanical Rooms
The Base will provide a list of targeted facilities requiring labeling.  The Base will provide the contractor with the latest asbestos data on all targeted facilities.  This data will be in either electronic form data or hard copy form dependent on the needs of the contractor.
Contractor will develop plan for labeling all identified ACM within the mechanical.  This plan will be submitted to the base for review to ensure access to all facilities can be coordinated in a timely manner. 
Contractor will provide requested information to AAFB on all visiting contractors, prior to arrival, to allow for security clearances to be conducted.
Contractor will perform the requested labeling of those materials agreed on by both the contractor and the base.

Statement of Objectives
Asbestos Database Upgrade 
Altus AFB, Oklahoma

1.	Background
Past building inspections have identified asbestos-containing materials (ACM) in many facilities at Altus AFB (AAFB).  Information developed during past inspections has been input into an in-house database system known as Personal Computer View 3 (PCV3) for managing both asbestos and lead-based paint (LBP).  This database is a DOS based database and is difficult to manage and difficult to input updated information.  Also, the Air Force is moving to incorporate environmental data, including asbestos and lead based paint data, into the ESOMIS database system.  This will occur in the next few years.  The PCV3 database will not allow the current data to transfer into the ESOHMIS database
2.	Objectives
Two major objectives exist for this project: 1) Develop a Microsoft ACCESS database for asbestos and Lead Based Paint and transfer existing data from PCV3 to the new ACCESS database; 2) Provide training to selected Altus AFB personnel on the use and upkeep of the new database..

The Base will provide the contractor with a copy of the current PCV3 asbestos and lead based paint database
Contractor will develop an ACCESS database capable of retrieving, updating and manipulating asbestos and LBP information from all facilities surveyed in the 1994-1995 survey.  
Contractor will migrate all information contained in the PCV3 database to the new ACCESS database
Contractor will provide the base with a user’s manual type of instructions for managing the new database.  These instructions shall be in electronic version, allowing the base to reproduce the instructions as necessary.
2.2	     Training
Contractor will provide a one time on site training to selected base personnel.  This training will cover use and management of the asbestos and LBP database
The base will determine which personnel are to receive this training.  All training will be conducted in one session.

Broken roots on bare-root trees should be trimmed back with sharp pruning shears.  Thin 30% of foliage of tree crown to accommodate reduction in roots system.  Install suitable plant nutrient supplement in tablet form per inch of tree trunk.  Set the tree in the hole with the old soil mark (i.e. where the bark is discolored on the main stem) at the ground level or slightly below. Drive in a stake for support if required. 
Work the soil down between the roots or under the curve of the root ball, firming it periodically to avoid air pockets. 
If setting a soil ball, which is firm, remove the burlap beforehand. If it is not firm, soil may be placed in the hole so that it comes about half way up the soil ball. This soil should be packed firmly, perhaps by tramping on it and then water the tree thoroughly. Once the water has disappeared the burlap should be cut off and folded down on top of the tramped soil. Next, the hole may be completely filled with soil, which can be tramped and watered again. 

6.   SCHEDULING OF WORK:  The contractor shall submit a proposed schedule for all work to be done under this project.  Any change must have prior approval from the Contracting Officer at least 3 working days prior to commencement of work.

7.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The work to be accomplished under this contract shall consist of removing and transplanting about 130 trees in accordance with this SOW, acceptable commercial practices, local, state and federal regulations.  

8.  INSPECTION:  Before submitting a proposal on the work contemplated, contractor should examine the site of the proposed work and be thoroughly familiarize with all existing conditions and limitations affecting the performance of this work.  No extra compensation will be allowed because of misunderstanding as to the amount of work involved or bidder's lack of knowledge of any existing conditions which he could have discovered or reasonably anticipated prior to bidding.  

9.  WORK SCHEDULE:  Normal working hours for the contractor will be between the hours of 7:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays.  If the contractor desires to work during periods other than above, additional government inspection forces may be required.  The contractor must make his/her request to the Contracting Officer three (3) days in advance of his/her 
intentions to work during other periods to allow assignment of additional inspection forces.  If such force is reasonably available, the Contracting Officer may authorize the contractor to perform work during periods other than normal duty hours/days. 

10.  RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR:  The contractor assumes full responsibility for any and all government property damaged in whole or part from negligent acts or omissions by the contractor, subcontractor, or any employee, agent, or representative of the contractor.  The contractor also agrees to reimburse the government for any and all damage of whatever kind to any and all government property associated with the performance of this service.

Items 1.0; 2.1; 2.3; 2.4
1)     Thirty-one (31) 12-volt batteries equal a DC bus of 372 volts.  If the specification of the DC bus on the ups indicated is accurately reported as 422 volts, the 31 battery requirement per cabinet seems inaccurate.
