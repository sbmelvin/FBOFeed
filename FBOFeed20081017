<DESC>AETC has a need to convert approximately 3300 hours (28+ courses) of classroom based courseware to Distance Learning in less than two years.  The objective of this program is to be able to reduce TDY to school costs while providing the training to our Airmen anytime, anywhere.  This supports the AFSO 21 program and is in line with both AFSO 21 and AETC goals.

Converting the required courses to Computer Based Training (CBT) is considered commercial in nature since it is the same service that is provided to the general public.  The final delivered product must be 100% operable with the AETC Advanced Distribution Learning System (ADLS).

The anticipated Solicitation release date is on or about 3 November 2008.  The solicitation will be a competitive 8(a) set-aside that will result in up to four indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract awards.

All anticipated task orders for converting classes will be placed by 30 September 2009, with final deliveries and acceptance of converted classes occurring NLT 30 September 2010. 

Hard copies of documentation will not be made available.  All communication concerning this presolicitation notice should be addressed to 1st Lt Bryce Fiacco and Mr. Kevin Shackleford via E-mail.

<SUBJECT>Spacelift Range Goup (LRRG) Lead System Integrator (LSI) Request for Information (RFI)
<SOLNBR>08-50
<RESPDATE>110308
<CONTACT>Lin A Jensen, Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 653-2488, Email lin.jensen@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC><p>
<p>Description / Purpose:</p>
<p>Background: The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW), Spacelift Range Group (LRRG), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California, is seeking to identify sources for Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) services. These LSI services shall be performed in various locations, to include Central &amp; Southern California, Florida, and Colorado. Work under the proposed effort is tentatively scheduled to commence in March 2009 and may continue for up to 4 years.<br />This Request For Information (RFI) for LRRG LSI services is distinct from the recently released LRSW RFI (solicitation number LRSW-SEI-08-29) for Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) services. There are two simultaneous RFIs, since the Government is investigating the feasibility and benefits of a separate, dedicated LSI for LRRG to improve Launch and Test Range System (LTRS) architecture and systems engineering, IAW OSD policy for LSIs (18 Jan 07). <br />If a contract is awarded for the LRRG LSI services, then the LRRG LSI awardee will face Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) issues that will likely preclude participation for any future contract(s) for LTRS modernization, modifications, and sustainment support. (Note: LRSW expects to release a future RFI for these functions in a follow-on LTRS integrated support contract during 2QTR, FY09.) Also, existing LTRS contractors face OCI issues with respect to being awarded the LRRG LSI contract. <br />Moreover, if the Government does not separate the LRRG LSI tasks from the LRSW SE&amp;I effort, then the OCI impacts would apply to the potential LRSW SE&amp;I awardee. In all three cases above OCI mitigation strategies must be addressed. LRRG requests interested, qualified sources to respond to this RFI. <br />Please be advised that the LRRG LSI RFI includes the following services/areas: LTRS Architecture Production; LTRS Roadmap Production; LTRS Systems Engineering and Integration; LTRS Configuration/Data Production &amp; Management; LTRS Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E); LTRS Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V); LTRS Systems Safety Engineering; LTRS Systems Security Engineering &amp; Information Assurance (DIACAP); LTRS Integrated Logistics Support; LTRS Integrated Master Schedule Production and Management, etc. <br />This is a request for information only and does not obligate the Government to reimburse any cost associated with preparation and/or submission of this information. Nor does the RFI guarantee the Government will issue your company a Request for Proposal (RFP) or award a contract for supplies or services. Instructions for submittals are provided below. The Government may use information submitted by respondents to this RFI to help assess the feasibility of an LRRG LSI acquisition, and to assist in developing a potential acquisition strategy.<br />LRRG's mission is to develop, acquire, deploy, modernize, upgrade, support and sustain the nation's premier Launch and Test Range System (LTRS). Deliver command and control, tracking, telemetry, communications and safety systems to support DoD, civil, and commercial space launch operations using responsive and effective spacelift capability, assuring continued access to space for the warfighter. The LTRS consists of the systems at Eastern Range, with its headquarters at Patrick AFB in Florida, and the systems at Western Range, with its headquarters at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The LTRS architecture is comprised of twelve (12) different intricate and complex subsystems, which function in concert to fulfill mission requirements for safely launching and providing telemetry information from all military, civil, and commercial spacelift vehicles/payloads. These 12 subsystems are: Command Destruct, Communications, Data Handling, Safety, Optics, Planning &amp; Scheduling, Radar, Surveillance, Timing &amp; Sequencing, Telemetry, Weather, and Simulators/Labs. <br />The LSI's role in the accomplishment of this mission will involve, but is not limited to, production of and/or implementation of LTRS architecture and engineering management plans, requirements analysis, engineering trade studies (including life cycle costs), interface control documents (ICDs), engineering management processes (including LTRS configuration management), spacelift range standards, risk management, engineering models, etc. to positively migrate the spacelift range enterprise in accordance with the vision and mission of the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) HQ. In addition to the above steady-state functions, LRRG leadership expects the most rigorous and disciplined engineering processes and LSI technical expertise (hardware and software) to immediately:<br />- Establish and maintain the LTRS baseline across ER and WR. This includes producing, updating, balancing, controlling, and tracing specifications, ICDs, performance metrics, etc., and all associated databases, to ensure the continuous professional integration of operational capability improvements and engineering changes to the LTRS program, over time. <br />- Formalize and manage the LTRS engineering change process and conduct detailed performance/schedule/risk impact analyses for all requests for changes (RFCs) to the LTRS baseline. (Cost impact analyses shall be coordinated with other Government sources.) Once the RFCs are approved by LTRS engineering boards, the Government shall pass the specifications to another contractor for design, production, implementation, and test. <br />The LSI shall professionally prepare, track, and communicate the technical status of all LTRS projects, in particular their compliance with the Government's functional and performance requirements and ICDs, and their technical (hardware and software) integration success into the LTRS. <br />The future US spacelift range environment is planning for several cultural and architectural changes. These dynamics, coupled with the complexity of the LTRS program, drive the need for a more robust approach to modernizing, developing, sustaining, decommissioning, and managing the current and future LTRS architecture to support all operational launch and test missions. The contemplated LSI contractor will provide LRRG with a proactive technical management approach to enable effective LTRS engineering and program execution. <br />Responses<br />Potential sources shall provide enough information in their Statement(s) of Capabilities (SOC) to demonstrate they have performed/supported systems engineering and integration contracts on DoD Range programs of similar complexity, have an understanding of LRRG mission and future technology challenges, and can provide the capabilities requested.<br />A minimum DoD security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort. Interested parties must submit an unclassified SOC along with supporting documents described below. Interested contractors should address potential Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) in their SOC(s) and, if possible, submit mitigation plans with their SOC(s). No real or perceived Organizational Conflict of Interest can exist (reference FAR 9.505-1). Additionally, if teaming with other contractors provide the name of the contractors. If a teaming agreement is in place please provide a copy of the agreement.&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The SOC(s) shall not exceed 50 total single-sided pages in length. All responses must conform to 8.5x11-inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point. (The mitigation plan, SOC cover page/ table of contents pages and any teaming agreements are not part of the Capability Statement and will not count against the page limit). This sources sought synopsis is for market research only, seeking qualified prime contractors. Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Interested parties shall state the size of their business. This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request For Proposal. Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any costs associated with submission of the SOC(s). <br />Submission Instructions: Submit SOC(s) in either PDF format or Microsoft Word format via 2 CDs and one hard copy to the Government Procurement Contracting Officer, Ms Lin Jensen: the Response Due Date is 3 November 2008, no later than 4:00 PM PST. The address is: <br />LRSW/PK, Attn: Ms Lin Jensen<br />483 N Aviation Blvd, Bldg 270 A2-462<br />El Segundo CA 90245<br />Questions: All communication associated with this RFI shall be submitted in writing to the Government Procurement Contracting Office via email. to: lin.jensen@losangeles.af.mil.</p>

<SUBJECT>Special Issue on Research Capacity and Infrastructure Development in Schools of Social Work
<SOLNBR>09-003SB
<RESPDATE>102708
<CONTACT>Sally Boakye, Phone 301-496-6546, Fax 301-402-0642, Email boakyes@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) intends to procure professional services on a sole source basis from the National Association of Social Workers.  The period of performance shall be for a period of 12 months 


Background  
The Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) furthers the mission of NIH by emphasizing the critical role that behavioral and social factors play in health, health care and well-being. OBSSR serves as the focal point for coordination and development of NIH policies, goals, and objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, and the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research.  OBSSRs vision is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve the pressing health challenges facing our nation. OBSSRs plan includes facilitating: (a) the next generation of basic behavioral and social science research; (b) transdisciplinary team science that integrates biomedical, behavioral and social-ecological perspectives; (c) research that integrates the systems and multiple levels of analysis  from cells to society  required to understand and model how individual, group, societal and contextual factors interact; and (d) the translation, implementation, dissemination and maintenance of best practices to strengthen the science of dissemination, put what is known into widespread practice, reduce the burden of chronic disease and help eliminate inequities in health and health care.

The OBSSR proposes to support and fund the development of a special issue of the journal Social Work Research (SWR) on advances in research infrastructure in social work.  This effort will promote research excellence and knowledge development and translation efforts in keeping with the recommendations outlined in the 2003 NIH Plan for Social Work Research (http://obssr.od.nih.gov/publications/swr_report.pdf). 


In 2003, under the direction of the OBSSR, the NIH created the NIH Plan for Social Work Research (http://obssr.od.nih.gov/publications/swr_report.pdf).  The NIH has continued to work diligently to address the recommendations set forth in that report. 

Considerable improvements in research capacity and infrastructure have been realized in schools of social work in the past 15 years. Investments by local universities and schools of social work, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and by groups such as the John A Hartford Foundation have enhanced knowledge development and increased research capacity in many social work programs. These and other investments have resulted in historic improvements in the scope and quality of social work research. Accomplishments to date include the enhancement of research portfolios in schools of social work; an increase in the number of NIH-funded social work investigators; the development of funded social work research centers and institutes; and expansion of interdisciplinary research in schools of social work. These advances have led to a wider dissemination of policy- and practice-relevant research and to an increase in the impact of social work research. 


STATEMENT OF WORK

Despite recent accomplishments, the current demand for evidence-based policy and practice heightens the need for an acceleration of research capacity in social work programs. Furthermore, a recent NIH program announcement that encourages proposals from schools of social work who have not received center or infrastructure grants suggests the need for an exchange of information about the most effective ways to increase research productivity. As part of this effort, Social Work Research is soliciting manuscripts for a special issue devoted to progress in developing research capacity and infrastructure in schools of social work. 

Possible topics include:
	lessons learned about enhancing research capacity and infrastructure from investments made by NIH, foundations, states, and universities
	strategic models aimed at improving research infrastructure that offer promise for replication across schools of social work 
	key practices, personnel, resources, and strategic supports that are necessary to develop robust research programs

The editors will consider papers from a variety of authors including principal investigators of NIH grants, centers, and infrastructure programs; investigators representing foundations, states, and other sources; deans, associate deans, and faculty of social work programs; university research administrators; and policy makers and practitioners.

Impact of the Special Issue

There have been considerable advances in social work research in the past several decades.  During this time, schools of social work have worked diligently to improve the supports necessary to foster rigorous scholarship.  The special issue aimed at research infrastructure will describe the efforts of national organizations, universities, and community partners to enhance research.

Funding for the special issue will make it possible to publish a double-issue of the journal devoted solely to the topic of infrastructure support.  It will also allow NASW Press to distribute the journal far beyond its normal circulation pattern.  Current plans call for distribution of the journal to all accredited schools of social work and to attendees of conferences such as Society for Social Work Research in 2009.  

Sole Source Justification

About Social Work Research

SWR is a quarterly academic journal committed to the dissemination of knowledge generated through empirical research.  The journal publishes peer-reviewed articles, topics devoted to measurement and instrument development, and research notes.  A wide range of topics pertinent to research in the health and behavioral sciences are published in each journal issue.  Manuscripts typically address the etiology, prevention, and treatment of individual and social problems in the context of mental health, health, substance abuse, and antisocial conduct (e.g., aggression, violence, crime, delinquency).  Manuscripts appearing in the journal also present findings from controlled investigations of interventions aimed at vulnerable populations using samples of high-risk children, youth, and families.  Publications also address issues associated with poverty, child welfare, and aging.  SWR is particularly noted for its interest in publishing empirical papers that use advanced analytical techniques to address complex etiological and intervention related questions.

The SWR journal which is managed by NASW Press is uniquely positioned and qualified to implement this project.  

All interested parties shall submit electronic responses to Sally Boakye at boakyes@mail.nih.gov.  Responses must be received no later than 12:00 PM local time prevailing on October 27, 2008.   Please reference solicitation number 09-003/SB on all correspondence to this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>Request for Information (RFI)
<p>Ground Instrumentation for Time and Space Position Information (TSPI) System</p>
<p>Schedule<br />Closing Date: 14 November 2008</p>
<p>Background <br />Currently the AFFTC does not have the capability for high accuracy tracking of non-cooperative test assets. Real time tracking, using range acquisition data or autonomous closed-loop data, is needed, including the capability of tracking two objects during separation events. The ground instrumentation sought would provide high resolution position data for post mission trajectory reconstruction of multiple non-cooperative objects associated with testing, for example munitions and parachute drops.</p>
<p>The AFFTC also needs the capability to provide ground instrumentation trajectory data, along with post mission derived velocity and attitude, to complement accurate TSPI results from test assets equipped with GPS TSPI instrumentation.</p>
<p>Scope<br />The AFFTC is seeking industry information on available products and technologies to further define/refine the requirements and the acquisition approach for the Ground Instrumentation Azimuth/elevation/range for Non-GPS TSPI (GIANT). Interested sources shall address their capability to provide accurate trajectory data to support TSPI missions for both non-cooperative and GPS instrumented test assets to reestablish high-accuracy TSPI capabilities formerly provided by Cinetheodolite devices. A TBD number of radar and/or optical instrumented sites will be implemented in a single or phased procurement. It is envisioned that the instrumentation will operate from prepared sites overlooking the various ranges on Edwards AFB. The sites will be equipped with power, concrete pads with anchor bolts, and fiber connection to a centralized control and data van, all provided by AFFTC. The system proposed must include a mobile or transportable capability to support autonomous but infrequent testing from unimproved sites within AFFTC test ranges.</p>
<p>The trajectory and raw measurement data, including optical and/or radar imagery data, produced by the proposed system will be used by AFFTC flight test programs in post flight analysis to produce refined TSPI results. A subset of the data will be provided in real time to support AFFTC situational awareness. Calibration, environmental and supporting setup data from the instrumentation will be applied in real time and/or post flight to produce high quality trajectory inputs for the for the final analysis steps.</p>
<p><br />Description<br />The key characteristics of the sought capability are contained in the table below. Note: &lsquo;threshold' indicates a basic requirement while &lsquo;objective' indicates a goal. Goals are not required but are considered very desirable. All requirements listed below are &lsquo;threshold' unless otherwise identified as an &lsquo;objective' requirement.</p>
<p><br />Characteristic Description<br />TSPI Accuracy 1) The trajectory results, after post mission analysis, from data merged from three instruments with similar measurement errors, obtained by

provide a net error less than + 1 meter (1 sigma, 3-axes) for absolute trajectory position.<br />2) The instrumentation shall be capable of high spatial resolution of multiple objects within the test scene, such as a 15 bomb cluster, to detect relative spacing, bomb orientation and spin characteristics (See FOV 1.).<br />3) The deliverable star calibration software and resulting data for each

<DESC><p>OFFADD: AFCA/EAC, 203 W. Losey St, Rm. 1100, Scott AFB IL 62225-5200<br />SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />DESC: This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis. Information obtained as a result of this synopsis is for planning purposes only. It does not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request for proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government. The government is currently conducting a market survey and analysis of government-off-the-shelf and commercial off the-shelf products that can meet the requirements for the vision of the Classification Management Tool (CMT).
<p>Sharing of information is critical to the defense of our nation. The DoD CIO stated in the DoD Information Sharing Strategy: "It is imperative to effectively exchange information among components, Federal agencies, coalition partners, foreign governments and international organizations as a critical element of our efforts to defend the nation and execute national strategy." Marking instructions, with appropriate declassification guidance, must therefore be current, accurate, and consistent with the Executive Order 12958, as amended. An enterprise classification marking tool for the Air Force is a critical step to share information by providing properly marked and formatted information in either email or document form. This tenet is a primary building block in sharing information from one security domain to another, e.g., NIPRNET to SIPRNET, or SIPRNET to coalition network (CENTRIXS) and is documented in the Functional Solutions Analysis (FSA) for Multinational Information Sharing (MNIS). The Controlled Access Program Coordination Office (CAPCO) standard is identified as a starting point for establishing an internationally accepted marking standard for information objects.</p>
<p>The vision of the CMT is to enable individuals to mark email and documents with little or no knowledge of regulatory marking standards. This capability would enable US and Non-US information sharing while allowing for future multi-level security technologies that rely on data tagging and document marking. Correct formatting of documents/email is critical in order to pass information from one security domain to another. Cross domain guards/rule sets may reject emails due to improper formatting. This tool would promote uniform, consistent, and comprehensive markings throughout AF while enforcing AF specific and CAPCO marking implementation guidelines. The tool would also protect information from potential unintentional declassification and/or distribution by ensuring classification banner/meta data accurately reflects the highest classification of a document denoted by portion markings and/or embedded data.<br />AF and CAPCO guidelines are very complex with many caveats. All documents/e-mails must include applicable header/footer banners, portion markings on paragraphs/e-mail subject lines, and declassification instructions. Declassification instructions, for example, come in two main forms which should be automated for the average user: originally and derivatively classified documents. An originally classified document has the "Classified By:", "Classification Reason:", and the "Declassify On:" instruction lines while a derivatively classified document only has "Derived From:" and "Declassify On:" lines. The resulting requirements are designed to fulfill this vision and, if followed, would yield the example below.<br />&emsp;</p>
<p><br />The product to provide the capability described by the CMT vision must satisfy the requirements (RQMT) in Appendix A which is primarily guided by the regulations in Appendix B. <br />All level 1 requirements (regardless of priority) must be successfully met prior to initial deployment, following the normal software development lifecycle process. Due to new regulations being published and current regulations being updated and/or refined, all other requirements are subject to change.</p>
<p>At a minimum, a vendor's RFI submission should answer the following questions:<br />1. How does the vendor's capability/concept support the CMT vision?<br />2. Can the vendor accurately relate customer definition of terms/concepts to vendor-specific solutions?<br />3. Does the proposed capability/concept rely on any proprietary standards to meet any of the requirements?<br />4. Does the solution meet the vision/requirements "as is" or is specific development required?<br />5. If development is required, is the vendor willing/able to accommodate an iterative process (e.g., the Unified Software Development Process) or does the vendor primarily utilize "waterfall" (AKA "all requirements first") approaches to software development?<br />6. How does the vendor deal with out-of-cycle requirements processing?<br />7. What is the timeline of completion, to include any development or deployment issues?<br />8. Does the vendor offer administrative/user support capabilities?<br />9. What are the expected cost breakdowns (e.g., development, licenses, "support" desk).<br />10. What warrants a version change over an interim change?<br />11. Does the vendor have any Microsoft Partnerships/Certifications?<br />12. Does the vendor's solution have any awards and/or relevant success stories/testimonials?</p>
<p>Vendors responding to the RFI who currently can make products available to the Air Force are requested to provide a description of capabilities NLT 30 days from publication of this notice. Potential vendors may express interest, make comments, and ask questions via electronic mail, phone call, or fax to the Air Force Communications Agency, Enterprise Architecture Planning at AFCA.EA.CSNI@scott.af.mil, (618) 229-6816, FAX (618) 229-5339. This includes requesting a copy of the one page drawing of an example marked document and listing of requirements.</p>
<p>Vendors that meet Air Force requirements will be allowed to schedule a demonstration, at no cost to the government, to highlight their product's capabilities and provide software/concepts for Air Force review. All comments and questions must be in writing and must identify the company source, contact person, e-mail address, and telephone number.<br />EMAILADD: AFCA.EA.CSNI@scott.af.mil<br />EMAILDESC: Air Force Communications Agency, Enterprise Architecture Planning, Scott AFB IL</p>

At the option of the Government, the SIR evaluation process may involve one-on-one discussions with one or more offerors, as determined necessary by the Contracting Officer, to clarify statements, resolve issues and omissions, etc.  The intent of these discussions is for the FAA evaluators (IPT) to gain a better understanding of the proposed project and/or to clarify evaluation information submitted by the offeror. All offerors which are eliminated from the competition will be notified in writing.
Written responses to this SIR are due by NOVEMBER 4, 2008 at 4:00 PM, local time.

Only emergency work to restore critical services to the facility will be considered and a moratorium waiver must be submitted and approved.  The moratorium period will not be counted against the contract construction duration for the project. 
The estimated contract value is from $2,500,000 to $7,500,000. The government contemplates award of a firm fixed price contract. The project is full and open competition not set-aside in any manner.
III.  Submission of Offer. An offeror shall submit an offer which shall include a Technical Proposal, 2 copies (see Item IV below for details).  It shall include:
  1.  Knowledge and experience of key project elements   2.  Past performance .  3.  Management approach resources and abilities  4.  Key Personnel Qualifications  5.  Financial resources and capability of prime contractor 
IV.  Evaluation Criteria.  For the purpose of screening which contractors will be given the opportunity to bid on the contract, proposals will be technically evaluated as either "acceptable" or "not acceptable" on the basis of the below criteria.  For the purposes of awarding the contract, the Government is seeking the best combination of technical attributes and price, and will consider strengths and weaknesses of the various "acceptable" technical proposals.  Thus, within the pool of technically acceptable contractors allowed to bid on the contract, a contractor with a stronger technical proposal and higher price may be awarded the contract over a contractor with a weaker technical proposal and lower price.  A prospective offeror must submit a complete technical proposal, which will encompass, but is not limited to, the content specified herein.  All technical proposal areas must be fully addressed.  A negative response is required in the event of no experience for a particular area, or for any item that is not applicable.  Any omission or partial and vague responses may lead to the rejection of the offeror's proposal without discussions with the offeror.  
Any proposal determined to be "not acceptable" in any evaluated area, criteria, or sub-element thereof, will render the entire proposal to be unacceptable and therefore rejected from further consideration. One-on-one discussions may be held, at the option of the Government, with one or more offerors, as determined necessary by the Contracting Officer, to clarify statements, resolve issues and omissions, etc.  The Government reserves the right to use and evaluate any and all available information pertinent to any offeror and its subcontractors, in addition to the data incorporated in the submitted technical and business proposals, and which may be related to performance periods beyond the last three (3) years.  
Criterion # 1. - Knowledge and experience of key projects elements.  Be specific and provide details to clearly support expertise and ability in each of the areas below. In the event that any area of expertise relates to a proposed or potential subcontractor, the company must be clearly identified.

This requirement is set-aside for small business concerns under the applicable NAICS code, 561110.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released fifteen (15) days after this synopsis publication.  No phone calls please, email questions to amcgee@cc.nih.gov.  

The Clinical Centers Medical Record Department (MRD) is responsible for providing transcription services for a variety of specialized medical reports related to patients inpatient hospital admissions, day hospital visits, outpatient clinic visits, ambulatory surgery and other complex diagnostic medical studies.  Such reports are categorized into four groups including medical reports, diagnostic reports, pathologic reports, and letters to outside physicians.

The NIH, CC, MRD is seeking a vendor to provide dictation, transcription, medical editing, and onsite management functions to support these services.  Dictation services shall be provided and supported by the contractor in such a manner to ensure the capability to receive, electronically log, store, and access all incoming dictation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year on a vendor-supplied NIH dedicated dictation system.  Transcription services for the majority of reports and letters will be conducted on the NIH-supplied 3M ChartScript.net transcription platform, with pathology transcription services provided through the NIH-supplied SCC SoftPath transcription platform module.

Phase I services will require that all dictation be accepted on a vendor supplied, NIH-dedicated dictation system, transcribed into 3Ms ChartScript.net transcription platform, reviewed and edited by a medical editor in ChartScript.net, and available for review by the NIH dictating clinicians within established turnaround times.  Phase II services will incorporate back-end speech recognition into the dictation/transcription process with implementation occurring over six to twelve months post award.  This process will require that dictation be accepted on a vendor supplied NIH-dedicated dictation system, the dictation uploaded to 3Ms back end speech recognition service (SyncStream), documents presented in 3Ms ChartScript.net transcription platform for editing by the vendor, and made available for review by the dictating clinicians within established turnaround times.

Additionally, the NIH, CC maintains strict controls over its information technology architecture and as such requires that all connections and data communications occur via an encrypted VPN connection.  Payment for services will be accomplished via a unit cost per line of transcription.  Following implementation of Phase II services, payment shall be structured utilizing a two-tiered pricing model enabling a separate cost per line for traditional transcription versus the cost per line for editing services following a pass-through the back-end speech recognition service.

The MRD will require the vendor to provide a full-time on site staff person to assist the medical staff with dictation/transcription services and liaison responsibilities.  All work must be based out of and completed within the United States, no overseas transcription/editing is permissible.  Additionally, a management representative shall be onsite regularly to communicate with MRD project officers regarding these services as well as coordinate activities through the initial architecture transition period.

To indicate capability of performing services outlined above, vendors must minimally provide information related to the following:  1) specific type of dictation system utilized/provided/supported; 2) specific transcription platforms and/or speech recognition software supported and utilized by the company; 3) qualifications of personnel to support on-site staff and management requirements; and 4) overview of information technology security architecture incorporated in the companys current structure.

<DESC>The DNDO has previously funded development of a variety of hardware platforms including Intelligent Personal Radiation Locators (IPRL). This prior funding has resulted in a significant improvement in detection by individual devices. In some use scenarios, several individual detectors may be used in relative close proximity.  Some examples could include maritime boarding parties, deployment for special events, and airports where detectors could be worn by multiple personnel as part of performing other duties or for rad/nuc searches.  
The DNDO is interested in leveraging the improvements of individual detectors by integrating information from multiple detectors. The DNDO is interested in building upon the current hardware detection programs and focus on the development of software and networks that take advantage of stand-alone, small form factor, and very capable sensors.  The networked system design should consider applications that can benefit from such a sensor system, in particular the maritime and air venues.  

This RFI seeks information on technologies and concepts for the network architecture and underlying algorithms that improve radiation detection/identification at the system level in anticipation of a DNDO sponsored Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) in the area of Intelligent Radiation Sensor Systems (IRSS). 

Responders should address hardware, software, and architectures that allow detectors to remain in contact with a central node and/or with each other, even in urban or maritime settings.  The system should be able to handle information from 2-20 devices with minimal impact on the battery life of the individual detectors.  Responders should describe advantageous ways to use data from multiple devices to improve the probability of detection, to improve location of detected sources and to improve the identification of a detected source.

Specifically, this RFI seeks information on relevant technologies, capabilities, and concepts in the following areas:

1.	Network Architecture: There are many ways to set up a wireless network of devices ranging from a traditional hub and spoke to an ad hoc, self-assembling network.  DNDO is seeking information on network architectures and hardware that would be most suitable for wireless networks of hand held radiation detectors consistent with use in maritime boarding parties and general aviation environments.
2.	Source Detection and Location: A key element of intercepting radiological threats is the rapid detection and location of the source.  DNDO seeks information on algorithms that would integrate data from multiple devices thereby improving the level of radiation required to detect the source and to more rapidly and accurately identify the location of the source.
3.	Source Identification: As the number of deployed radiation detectors increase, there is an increase demand for a smaller number of false alarms from any single device.  DNDO seeks methods that can use data from multiple devices to more rapidly and more accurately define the type of source that has been detected.  Areas of improvement should include the discrimination of threat sources from non-threat sources, such as naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) and medical isotopes
4.	Overall System Cost: A key element that may limit deployment of hand held radiation detectors is cost.  By integrating information from multiple devices, it may be possible to lower the cost of an individual detector and spread that cost over the entire system (rather than replicating that cost in every device).  DNDO is seeking methods of lowering the cost of a system of detectors through improved system performance and careful consideration of all elements of the system.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDERS

DNDO appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources, including but not limited to, National Laboratories, Federal Agencies, universities, university affiliated research centers, and private or public companies.

DNDO will schedule oral discussion sessions with interested respondents, after receipt of a written response, for further discussion and presentation.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement only.  This is not a solicitation and no contract will be awarded from this information.  No reimbursement will be made associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up requests.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  All responses must be in written format; no telephone calls will be accepted.
This sources sought synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted to determine potential sources capable of providing Sailors and Marines with Tactical Casualty Combat Care with Live Tissue Training (TCCC with LTT).  The applicable NAICS is 541711.
In preparation for a future procurement, the Regional Contracting Office, Northeast, Marine Corps Base (MCB), Quantico, VA  22134 is seeking the most effective and cost efficient manner possible to provide Sailors and Marines with LTT.  The government will examine two (2) possible Courses of Action (COA).  The first COA will examine contracting out the entirety of the TCCC with LTT for all contractors who provide proposals on the open contract. The government will evaluate curriculum cost data and estimates received for a complete TCCC with LTT course that includes classroom instruction and live tissue lab days.  The instruction period should be approximately five days in length, three classroom days and two live tissue lab days.  The first three days will teach the skills that are listed in the attached proposed requirement and the lab portion will give the students a chance to practice the skills that were taught in the previous three days.  The duration of this course should be five days; however, the contractor shall provide rationale for exceeding this objective. The second COA will examine military provision of the classroom portion of TCCC with LTT and contractor provision of the LTT laboratory portion.  The government will examine curriculum cost data and estimates received for live tissue lab days exclusively.  As indicated previously, the government anticipates two live tissue lab days.  The Marine Corps assumes that it will require TCCC with LTT training for a total of 1800 students annually in the vicinity of Field Medical Training Battalions East and West for the next five years.  Curriculum must comply with the SOW and its enclosures and instructions included in the attachment.  
In response to this sources sought synopsis a capability statement must be submitted that demonstrates extensive experience with, and ability to develop and perform the course described herein.  Responses must contain the following information:  (1) a one (1) page corporate summary including the contractors web site; (2) an extensive summary of the contractors relevant current and prior work experience to include resumes of trainers that exhibit a minimum of one year prior combat medical experience; (3) cost data responding to each above mentioned COA and curriculum requirements in the attachment; (4) description of any potential conflicts of interest the contractor may have in performing the work; (5) a brief description of the contractors qualify control processes for deliverables; (6) past performance information, to include contact information for similar work; and (7) a listing of any current negotiated GSA schedules, Government contracts, or commercial pricing schedules.
The Government will conduct market analysis by reviewing each contractors capability statement.  Any contractor should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the contractors qualifications to perform.
Government professional services contractor(s) may have access to data submitted in response to this synopsis.  Proprietary and confidential information will not be accepted.  The Government believes that standard specifications and capabilities should sufficient to respond.  If a contractor believes that their response must include proprietary or confidential information in order to be considered, their response must be properly annotated.

<DESC>USAID/Colombia intends to award a Sole Source Contract modification to Management Sciences for Development, Inc (MSD) under Contract No. 514-C-00-06-00304-00. The estimated amount of this modification is USD$2,517,000. The above Contract was awarded to MSD, Inc. on a full and open competition basis on August 29, 2006, and the estimated completion date is August 29, 2009.  The current total estimated contract amount is USD$26,419,765.  The purpose of the above contract is to provide technical assistance, training, and policy advice in support of human rights in Colombia. The purpose of this modification is to provide additional resources that will be applied to prevent, protect against, and improve responses to human rights violations.  Activities will strengthen the capacity of key independent oversight entities, including the Government of Colombias Human Rights Ombudsmans Office and the Office of the Inspector-General.  USAID will undertake various new initiatives to strengthen the capacity of both of these entities.  Illustrative activities include: training in human rights policy and international humanitarian law for staff of the Inspector-Generals Office; establishing official archives to document and preserve the truth and historical memory of human rights victims in Colombia; establishing a forensics laboratory within the Inspector Generals office to allow staff to better oversee investigations of human rights abuses and violations; and training and equipping staff in forensics investigation. Activities will also support civil society organizations to promote dialogue between civil society and the Ministry of Defense on human rights.  USAID intends to negotiate this modification with only one source under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70 (b)(5), where an award is for the continued provision of highly specialized services and award to another source would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable project delays. The required services include continuation and expansion of services of the same nature as described in the original statement of work of the original contract. This notice is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement in accordance with numbered note 22. Any information received will be considered for the purpose of conducting a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition is solely within the discretion of the Government.

SUPPORT INTEGRATOR (PSI)
PERFORMANCE BASED LOGISTICS (PBL) MARKET SURVEY FOR THE COUNTER RADIO CONTROLLED IED ELECTRONIC WARFARE (CREW) PROGRAM
Background: The USMC CREW program office has procured 10,089 CREW systems.  CREW systems are high power, modular, programmable, multiband radio frequency jammers designed to deny enemy use of selected portions of the radio frequency spectrum.  The USMC CREW systems, Hunter and Chameleon, are proprietary NDI systems.  The USMC CREW systems have been fielded in Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF), Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF), and as part of the USMC Maritime Expeditionary Units (MEU's).
Purpose: The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit interest in the conduct of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) for the USMC CREW Program.  Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is looking for potential sources to perform the role of Product Support Integrator (PSI) for USMC CREW systems.  In Accordance With (IAW) MCO 4000.57 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is the preferred support strategy for materiel systems. A PSI is an entity (i.e., individual, organization - public or private sector) charged with integrating all public and private support sources, defined within the scope of Performance Based Agreements (PBA), to achieve the documented performance outcomes.  The Marine Corps will implement the PSI  approach for fielded USMC CREW systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness; increased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deployment support; enhanced wartime support; reduction in the logistics footprint, ! and reduction in logistics costs. The selected PSI will be responsible for all or portions of the system supportability and logistics support, which could include, but is not limited to, system installation, supply chain management (spares support), field and sustainment level maintenance (scheduled and unscheduled), warranty tracking, data management, and operator and maintenance training.   Logistics support requirements are in CONUS and OCONUS locations.  Field Service Representative support and presence at OCONUS US CENTRAL COMMAND (CENTCOM) Area of Operation (AOR) is required.   System support processes will be transparent to the war fighter.   
Intent: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price Performance Fee Contract for up to six (6) years. 
Goals: Desired Results and Outcomes: Expected performance results from the PSI for the USMC CREW systems is achievement of efficiencies that reduce the logistics footprint; reduce logistics delay time, and reduce maintenance cost.  Ultimately the goal is the reduction of Operations and Sustainment (O&S) costs to the Marine Corps and increase mission availability.  
Measurements: Level of performance shall be expressed in measurable outcomes and achievement of those outcomes by objective evaluation. 
SURVEY QUESTIONAIRE FOR THE USMC CREW PRODUCT SUPPORT INTEGRATOR (PSI) FOR USMC CREW SYSTEMS 
The following will not be shared outside of the USMC CREW program office.
Name of Company: Address: City, State, Zip Code: Point of Contact (POC) information: Name: Telephone Number: Email Address: Website Address: What is the business of your company; i.e. large business, small business, 8 (a), etc. 
1. Describe your company's experience, if any, in providing PBL support to USMC , other DOD component/s, or industry.  2. Have you successfully performed in the role of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider on any other USMC,  other DoD, or industry system? If so, on which systems and what was the extent of the support provided? 3. If you have performed under a PBL contract in the past, what are some of the best practices you have used to be successful? 4. What would be your plan for managing the supply chain (parts support) for field (intermediate) and sustainment (depot) level maintenance?  5. What potential constraints and boundaries do you anticipate within the responsibilities of managing a PBL support contract? 6. How do you propose the government should measure the specific areas of performance metrics related to reducing the logistics footprint, reducing maintenance/repair times, increasing mission availability and reducing total logistics delay time? What recommendations can your organization provide? 7. What would be your plan for reducing maintenance/repair times for scheduled and unscheduled sustainment level maintenance?8.  Provide any other data deemed appropriate.

As an example, incumbent provides advice and technical leadership on strategic direction for national prevention activities, makes suggestions based on field visit observations and ensures that partners understand the importance of including behavioral approaches in their technical programs.<br />For national and international organizations: As a recognized expert, provides recommendations on the development of effective behavior-related prevention approaches, systems, methods and practices. Major decisions related to changes made by the MOH and other partners will be on the basis of advice, counsel and guidance provided by incumbent.</p>
<p>Incumbent interacts regularly with the PEPFAR Interagency Country Team to provide technical guidance, assistance and support on issues related to conduct of effective prevention, care and treatment activities. Incumbent provides valuable information needed for implementation and improvement of cooperative agreement programs. This support has a high level of impact on PEPFAR activities in Zambia.

This long-term effort requires the formulation of detailed proposals for the development or refinement of national surveillance policy and the development and dissemination of technical and administrative guidance documents. Incumbent is central to this effort and is required to monitor and evaluate progress, to make adjustments of project impact and outcome, and to carefully document the results. Incumbent makes recommendations regarding mechanisms and partners for COP planning regarding survey activities. Incumbent may recommend contracting short-term staff, where appropriate, for data entry or other activities related to surveys and surveillance.</p>

<p><br />Intellectual Skills:<br />Incumbent works in a highly detailed and complex information environment. Incumbent also must have strong knowledge, skills and abilities in the field of HIV/AIDS epidemiology and surveillance. Reporting guidelines are updated routinely and incumbent is expected to keep up with changes and communicate them to partners, as needed. Incumbent also is expected to stay current with developments in the field of HIV surveillance.</p>
<p>More generally, incumbent must know and understand specialized, technical public health information, including:<br />1. Policies on HIV surveillance at the international and national levels;<br />2. Guidelines, instructions, manuals and technical journals indicated for epidemiology and surveillance activities at national and project levels; and<br />3. Standard guidelines and instructions to develop and manage epidemiologic surveillance and survey protocols.</p>
<p>The work is highly complex, covering a multitude of projects undertaken by different implenting partners. For example, incumbent must be able to successfully balance differing perspectives from implementing partners while influencing the development of a comprehensive national surveillance system. The position requires in-depth bio-statistical analysis and determination of best options in order to meet organizational objectives. These analyses will be quantitative and qualitative in nature, as required for the annual and semi-annual reports, the Country Operational Plan (COP), UNAIDS surveillance, NIH and UNGASS reporting. <br />Problems encountered may vary significantly among the range of projects, and considerable judgment and analysis is required to reach appropriate resolutions. Incumbent must, for example, assist MOH, NAC, CSO and other partners who encounter difficulties collecting, sending or using data to support program surveillance activities.</p>
<p>Most common problems encountered: Determining options for collecting and organizing project data; partners that do not understand surveillance reporting requirements; clarifying reporting requirements; and collecting or filing data by a reporting deadline.</p>
<p>Most difficult problems encountered: Study design of surveys and program evaluation projects to ensure that a protocol meets CDC standards for ethical approval; developing long-term, sustainable capacity within partners to manage their surveillance systems, e.g., moving from PEPFAR-controlled to host nation-controlled and owned surveillance systems.</p>
<p>Detailed plans for project activities must be conceptualized well in advance while indicators must be developed to collect specific data from project activities before activities ever actually begin. This requires a great deal of forward planning and coordination with other PEPPFAR, MOH, NAC, CSO and other staff. Incumbent is a major contributor to the development of the COP with regard to surveillance and public health evaluation planning and is actively involved in the ongoing analysis and revision of the documents that outline program goals and objectives for the fiscal year. This entire process involves scheduling carefully and accurately for activities that will occur anywhere from one to three years in advance. Incumbent contributes to COP sections involving surveillance activities and also advises the PEPFAR senior technical staff on surveillance issues as they pertain to the development of long-term strategic planning documents.<br />Incumbent is expected to proactively seek opportunities for program improvements that may include the development and implementation of new or revised surveillance strategies and interventions. Incumbent is expected to keep abreast of new developments and innovations in the field; also is expected to contribute new ideas, and adapt techniques and procedures as required by CDC and PEPFAR. Innovations are particularly important with regard to the design and implementation of public health evaluations and national surveys in order to respond to changing indicator needs or logistical and ethical considerations emerging from CDC, PEPFAR, or UNAIDS.</p>
<p>Communications:<br />As technical lead on epidemiology and surveillance activities for CDC Zambia, incumbent communicates with a wide variety of people at many different levels (professional and political), both inside and outside of PEPFAR and CDC (e.g., national, provincial, district health agencies, international organizations, universities). Incumbent must provide consistent and credible representation of PEPFAR to MOH, donors, other partners and coordination bodies for epidemiology and surveillance technical, policy, and program evaluation and management issues. Has frequent contacts with both mid-level and high-ranking officials of MOH, NAC, CSO and other partners to define and/or reorient strategies, discuss changing surveillance needs, and translate policy into program action. Represents PEPFAR and CDC to multilateral donor coordination bodies in discussion of surveillance theory and techniques. Specific examples of the types of communication include:<br />1. With PEPFAR and CDC: Discusses Epidemiology and surveillance program planning and management activities and interpretation of results.<br />With MOH, NAC, CSO and staff of technical working groups: Provides technical assistance, detailed explanations and advice to support and train staff in the development of surveillance systems. Strong persuasive skills may be needed to convince high-level decision makers of the need for development and maintenance of dynamic and effective surveillance systems.</p>
<p>Routine transmission of information: with colleagues, partners, and contract staff to collect and verify information pertaining to surveillance program planning, implementation or evaluation <br />Tact and diplomacy: in frequent contact with senior and mid-level officials of MOH and collaborating institutions, such as national program directors and physicians, staff of local, central and international agencies, and NGOs. With counterparts at national level, to ensure good collaboration and understanding between PEPFAR and agencies to implement supported activities smoothly and in an efficient and constructive manner. <br />Complex explanations: to communicate highly complex procedures in the collection and processing of HIV/AIDS data to assure accurate results for analysis and decision making.<br />Formal training/teaching: acts as a trainer and/or faciliator in training courses on the use of new epidemiology and surveillance techniques. <br />Influencing/persuading: when working with MOH, NAC or CSO senior-level decision makers, to develop a national monitoring and evaluation system to standardize data collection techniques and processes nationwide.<br />Formal presentation/public speaking: with partners and among colleagues, as needed, for presenting or reviewing survey results. <br />Interviewing: when hiring staff for CDC team.<br />Leadership: to move peers and senior level MOH, NAC, CSO and partners, both at local and at international conferences and meetings, to adopt new and innovative epidemiology and surveillance concepts and interventions. <br />Must be able to clearly present technical procedure manuals and supporting documentation to support staff implementing, maintaining or evaluating surveillance systems. Incumbent must be able to communicate clearly in writing inasmuch as documents produced, e.g., PowerPoint presentations, abstracts, posters to national and international audiences or individual activity narratives within the annual COP, will define the issues, provide a clear background statement and discuss the rationale for the activity in a way that is understandable.</p>
<p>Working Environment:<br />The majority of the work is performed in an office environment, which is generally adequately lighted, heated or cooled, and ventilated. Approximately 20% of incumbent's time will be spent in a field setting inasmuch as this position requires regular visits to MOH, NAC, CSO and partner organizations, some in more remote project sites throughout Zambia.</p>
<p>Travel to project sites may expose incumbent to common hazards related to travel in the area, such as malaria, and traffic accidents, but none to which other CDC staff members are not subjected to as well.</p>
<p>Job is primarily sedentary, but may be somewhat stressful in terms of long hours, meetings in the evenings or weekend and work requiring short deadlines at times. Occasional fieldwork supervision may require visiting remote survey clusters on foot.<br />Incumbent may have to work outside official hours in order to meet deadlines, or for routine travel or work away from duty station</p>
<p><br />Other:<br />Incumbent is a high level public health professional who routinely conducts highly complex tasks or related activities with PEPFAR funded projects, and who provides expert level epidemiology and surveillance assistance to other external implementing partners.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking a contractor to provide a resource of preclinical and non-clinical services to advance the development of Topical microbicides (TM) and biomedical prevention (BP). There is a critical need to promote discovery and transition of new strategies into clinical trials. This NIAID-sponsored contract focuses on promoting the development of strategies containing TM/BP as a means to address the NIAID and Division of AIDS (DAIDS) priority of controlling and preventing the HIV/AIDS epidemic worldwide. This contract will provide pre-clinical and non-clinical development services of TM/BP products essential for advancement to clinical testing and for supporting activities required for IND and NDE applications to the FDA. TM/BP products for development services will be provided by or through the Project Officer and will be identified through NIAID-funded grants and contracts, the private sector, or other sources. The specific services required will depend on the status of the individual candidate(s), the need to prioritize potential candidates, and an overall product development plan and/or regulatory submission plan to the FDA. The scope of pre-clinical and non-clinical services to be provided include: (1) Individual gap-filling services on a case-by-case basis, to advance TM/BP products in the development pathway toward clinical assessment; (2) Comprehensive services for selected TM/BP products through a Go/No-Go milestone-driven pathway to accelerate a product toward clinical testing in the most efficient manner; and (3) Support for Best Practices Working Groups (BPWGs) composed of non-contract investigators to assess the critical processes and assays used to compare and advance products to clinical studies. This activity will ultimately lead to identification and validation of surrogate biomarkers for safety and efficacy testing in clinical trials. NIAID proposes to seek a deviation from FAR clauses 52.227-11 to restrict the Contractor's rights to subject inventions arising under any resultant contract. Furthermore, the timing of data publication would need to be restricted to allow adequate time for patent applications to be filed on inventions arising from the proposed contract. The NIAID intends to accomplish this restriction by a deviation from FAR clause 52.227-14, Rights in Data-General. The Government anticipates the potential need to exercise options for additional BPWGs during the life of the contract. It is estimated that up to four options for a total of 4 BPWGs will be exercised at the discretion of the Government during the period of the contract. These options may be exercised during contract years 2-7. The NIAID reserves the right to exercise more than one option per year, however, the total number of options will not exceed four during the 7-year period of the contract. The NAICS code is 541 & 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about October 17, 2008, and may be accessed through the Federal Business Opportunities at https://www.fbo.gov and the NIAID Office of Acquisition (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.

<DESC>DARPA is developing broad and diverse technologies necessary for external sensing deep inside buildings with the objective of providing a  suite of sensing technologies for situational awareness both above- and below-ground suitable across a broad range of building environments.  The component technologies must support all external ISR concepts of operations ranging from pre-mission planning through detailed assessment of targeted structures, and live updates during mission execution. 

The intent of this solicitation, DARPA-BAA-09-08, Harnessing Infrastructure for Building Reconnaissance, is to investigate individual technological approaches that leverage building infrastructure to opportunistically collect information for interior awareness. DARPA believes that opportunistic sensing may be exploited to infer urban interior building awareness using exterior observations. Specifically, DARPA asserts that: 

	The geometry and stimulus response of building infrastructure contains tactically useful information on the interior structure.  Infrastructure includes, but is not limited to, the structural, electrical, plumbing, and ventilation systems. 

	Such information may be acquired through access to the exterior of buildings which may include direct contact with an exterior umbilical, but does not require contact or deployments within the building. 

	Approaches to acquiring such information may require active as well as passive sensing.

	Multiple approaches may be required to provide complete building interior awareness. 

	A mission is expected to depend upon an optimal mix of technologies determined by the specific environment.  

DARPA is soliciting proposals to investigate and validate individual Sensing Technology concepts.  For purposes of this BAA, a Sensing Technology refers to an end-to-end process consisting of the signature of interest (related to a HIBR User Objective), the transducer technology (i.e., the coupling into the building infrastructure), the transmission path to the building exterior, the capture and interpretation of the signature, and the interface that displays the information to the user.

<CONTACT>Cassandra C Ellis, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-451-3691, Fax 301-480-4675, Email ellisca@niaid.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking a contractor to provide a resource of preclinical and non-clinical services to advance the development of Topical microbicides (TM) and biomedical prevention (BP).  There is a critical need to promote discovery and transition of new strategies into clinical trials.  This NIAID-sponsored contract focuses on promoting the development of strategies containing TM/BP as a means to address the NIAID and Division of AIDS (DAIDS) priority of controlling and preventing the HIV/AIDS epidemic worldwide.  This contract will provide pre-clinical and non-clinical development services of TM/BP products essential for advancement to clinical testing and for supporting activities required for IND and NDE applications to the FDA.  TM/BP products for development services will be provided by or through the Project Officer and will be identified through NIAID-funded grants and contracts, the private sector, or other sources.  The specific services required will depend on the status of the individual candidate(s), the need to prioritize potential candidates, and an overall product development plan and/or regulatory submission plan to the FDA.  The scope of pre-clinical and non-clinical services to be provided include: (1) Individual gap-filling services on a case-by-case basis, to advance TM/BP products in the development pathway toward clinical assessment; (2) Comprehensive services for selected TM/BP products through a Go/No-Go milestone-driven pathway to accelerate a product toward clinical testing in the most efficient manner; and (3) Support for Best Practices Working Groups (BPWGs) composed of non-contract investigators to assess the critical processes and assays used to compare and advance products to clinical studies.  This activity will ultimately lead to identification and validation of surrogate biomarkers for safety and efficacy testing in clinical trials.  NIAID proposes to seek a deviation from FAR clauses 52.227-11 to restrict the Contractor's rights to subject inventions arising under any resultant contract.  Furthermore, the timing of data publication would need to be restricted to allow adequate time for patent applications to be filed on inventions arising from the proposed contract.  The NIAID intends to accomplish this restriction by a deviation from FAR clause 52.227-14, Rights in Data-General.  The Government anticipates the potential need to exercise options for additional BPWGs during the life of the contract.  It is estimated that up to four options for a total of 4 BPWGs will be exercised at the discretion of the Government during the period of the contract.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request For Information (RFI) synopsis. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The following information is provided to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research to identify potential contractors to develop, test, integrate, produce, field and support Lighter Than Air (LTA) platforms/systems. Program Executive Officer, Strike Weapons and Unmanned Aviation (PEO (U&W)), PMA-262 (U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Persistent Maritime Unmanned Aircraft Systems) is the acquisition Program Manager for this potential effort. PMA-262 has recently been established and given the Navy charter to explore LTA free flight technologies in support of Navy missions. This RFI IS NOT for sensor/communication/weapon systems.

LTA Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) (optionally manned) have the potential to provide persistent Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Communications (ISRC) support as well as logistical support (manned) for tactical level maneuver/decisions and unit level low altitude air defense/force protection for Naval ships (multi-ship classes) and Marine Corps land forces. A notional ISRC system may include multiple air vehicles, one ground control station, multi-mission (plug & play) payloads, and associated launch, recovery, and support equipment with a 5,000 mi radius of action. A notional logistics system may include platforms with transglobal range (2,000 mi radius of action) and outsized payloads measuring up to 500 tons. These systems will support Naval missions such as building the Recognized Maritime Picture, Maritime Security Operations, Maritime Interdiction Operations, and support of Naval units operating from sea/shore in the global war on terrorism. The systems will also support Marine Corps missions such as close range UAS enabling enhanced decision-making and improved integration with ground schemes of maneuver. NAVAIR LTA interests include but are not limited to the following: conventional airships, hybrid airships, free floating balloon systems, and other High Altitude LTA systems. Additionally NAVAIR is interested in supportive LTA technologies to include but not limited to: buoyancy control systems, advanced/alternative propulsion/power generation systems, lightweight high strength envelope materials, vectored flight control systems, weather prediction/avoidance systems, lifting gas generation systems, unconventional landing schemes, ground handling, ship interface concepts, and LTA modeling/scaling methodologies. There are currently no Navy LTA CONOPS available for review. 

The following amplifying information is provided:

1) The sensor version has a
 
a. mission radius of 5000 nm
b. 2500 lbs payload threshold
c. un-manned semi-autonomous with remote pilot take off and landing
d. 16Kw power threshold
e. 7 days loiter at mission radius at 20,000 ft MSL is desired threshold.   

2) The logistics version would be manned and support for drive on  drive off cargo movement, operating from unprepared surfaces or from water (lakes, rivers open sea).

a. mission radius of 1000 nm
b. optionally manned
c. up to 500 tons
d. aircraft cargo movement should be compatible with Navy ship operations.
e. carrier take off and landing is not required. 

3) The aircraft should be designed for fielding near term with first flight in 28 months.  

4) Operational Concept of Operation requires the landing area at the radius of action will use only indigenous support services.  

5) The aircraft must be able to take off and land from water, snow, sand, and from un-prepared fields with up to a 1.5 degree slope. 

The development of this aircraft should use OEM airworthy systems where possible. 

Recommendations: 
Industry responses should provide a general description of the aircraft for the proposed solution.  These data should include:

1) General description of the aircraft and subsystems
2) Notational propulsion and control concepts
3) Concept of Operations, take off, landing, command and control.
4) Systems support requirements
5) Design materials and other technologies needed.
6) Identification of high risk development components and long lead components 
7) Design and sizing attributes that permit the Technology Demonstrator to be scaled for useful payloads to 500 tons
8) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) levels of each system
9) Time line to develop to first flight
10)Technologies that contractor has already risk mitigated

a. Notational risk reduction and verification plan
b. Notational R&M 
c. Notational cost per ton per mile for cargo mission

<DESC><p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development ORD) has participated in the Department of Energy's (DOE) Oak Ridge Institute of Science and Education (ORISE) Research Participation Program (RPP) through a series of Economy Act Interagency Agreements since the 1970's. The ORISE RPP is administered by Oak Ridge Associated Universities, a contractor to DOE. For more information on the DOE ORISE RPP, go to http://www.orau.gov/orise/educ.htm. Pursuant to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Guidance entitled, "Improving the Management and Use of Interagency Acquisitions," which was issued in June 2008, and to the provisions of FAR Part 17.5, the EPA must conduct a market survey prior to entering into a follow-on interagency agreement with DOE to determine if there are comparable programs in the commercial sector that could provide the same or similar services to EPA as conveniently and/or economically as the DOE ORISE program. <br />The purpose of this synopsis is to conduct a market search for businesses or other organizations with demonstrated experience in administering a program that recruits and administers the work of graduate students, post-doctoral students, or university faculty from a broad range of scientific disciplines to provide research services on a subcontract or other basis. Such businesses or other entities should submit capability statements outlining their technical, managerial, and recruitment capabilities, and business classification, for the following proposed effort. (To be considered a small business, this procurement will utilize NAICS code 541612" with a size standard of $7M. The information submitted will be evaluated and used to determine whether or not this procurement, in whole or in part, may be fulfilled most effectively and efficiently to the Government under a contractual arrangement, and if so, whether a small business set-aside is appropriate.) The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park NC intends to award an interagency agreement or contract for the services of an organization that can recruit qualified graduate and post-doctoral students and university faculty from a broad range of scientific disciplines to provide direct research services, performed at possibly any location of the EPA's Office of Research and Development. This organization must also handle the personnel administration of the selected individuals, as these individuals do not become EPA employees, rather are in a contractual or other relationship with the recruitment/administration organization. Based on receipt of EPA's particular research requirements, the organization will recruit candidates, coordinate review of those candidate's capabilities with EPA, and select the most qualified candidate(s). Post-selection, the organization will handle personnel administration, including payment, of the selectee, who performs the research work at an EPA facility or other approved site. Only statements that clearly detail your experience and capability to perform the requirements of this announcement will be considered. All capability statements are due by 3:00 p.m. ET on November 14, 2008. You may submit any questions to the attention of Morrison.mcdonald@epa.gov. Please submit your capability statement directly to Morrison.mcdonald@epa.gov, or if submitting your information via the US Postal Service, please use the following address: US Environmental Protection Agency, Attention: McDonald Morrison, RTP Procurement Operations Division (E105 02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

<DESC>The purpose of amendment no 2 is to clarify and incorporate the following questions and answers to this A-E 8(a)solicitation. Question no 1: Specifically in the description of services to be procured (Fedbizopps) it stated that "each completed drawing and specification must undergo a bid ability and constructability review certified by a professional construction engineer with 20 or more years experience in construction".  Is the professional construction engineer required to be a team member, or are the services to be provided by a consultant contracted whenever required, using the standard procedures for sub-contracting consultants?
Government response to question no 1: A professional construction engineer with 20 or more years is required to be a team member.

Question no 2: How is "professional construction engineer" defined?  to the best of may knowledge, that particular title is not recognized in Puerto Rico for the purposes of licenses, as opposed to the PE title that refers to an engineer who is duly-licensed to practice engineering in Puerto Rico.  There is no such requirement in order to be a general construction engineer in Puerto Rico.  Therefore, could those requirement be filled instead by a licensed professional engineer who has at least twenty years of construction experience.

Government response to question no 2: Yes, the requirement could be filled by a licensed professional engineer who has at least twenty years of construction experience.

Procurement continue to be set-aside for 8(a) certified SBA Business Development Program for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individuals.  

The services still required will be predominately Mechanical/Electrical Design with Architectural and Structural Supporting Services, in nature. Everything else referenced in the initial announcement and amendment no 1 shall remain the same and in full force. 

The closing date has been changed from August 21st, 2006 to August 28th, 2006. 

Three copies of the submissions shall be placed in a sealed envelope clearly identified and appropriately marked as follows:  Solicitation No. GS-2P-06-PC-D-0072, Predominately Mechanical/Electrical Design with Architectural/Structural Supporting Services, for projects located in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, Closing Date: August 28, 2006.

Government response to question no 1: A professional construction engineer with 20 or more years is required to be a team member.

Question no 2: How is "professional construction engineer" defined?  to the best of may knowledge, that particular title is not recognized in Puerto Rico for the purposes of licenses, as opposed to the PE title that refers to an engineer who is duly-licensed to practice engineering in Puerto Rico.  There is no such requirement in order to be a general construction engineer in Puerto Rico.  Therefore, could those requirement be filled instead by a licensed professional engineer who has at least twenty years of construction experience.

Government response to question no 2: Yes, the requirement could be filled by a licensed professional engineer who has at least twenty years of construction experience.

Procurement continue to be set-aside for 8(a) certified SBA Business Development Program for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individuals.

<DESC>The Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L, LCMC)Acquisition Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for The Rapid Response (R2) Acquisition Thrust. The R2 is the major part of a Command Pilot Program to increase the Armament, Research, Development and Engineering (ARDEC) responsiveness to meeting its customers immediate requirements. In support of the Global War on Terror (GWOT), ARDECs mission, including lethality and counter-lethality efforts has expanded to include providing expedited developmental solutions to meet the customers needs at various stages of the lifecycle of a product. Historically, research and development was allowed years to develop and integrate solutions into weapons systems. Todays reality requires ARDEC to provide working lethality and counter-lethality solutions as quickly as possible. In many instances, solutions need to be provided within weeks from receiving a requirement or no more than one year.
This R2 effort will provide a responsive contracting vehicle to meet these surge and/or specialized requirements. The use of a broad scope Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with multiple prime contractor awards to maintain competition is expected to provide the flexibility and responsiveness required to meet current Army mission requirements.
This competitive acquisition is intended for multiple award contracts as a result of the Request for Proposal (RFP) (W15QKN-08-R-8403). An integrated assessment will be made by the Source Selection Authority (SSA) from the results of the evaluation factors and sub-factors as set forth in Section M. Multiple awards will be made based on the best overall proposals that represent the best value to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the Offerors Technical, Management, Task Order 1 and Delivery Order 1, Past Performance, Small Disadvantaged Business Participation and Price/Cost. Pre-award surveys may be conducted. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest price offeror or to other than the offeror with the highest color rating if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.
After contract award, individual Task/Delivery Orders will be competed amongst the multiple awardees under each respective contract utilizing fair opportunity procedures in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1). The Government will put forth a Letter of Contemplation and the Contractors will have five working days to respond. Proposals will be evaluated using an integrated assessment of schedule, cost and performance. The Government will evaluate the responses over a period of seven working days and then a period of five working days will be used to negotiate between the Government and the contractor (as required) and then award the task (seventeen working days in total is the goal for Task/Delivery Order award).
A non-disclosure agreement will be required to be signed by the offeror(s) receiving an award. The Government intends to award this contract on a best value basis using Full and Open Competition. It is anticipated that the IDIQ will have duration of five years. 
It is anticipated this solicitation will be posted on the US Army JM&L, LCMC Procurement Network website located at http://procnet.pica.army.mil. This is not an RFP; the RFP will be issued on or about July 14, 2008. The deadline for all proposals will be 45 days after issuance of the RFP.
Questions shall be submitted to U.S. Army JM&L, LCMC, Attn: Margaret B. Reed, Contract Specialist, AMSML-AQ-SP, Building 322, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, Email: margaret.b.reed@us.army.mil.
