<CONTACT>Maria S Shamburger, Email HEG9@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NCIRD/ISD, 1600 Clifton Rd. NE, Mailstop A19, Atlanta, GA, 30333, hereby announces its intent to issue a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to GlaxoSmithKline, Three Franklin Plaza, Philadelphia, PA 19101 to store and rotate pediatric vaccines in a national pediatric stockpile for use in the event of a disease outbreak or vaccine shortage. The period of performance for this acquistion will be a base period of 12 months with four 12 month option periods.
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." As the manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline is the only vendor with a market large enough to rotate older stockpiled vaccines into operating inventory before expiration and replace them in order to maintain a viable stockpile. Contracting with the manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, to store and rotate these stockpiled vaccines is the only alternative to keep CDC's purchased vaccines viable for use year after year, and maintain the stockpile in the most effective and efficient manner possible. Recent market research on manufacturer specific vaccines revealed multiple distributors capable of storing stockpile vaccines but none capable of rotating the vaccines. Without the capability for an organization to rotate the vaccines into the market and then replace those rotated vaccines with fresh vaccines, it could not most efficiently and effectively manage CDC's pediatric vaccine stockpile program. GlaxoSmithKline is the only company which has exclusive capabilities to store and rotate their own vaccines without the Government having to make additional purchases.</p>
<p><br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Please forward the capability statement and/or pricing information to Maria Shamburger, Contracting Specialist, Reference 2013-53211, Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, ATTN: Maria Shamburger, MS: K14, 2920 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341. All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, negotiations will be conducted with the GlaxoSmithKline as the only source and a contract will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $12M.</p>
<p>Period of performance is for twelve months from time of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is conducting a study to evaluate whether the community of bacteria that resides in the colon (the microbiota) affects the risk for breast cancer. The gut microbiota is essential for human health and are postulated to play important roles in various human malignancies. Previous NCI research has shown that the diversity and certain enzymatic functions of the fecal microbiota are associated with systemic levels of estrogens. Higher estrogen level is a significant risk factor for breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women. Identifying the contribution of the gut microbiota to estrogen level could lead to better ways to identify women at highest risk and potentially to microbes or microbial targets for intervention.<br />The contractor will recruit sixty (60) newly diagnosed, untreated women with breast cancer, ages 55-69. To serve as controls for these breast cancer cases, the contractor also will re-contract and re-enroll as many women as possible who participated in NCI protocol 11-C-N235 "BRANCH: Fecal Microbiota Among Participants in a Pre-paid Health Plan" (minimum n=58 who provided all data and specimens, maximum n=77 who agreed to participate but did not complete all procedures).</p>
<p>Each case and control woman will provide informed consent to participate in the study, questionnaire data focused on breast cancer risk, four aliquots of a stool specimen (using collection devices and reagents provided by NCI), and a spot urine specimen. The participants will freeze the specimens in their home freezers. The contractor will pick up the specimens, transport them on dry ice, temporarily store them frozen in a local repository, and deliver them via overnight carrier as a batch on dry ice to the NCI repository in Frederick, MD. The specimens will be delivered in one batch within two weeks of completion of the collection.</p>
<p>The contractor will assemble and deliver to NCI a data set with the questionnaire and clinical data from each case and control participant.</p>
<p>Kaiser Permanente of Colorado (KPCO) is uniquely qualified and located to provide this service. NCI will be collecting the specimens and data from breast cancer cases and controls, under a rigorously controlled protocol (11-C-N235). KPCO is the only organization with the proven ability to perform all steps required for the successful completion of the protocol. Thus, KPCO is the only qualified vendor.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on December 10, 2012. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Erin Breedlove, Contract Specialist at breeerin@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-130013-EB on all correspondence.</p>

In turn, NRL maintains a Military Support Division (MSD), Code 1400, that ensures military and contractor personnel are available to meet project requirements.

<CONTACT>Olessya Oliyarnik

<a href="mailto:ooliyarnik@usaid.gov">Acquisition Specialist</a>
<DESC>USAID/CAR Regional Mission intends to issue a solicitation to qualified offerors for the Quality Reading Project (QRP) to be implemented in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, a 4-year project to improve reading levels among students in grades 1-4 in both countries.  The project will focus on improved reading instruction; issues related to the availability of reading materials; increased out-of-school reading time; and increased government support to improve reading.
In Tajikistan, activities will complement the USAID Country Offices Feed the Future strategy. USAID anticipates that Khatlon Region (25 districts) will be the initial focus region and will then expand to Sughd Region (18 districts).   The Region of Republican Subordination will be the last targeted region, following discussions with the ministry to ensure access to selected rural areas.  
In Kyrgyzstan, Chui, Batken, and Issyk Kul Regions are intended as the initial focus regions and the project will then expand activities to Naryn Region followed by Talas, Osh, and Jalal-Abad Regions.
Based on the 2010-2011 academic year, Tajikistans national data estimated that 668,675 students were enrolled in grades 1-4. The regional breakdown is approximately as follows: 264,158 in Khatlon, 218,358 in Sughd, 164,570 in RRP, and 21,589 in GBAO. USAID estimates that a minimum of 60 percent of primary students in the targeted regions (i.e., Khatlon, Sughd, and RRP) can be directly reached during implementation of the project.  Among Kyrgyzstans total estimated primary student population of 400,000, USAID estimates that more than 60 percent can be directly reached. The primary languages of instruction for this project are Kyrgyz, Tajik, and Russian. The project will work with teacher-training institutes (at the national and regional levels), DED methodological units, and schools that have previously received donor assistance, including through USAID projects, as well as schools and communities that have not received previous donor assistance. Anticipated activities may include: 
a) Design an in-service training package b) Conduct in-service trainings for teachers and other educators c) Strengthen systems for teacher mentoring/coaching d) Implement classroom-based reading diagnostics (process focused) e) Build capacity to administer national, standardized reading assessments (outcome focused) f) Conduct a review of the quantity of primary grade reading material available in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan g) Ensure a mix of reading materials are used by schools and communities h) Increase public awareness about the importance of reading as a cornerstone of education and life-long success i) Implement out-of-school reading activities j) Increase Ministry dialogue about the existing environment for reading acquisition k) Increase Ministry capacity to develop and conduct large-scale assessments l) Strengthen the enabling environment to support improved reading instruction reform.

<DESC>The Department of Defense's (DoD) Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) requests proposals to perform fundamental ecological research on estuarine, coastal, and associated terrestrial ecosystems that are necessary to sustain military readiness.  The desired outcome of the requested research is to: (1) understand the effects of military activities and infrastructure on these ecosystems and (2) support their sustainable and adaptive management.   This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare DoD SERDP's intent to competitively fund research and development that provide novel research perspectives as described in the Program Announcement.<br><br>The Defense Coastal/Estuarine Research Program (DCERP) is an existing program that involves the execution of ecological research within the context of military land and other resource use.  DCERP has been executed since late 2006 at Marine Corp Base (MCB) Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.  The extant program has collected extensive ecological data and improved our basic understanding of many of MCB Camp Lejeune's ecosystems.  This call for research proposals is intended to fund a new DCERP effort for a period of five years and also provide new thematic directions to guide the research effort.  <br><br>The Program Announcement and complete submittal instructions are found on the DoD SERDP web site at http://www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/SERDP-Solicitations/Resource-Conservation-Special-Solicitation.  <br><br>To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a proposal in accordance with all instructions on the SERDP web site no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Time on Thursday, January 5, 2012.    <br><br>No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made.  Awards may take the form of contracts, grants or cooperative agreements.  Submission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  The government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan.<br>There is no commitment by SERDP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any money expended by the offeror before contract award is made for a demonstration.  It is expected that one award totaling approximately $10.0 million will be made, dependent on receipt of proposals that appropriately address the issue.  <br><br>Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the government goal is that Small and Disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority Institutions participation represents 5 percent of the total contract value.  Offerors are required to complete a Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) and include it in the proposal.  Both large and small vendors must submit SBPP to receive maximum credit.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 and 541330 with the small business size standard of 500 employees.  In addition, proposals selected for funding that exceed $650,000 submitted by all but small business concerns will require a Small Business Subcontracting Plan (SBSC) in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  The HECSA Small Business Office web site at www.hecsa.usace.army.mil/hxsb provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate.  The SBPP and SBSC are two different requirements.<br><br>The point of contact for procedural questions in the SERDP Office is Ms. Jina Banks-Saunders, 703-696-2127.  For technical information regarding this announcement, contact Dr. John Hall at John.Hall@osd.mil or 703-696-2125.<br><br>The HECSA point of contact for non-technical contracting issues is Mrs. Susan Hill, Susan.M.Hill@usace.army.mil or telephone at 703-428-6420 and for the subcontracting plan is Jackie Robinson-Burnette, Jackie.L.Robinson-Burnette@usace.army.mil or telephone at 202-761-8789.  <br>

To ensure that Sensitive Information is protected, the Government adheres to Department of Defense Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) (DoDI 5200.4).  The Government adheres to the National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation process (NIACAP) for all Federal Departments and agencies.  Typically a service provider must demonstrate past performance of the deployment of a global IP VSAT architecture that included an Authority to Connect (ATO) to a DISN Leading Edge Services (LES) without waiver and DISN Security Accreditation Working Group (DSAWG) Authority To Operate (ATO) on SIPRNET.  In addition to the above, the implementation of Department of the Army Regulations such as the Army Regulation 25-2, November 14, 2003, Information Assurance (AR 25-2) will augment the requirements of the DITSCAP.  This includes a capability to support Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES).

Proactive monitoring of the network must include a staffed Network Operations Security Center (NOSC). The contractor will also be responsible for operating a reactive trouble management and help desk capability. This capability will be a facility that provides full time (24x7x365) reactive trouble management and help desk functions. The contractor will manage this capability as a single point of contact tier 1 and tier 2 customer care and technical support staff operation. In order to be considered the contractor must provide technical, operational and support staff with current active secret or top secret clearances. <br>  <br> The contractor must be capable of providing both network services and user services.  Network services shall include satellite reach back, LMR, cellular, wired and wireless Ethernet and radio gateway. User services shall include SVoiP, VoIP, VTC, email, chat, white boarding, common operating picture (COP), incident command system, web portal and directory services.   <br>  <br> The period of performance is expected to be a five (5) year Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract.          <br>  <br> In conjunction with the above referenced services, the Government anticipates outleasing facility space pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C.   2667. This facility space would be used to house contractor equipment which will be required for the provision of services. <br>  <br> Firms capable of performing the described services are invited to submit a description of their capabilities and experience in writing.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  It is neither a solicitation announcement nor a request for proposals or quotes and does not obligate the Government to award a contract. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. Responses to this Sources Sought must be in writing. The purpose of this Sources Sought Announcement is for market research to make appropriate acquisition decisions and to gain knowledge of potential qualified businesses interested and capable of performing the work. Responses to this notice shall include the following: (a) company name  b) address (c) point of contact (d) phone, fax, and email (e) DUNS number (f) Cage Code  (g) Tax ID Number (h) Type of small business, e.g. Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, SBA Certified 8(a) Firm, SBA Certified HUBZone Firm, Women Owned Small Business, SBA Certified Small Disadvantaged Business, Small Business, or Other than Small Business, and (i) must  provide a capability statement that addresses the organizations qualifications and ability to perform as a contractor for the work described below.    

Description: The Northport VA Medical Center has a need to purchase a Pneumatic Tourniquet specifically for Orthopedic and Podiatry procedures performed in the operating room. The use of said tourniquet is indicated to temporally occlude blood flow in a patient's extremities during surgical procedures on those extremities.  Tourniquets are widely used in orthopedic, plastic and podiatry surgery, as well as in intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier block anesthesia) where they serve the additional function of preventing local anesthetic in the limb from entering general circulations. Modern automatic tourniquets are self-calibrating and self-contained. New tourniquet devices also provide a variety of safety features that are not possible in older mechanical tourniquets.

The A.T.S. 3000 Automatic Tourniquet System is a dual-port, dual-cuff medical tourniquet system with microprocessor controls and dedicated ports for supplying and measuring  pressure independently. With the innovative Limb Occlusion Pressure (LOP) feature, the A.T.S. 3000 Tourniquet combines the latest in advanced surgical tourniquet technology with the well-established Zimmer tradition of safety, reliability and convenience. It offers a Self Check Calibration feature which automatically checks the accuracy of the machine calibration each time the unit is powered on, saving time. A cuff alert option is standard that alerts user of cuff status when attempt is made to set the machine to stand-by.

	 The A.T.S. 3000 Automatic Tourniquet System also features prompts the user to confirm the deflation command during bilateral or IVRA procedure to reduce complications due to sudden cuff deflation. A Four-Hour Battery Backup maintains pressure if AC power is temporarily lost and the color-coded cuffs range from 8 inches to 42 inches to accommodate virtually all patients and limbs. The unit has a carrying handle which makes it easy to transport, and includes pull-out hangers for storage of cuffs and hoses. 
	
	The lightweight, portable unit can be mounted on an IV pole or placed on a table. The A.T.S. 3000 offers LOP technology that senses, calculates and reports the cuff pressure necessary to achieve complete blood occlusion in the operative limb. The LOP sensor is applied to the index finger or second toe of the patient's operative limb prior to surgical prep and provides a Recommended Tourniquet Pressure (RTP) setting in approximately 30 seconds. The physician will have the option of accepting or rejecting the RTP provided by the tourniquet system based on the physician's independent clinical judgment. The ability to provide a specific RTP for each patient based on physiological characteristics makes the A.T.S. 3000 truly unique. The A.T.S. 3000 Automatic Tourniquet System can be operated with or without the use of the LOP function. 

 The Government is not obligated to nor will it pay for or reimburse any costs associated with responding to this sources sought synopsis request. This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. The Government will in no way be bound to this information if any solicitation is issued.

Description: The Northport VA Medical Center, 79 Middleville Road, Northport, NY 11768 has a need for Recreation Bus Transportation for Fiscal Year 2013 (October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013).

Recreation Therapy Service provides comprehensive therapeutic recreation, leisure education, self-directed activities and voluntary services to individuals with physical, social, cognitive or emotional limitations and abilities.  The primary purpose of treatment services, often referred to as recreation therapy, is to restore, remediate or rehabilitate in order to improve functioning and independence.  Recreation Therapy may also reduce or eliminate the effects of illness and disability.  The primary purpose of self-directed recreation services is to provide recreation resources and opportunities in order to improve health and well-being and foster independence.

Recreation Therapy Service implements community re-integration for therapeutic and social activities to enhance their quality of life by reducing social isolation, providing and/or improving the general health and well-being by offering opportunities to attend community based events, functions, therapeutic outlets and sporting events.

Community re-integration destinations may include trips to the beaches on Long Island; the World Trade Center Site and Memorial; luncheons and dinners at local restaurants and invitations from Veteran Service Organizations; trips to museums; art exhibitions, botanical gardens, and historical sites to name a few.

For small community trips that require transportation for ambulatory patients, Recreation Therapy Service uses government motor pool passenger vans.  In addition, a fifteen passenger wheelchair bus is designated for those with limited mobility and who require a wheelchair for ambulation.  The current vehicle serves up to five wheelchairs and a small number of ambulatory patients.  Trips with less than five non-ambulatory patients are handled using this vehicle. Reliance on these resources has limited the number of patients attending, thus reducing quality of life for those who were unable to go resulting in an increase in complaints while decreasing the customer satisfaction rate.  

Vendor must have the capabilities of providing transportation for both our ambulatory and wheelchair transportation with the capabilities of small and large buses.  

The scope of work covered is approximately 38 trips to be implemented during  FY 2013 which have a larger attendance than can be managed with on-station vehicles and drivers.  In order to determine the trips we examined trips that have taken place over the last two years.

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

"	Provide one wheelchair van suitable for carrying wheelchair bound patients for 13 trips during FY13.
"	Provide one large bus (44 passenger) for 10 trips during FY13.
"	Provide one mini bus for 15 trips during FY13.
"	Provide this transportation on notice ranging from several weeks to only 2-3 days.
"	Provide vehicles sufficient to carry the number of ambulatory or wheelchair Veterans specified at the time of the request to the contractor.

      (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25.  For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.
  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin

    (2) __ Outside the United States.
  (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
    [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--
      (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;
      (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003- 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and
      (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.
    [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003- 4(d)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--

      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
  (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
    (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
    (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).  If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.
    (3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).
      [  ] TIN:  _____________________.
      [  ] TIN has been applied for.
      [  ] TIN is not required because:

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>Background:<br />Federal Occupational Health (FOH) is the largest provider of occupational health and wellness services to the Federal government. Located within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), FOH's mission is to improve the health, safety, and productivity of our Federal employees. We strive to accomplish our mission by delivering comprehensive occupational health and wellness solutions to more than 360 Federal agencies, reaching more than 1.8 million Federal employees. FOH's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and Work/Life services are available to Federal employees and their families stationed in over 100 countries around the globe. FOH also currently operates Occupational Health Centers, On-site Health and Wellness Centers, Wellness/Fitness Centers, Industrial Hygiene and Environmental Health Laboratories. In addition, we maintain an extensive network of occupational health providers, affiliate medical providers, a nationwide network of licensed mental health counselors, and environmental health professionals.</p>
<p>FOH is planning to adopt a customer - centric workflow using a web-based occupational health and safety system that includes an integrated electronic health record (EHR) to facilitate collection and management of health data in order to improve outcomes at both the individual and population levels. This EHR will also enable the tracking of employee's fitness for duty, maintain required physical qualifications, assess the effectiveness of integrated occupational health, wellness and other health promotion efforts, and advance standardization and collaboration between FOH divisions and their staff. The system will include a web-based patient portal for appointment scheduling, survey completion including a Health Risk Assessment (HRA) and will provide an employee access to their health record. Because FOH is a fee-for-service organization, the system will support the life-cycle of inter-agency service agreements and the fees associated with each service item.</p>
<p>Please Note:<br />The system must meet the standards and certification criteria adopted by the Secretary of HHS. Therefore, the system MUST be certified by one of the organizations selected by the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) as an Authorized Testing and Certification Body (ATCB) with a scope of authorization that includes "Complete EHR and EHR Modules". The complete list of current ONC-ATCBs can be found at http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&amp;mode=2&amp;objID=3120.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives:<br />FOH seeks information on available commercial products to support the implementation of a web-based enterprise level occupational health, safety and wellness solution to improve the delivery of FOH programs and preventive healthcare services. This system will provide a mechanism to track services including, but not limited to in-service physical examinations, preventive screenings, injury/illness investigations, medical and occupational health surveillance programs, employee counseling services, Law Enforcement Medical Programs, respirator equipment monitoring/fit testing, health risk assessment (HRA) data, and exposure monitoring to support FOH's clients. It will also be able to generate reports that utilize a variety of metrics to establish: <br />1. The cost effectiveness of these programs <br />2. Delineate where further targeted interventions/follow-up are indicated <br />3. Compare the results among various sites or between one or more agencies.</p>
<p>This system will also support the needs of FOH's Environment Health, Industrial Hygiene, and Employee Assistance Program (EAP). It will be able to support the business life-cycle of FOH services including the management of inter-agency service agreements, service catalog, work orders, fee for service billing and tracking as well as the fulfillment of the work orders issued for individual agencies. As the intention of the system is to be customer-centric, a web-based patient portal is a key component of the system.</p>
<p><br />Project Requirements:<br />The system will need to support a number of critical FOH requirements, including, but not limited to:<br />1. An occupational health and safety system with an integrated Electronic Health Record - Maintains and tracks medical information generated through a number of locations, programs, and services, including:<br />o FOH Occupational Health Centers and other outside medical facilities caring for FOH patients<br />o Occupational Medical Services including: 1.Pre-placement exams, 2. periodic medical exams, 3.fitness for duty exams, and 4. work related injury care<br />o Biometrics, lab and EKG data<br />o Medical Clearance for Law Enforcement and other Programs <br />o Medical Surveillance <br />o Medical Employability (requests for reasonable accommodation, family and medical leave act) <br />o Immunizations<br />o Health Education and Promotion participation and utilization<br />o Inventory management for Automated External Defibrillators (AED) spirometry, audiometry or other health equipment requiring periodic certification, calibration or testing <br />o Wellness/Fitness utilization data<br />o Health risk assessment (HRA) data<br />o Environmental, industrial hygiene, and health and safety consultations and services<br />o Employee Assistance Program (EAP) participation and utilization<br />o Referrals - within FOH and to outside providers<br />o Respirator medical clearance / training<br />o Encounters / utilization to support reporting and analysis<br />o Online appointment scheduling <br />o Automated Letter/report generation for medical opinions/recommendations<br />o Medical supply inventory/tracking<br />o Pharmaceutical supply inventory tracking <br />2.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The Federal Government intends to enter into a lease renewal for a period of five (5) years firm for approximately 19,969 rentable square feet (RSF) of office and related space. The Government presently occupies 19,969 RSF at Pierpont Professional Building, 604 Cheat Road, Morgantown, West Virginia which expires June 4, 2013 under GSA lease number GS-03B-02357. The Government has determined for mission-related and economic reasons that it is advantageous to renew its current lease.</span></p>

<DESC>SLAC's location is 2575 Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, CA 94025. PEP stands for the Positron-Electron-Project, a high-energy physics research, approximately one mile in circumference, particle accelerator. PEP contained two rings in a common, underground tunnel to collide electrons which were accelerated in the HER ring and positrons which were accelerated in the LER ring. SLAC decommissioned PEP in 2008. SLAC is currently dismantling the facility to prepare the infrastructure for a potential future accelerator.

Funding for this Performance Work Statement (PWS) will be provided through the USACE Collaborative Program and USACE project funds.   <br>  <br> Proposed project will be a competitive, firm-fixed price contract procured in accordance with FAR 15, Negotiated Procurement using  quote mark Best Value quote mark  trade-off process.  The results and analysis of the market research will finalize the determination of procurement method.  The type of set-aside decision(s) to be issued will depend upon the responses to this synopsis. <br>   <br> The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of industry, to include the Small Business Community: Small Business, Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUB-Zone), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsible contractors. <br>  <br> The Government is seeking qualified, experienced sources capable of performing the following: <br>  <br> A. Background  The Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Collaborative Program (Program), using U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) Program funds, executed a contract in FY2011 for the development of an adaptive management (AM) Plan.  Version 1 of the AM Plan was delivered to the Program in October 2011 (http://www.mrgesa.com/Default.aspx?tabid=460).  The successful offeror will continue to develop, refine, and implement AM throughout the Program using Version 1 of the AM Plan as a template.   <br>  <br> Adaptive management (AM) is a rigorous approach for designing and implementing management actions affecting the natural and human environments, which intend to maximize learning about critical uncertainties that affect decisions, while simultaneously striving to meet multiple management objectives.  It involves synthesizing existing knowledge and identifying critical uncertainties, developing scientific hypotheses related to those critical uncertainties, and exploring alternative management actions to test those hypotheses. These management actions will include  explicit predictions of their outcomes including level of risk involved with implementation.  Finally, science-based monitoring and research will be conducted to see if the actual outcomes match those predicted, and then these results will be used to learn and adjust future management and policy.   <br>  <br> B.  Work to be Performed.  Building on Version 1 of the AM Plan, the contractor will add on to the existing plan by developing the  quote mark Priority Projects and Processes quote mark  of AM.  Tasks would include: a) work with the Program to establish a Policy Group and a science-based Technical Group to work on the AM, b) develop an updated list of critical uncertainties and scientific hypotheses generated by the Program, based on those developed in Version 1 of the AM Plan (including  a 2-day workshop to discuss findings with Program members), c) develop a list of the 'top five priority AM actions' that could be pursued by the Program and develop a plan for implementing, monitoring and evaluating those AM actions, d) develop a Strategic Program AM Guide, and e) develop an AM Tracking Tool that documents evaluation criteria in order to document success and develop management decisions. This Tool will be part of the Program's Database Management System (http://mrgescp.dbstephens.com/#Home). These tasks would take place over a 2-year period. <br>  <br> Estimated duration of the project is 2 years. <br>  <br> Minimum capabilities required include:  <br> 1) 5 years minimum experience with 'adaptive management' of ecological resources <br> 2) Key Personnel working on this project should have at least 5 years experience and a Master's Degree (preferred) in the fields of ecological, biological, or environmental science. Key Personnel should have the following expertise: <br> a. Project Management <br> b.

Experience in southwest river systems and related T&E species.  <br> d. Experience managing adaptive management of ecological resource policy and technical meetings with diverse stakeholders <br>  <br> 3) At least 3 examples (within the past 5 years) of projects similar to the work and scale to be done on this project.  <br>  <br> The North American Industry Classification System code for this procurement is 541620 which has a small business size standard of $14,000,000.  The Standard Industrial Code is 8742.   <br>  <br> Small Businesses are reminded under FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting that they must perform at least 50% of the cost of the contract with their own employees.  <br>  <br> Prior Government contract work is not required for submitting a response under this sources sought synopsis. <br>  <br> Anticipated solicitation issuance date is on or about January 4, 2013 and the estimated proposal due date will be on or about February 4, 2013.

<DESC>INVITATION FOR OFFER  FEDERAL NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS IFO NO.  BLM-2013-CHEU-001 January 2013 through December 2013
Introduction The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Amarillo Field Office (AmFO), Department of Interior (DOI) requests written offers to purchase Federal Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) produced from the Cliffside Helium Enrichment Unit (CHEU).  The BLMs CHEU is located in Potter County, Texas, near the city of Amarillo.
The BLM seeks to enter a NGL transportation and sales agreement for NGL volumes that will be advertised and renewed annually.  The NGL will be available at the tailgate of the Cliffside Helium Extraction unit.  The BLM will produce helium and natural gas in a combined stream from the Bush Dome Helium Storage Reservoir in Potter County, Texas, and separate the products at the CHEU.  The reservoir is about 15 miles northwest of Amarillo, Texas.  The BLM will store the NGL on site for pick up via truck transport by the successful bidder of this agreement.  Buyer is responsible for all transportation costs.  The BLM estimates the NGL volumes from CHEU will average 1,000 to 3,000 gallons per day, and will remain relatively steady through the 6- to 7-year life of this project.  Pricing of NGL will be based upon current market values tied to a common spot market (such as Conway, Kansas NGL Trading Hub) and the quality of the NGL.  The NGL at the pickup point is a non-fractionated liquid byproduct.  To acquire the full details for applying go to: http://www.blm.gov/nm/amarillo

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> This contract is for a non-personal service in support of US Army Military Religious Programs. The Contractor must be committed to working within the pluralistic Military Chapel environment, in cooperation with other congregational leaders to meet the needs of the congregation. As a non-personal services contractor, the Catholic Religious Education Coordinator is not a member of the Chapel or Installation Chaplain's Office Staff. The contractor and all employees shall identify themselves as contractor personnel by introducing themselves or being introduced as contractor personnel and displaying distinguishing badges or other visible identification for meetings with Government personnel. The Contractor shall appropriately identify themselves as contractor employees in telephone conversations and in formal and informal written correspondence. <br>  <br> The mission of the Chaplain's program is to provide for Essential Elements of Religion to include worship services for all assigned soldiers, civilians, and family members. The primary goal of the religious education program is to provide basic religious understanding through Bible studies, doctrinal studies and life application studies for children, youth and adults within the garrison. All aspects of the religious education program shall remain the responsibility of the Commander and shall be conducted under the supervision of the USAG chaplain. The USAG chaplain will designate a chaplain or chaplains to supervise all chapel religious education programs. The USAG Director or Religious Education (DRE) will advise the chaplain and will provide guidance and direction for program design, curriculum selection, volunteer training and program administration... As such, they fall under the responsibilities of all Chaplains and, here in particular, the Catholic Community Chaplain. The Catholic Religious Education Coordinator falls under the USAG Baumholder Chaplain's Program.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation/Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NIAID-NOI-13C-1613419 a Notice of Intent. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-62 dated November 20, 2012. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business set-aside, however small disadvantage, minority, veteran owned, and HUB zone companies, etc., are encourage in submitting a proposal. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516, which has a business size standard of 500 employees. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) intends to procure high throughput lasers as a sole source requirement from Becton, Dickinson, and Company (BD Biosciences). See the attached list of lasers that will be used for replacement lasers in five (5) flow cytometers already located in the lab for the period of one (1) year. The five (5) flow cytometer instruments are in constant use up to 7 days a week and the lasers are critical for the optimal functioning of the instruments. Without the lasers, these instruments are rendered non-functional. Samples that are tested are run through the instrument labeled with specific fluorescent antibodies that only emit a signal when hit with a certain wavelength of light emitted from the each of the lasers (red, blue, violet and green). During routine maintenance, these lasers are checked for power and signal strength and any that are suboptimal are replaced. These lasers are also replaced if they malfunction between routine maintenance. As these instruments are custom designed for the needs of the lab, the lasers that are an integral part of the instrument are designed such that they will work only with the customized instruments. There is no known lasers offered that will physically fit inside the instruments to provide the optimal signal strength and power to accommodate the functioning of the instrument. To use a different vendor for these lasers will cause the instruments to not be able to be calibrated to optimal specifications such that samples between experiments will not be able to be analyzed and compared. This would adversely affect the function of the lab and its mission. Period of Performance is one year from date of award to the location of Bethesda, Maryland 20892. The award will be based on: 1) the capability to meet the required specifications, 2) price, and 3) delivery. The FOB terms are "Destination" and Net 30.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. <br />"Registered in the CCR database" means that- <br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14) into the CCR database; and <br />(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process. <br />(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. <br />(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. <br />(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. <br />(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- <br />(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or <br />(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. <br />(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: <br />(i) Company legal business. <br />(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. <br />(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and ZIP Code. <br />(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and ZIP Code (if separate from physical). <br />(v) Company Telephone Number. <br />(vi) Date the company was started. <br />(vii) Number of employees at your location. <br />(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. <br />(ix) Line of business (industry). <br />(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). <br />(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. <br />(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. <br />(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(g) <br />(1) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of clause) <br />52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. <br />As prescribed in 17.208(g), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: <br />OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000) <br />(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within _____60 days provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least _____ 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. <br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. <br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed __3 years.

The responsible Contractor and subcontractor are liable for unpaid wages if they violate the terms in paragraph (a) of this clause. In addition, the Contractor and subcontractor are liable for liquidated damages payable to the Government. The Contracting Officer will assess liquidated damages at the rate of $10 per affected employee for each calendar day on which the employer required or permitted the employee to work in excess of the standard workweek of 40 hours without paying overtime wages required by the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act. <br />(c) Withholding for unpaid wages and liquidated damages. The Contracting Officer will withhold from payments due under the contract sufficient funds required to satisfy any Contractor or subcontractor liabilities for unpaid wages and liquidated damages. If amounts withheld under the contract are insufficient to satisfy Contractor or subcontractor liabilities, the Contracting Officer will withhold payments from other Federal or federally assisted contracts held by the same Contractor that are subject to the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act. <br />(d) Payrolls and basic records. <br />(1) The Contractor and its subcontractors shall maintain payrolls and basic payroll records for all laborers and mechanics working on the contract during the contract and shall make them available to the Government until 3 years after contract completion.

STATEMENT OF WORK:  
1. The nursing home shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA Beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA patients will be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) will include the cost of medical care, oral medications, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.
2.  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.
3.  Absences of the patient from the nursing home in excess of 48 hours will not be reimbursable.
4.  Patients, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.  When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
5.  In the event a VA beneficiary receiving nursing home care under this contract dies, the nursing home will promptly notify the VA facility authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by the VA patients upon the premises of the nursing home shall be delivered by the nursing home to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the nursing home for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs, or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with annotation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA facility authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient leave no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust.  In these cases the nursing home will forward an inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA facility authorizing admission and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.
6.  The nursing home shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities, which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.  The nursing home shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom.  The term facilities shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, entrances, and other like areas.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well being of the patient is rendered.
7.  Veterans receiving care under this agreement, who begin to require acute hospital care, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by the VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained as soon as possible and not to exceed 72 hours of admission to the non-Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA facility will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
8.  If a veteran is re-hospitalized from the nursing home, the nursing home and VA facility will arrange to hold a bed in reserve, when such a decision is in the best interest of the patient and the VA.  The number of covered bed hold days will be determined by VA on a case-by-case basis, but will not exceed the number of bed hold days allowed by state Medicaid regulations.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  The VA facility will include payment for these "bed hold" days only when the conditions above are met.
9.  The VA facility will approve leave days (days away from the nursing home) for long-term placements.  The leave must be part of a therapeutic plan and approved by VA.  Leave days at VA expense are limited to 6 days per calendar year.  Payment will follow state Medicaid regulations.  Exceptions may be approved by the VA facility director or designee.
10.  Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, will be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non Federal facility may be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization must be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.
11.  It is agreed that VA will have the right to on-site reviews of the nursing home and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well-being of the patient is rendered.
12.  The nursing home shall provide all services specified herein, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered.  In addition, the nursing home warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.
13.  It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back into the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute nor relieve the nursing home in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.
14.  All medical records concerning the veteran's care in the nursing home will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the nursing home for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).

16.  The contract for the affected patient will terminate whenever a VA patient is rehospitalized for fifteen (15) calendar days or more, whether in a VA or in a non-Federal facility.  A new authorization agreement and contract will be considered at the time the patient returns.
17.  The level of care classification and associated per diem rate will remain in effect for each placement until and unless one of the following events takes place: (a) The recipient is discharged and subsequently qualifies for a new admission assessment, (b)The nursing home's Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment will be completed at customary times during a patient's stay, dependent on projection for short term or long term residence, and adhering to the most current MDS frequency guidelines from Medicare MDS or BRA or MPAF.  The applicable per diem rate will continue until the next assessment. In addition, assessment will be made eight (8) days after the completion of an episode of authorized rehabilitation therapy, after a rehospitalization, after a significant change in status and at VA's request.  Classification changes will be approved by VA. VA staff will audit approximately 20% of the MDS assessments.  Based on these findings, VA retains the right to remove the automatic applicability of the nursing home generated MDS assessment for payment purposes, and (c) Therapy Requirements - All therapy provided under this contract will be individual therapy, rather than group therapy, unless otherwise ordered by the authorizing VA facility.  NOTE: Prior to starting a therapy program, facility must obtain VA pre-authorization.
18.  The VA, at its sole option, will monitor the professional care and administrative management of services provided to VA beneficiaries under this agreement, through one or any combination of the following methods; reviews of state agencies reports, on-site inspection of the Nursing Home by VA staff, and/or on-site monitoring of VA patients.  It is agreed that the Nursing Home shall provide VA with copies of all state agency reports when requested, and cooperate fully with VA's quality improvement-quality assurance program functions relating to this agreement, including VA's on-site inspection and monitoring.   The VA Contracting Officer shall make all final determinations as to the contractor's reasonable cooperation with VA and compliance with these requirements.
SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: (1) TERMINATION OF SERVICES:  VA reserves the right to remove any or all VA patients from the nursing home at any time, when it is determined to be in the best interest of the VA or the patients, without additional costs to the Government (2) EXTENSION OF AGREEMENT:  This agreement may be extended for four (4) one year periods at the option of the Government in accordance with 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.  Notice of an extension must be served in writing by the Government thirty days prior to the scheduled expiration date.  The extension is granted subject to the availability of funds, (3) MINIMUM QUANTITIES:  It is impossible to determine the exact or estimated amount, which will be expended under this agreement.  No obligation will be incurred by VA under this agreement, until authorizations are issued for nursing home care of specific beneficiaries.  VA agrees to make payment on a timely basis for services rendered in accordance with such authorizations upon receipt of proper invoices submitted by the nursing home as outlined in this agreement.  VA will make payment for the day a recipient enters the facility but not the day the recipient leaves a facility unless entrance and departure are on the same day, then payment will be made for one day, (4) LIFE SAFETY CODE CLAUSE:  The administrator of your facility is required to notify the VA Contracting Officer at least 3 days prior to any planned facility changes that could impact the Life Safety Code and other safety features of the facility, which were in existence at the time this contract was issued.  The VA Contracting Officer will notify the VA Fire Safety Officer responsible for the Life Safety Code inspection of your facility and he/she will review (inspect the facility if required) the proposed changes and provide necessary approval/disapproval of your facility to house veterans during and/or after the proposed changes.

The assigned nursing home physician is the primary doctor during the nursing home stay and is responsible for writing or approving admission and all other orders as soon as the veteran arrives at the community nursing home.  The community nursing home physician is responsible for general medical care, urgent evaluation and intervention.  Physician visits will be according to medical assistance guidelines.  The assigned nursing home physician will provide timely care following the most current CMS guidelines; arranging 24/7 access for patient care, easy access to staff for consultation, provide timely response to calls and arrange for timely physician back-up according to OBRA guidelines (Ref. 42 CFR 483.40 OBRA Guidelines), (6) In emergencies, nursing home staff will utilize the 911 local emergency systems as for any resident; advance directives/living wills shall be considered according to nursing home doctor's orders.  When private hospitalization or emergency services are required, the patient, spouse, financial guardian, or insurer is financially responsible.  Service connected veterans may qualify for VA coverage of emergency care provided the VAMC is contacted by the private hospital physician within 72 hours of admission.  This includes the cost of necessary transportation for such care, (7) VA MEDICAL CENTER CONSULTATION/RESOURCES: (a)  Telephone Care Communications System (TCCS):  For urgent-same day outpatient specialty care or for non-urgent scheduled clinic appointments/consultations, phone 605-336-3230 x6181 between 9AM and 3PM Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.

This constitutes double billing and Federal fraud, (9) The VAMC will pay two-day bed hold for therapeutic passes or re-hospitalization; for longer periods the family must make arrangements with the contract facility to hold a bed.  Reimbursement for all bed holds will be 70% of the prevailing per diem rate.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Middle East (ME) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader, and is based in Beirut, Lebanon as the senior OTI representative in the country.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Lebanon country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>OTI initiated the Lebanon Civic Support Initiative (LCSI) in January 2010 to support U.S. foreign policy objectives aimed at promoting peace and stability in Lebanon. The program focuses on youth, who are often involved in conflict but also offer the best potential as proponents of peace and agents of change. Through small grants and short-term technical assistance, OTI works with a wide range of civil society partners to foster leadership and advocacy skills among youth, provide alternatives to political extremism, and create independent space for constructive civic activism.  LCSI has recently expanded programming in northern Lebanon, increasing the number of vocational trainings and community projects and events, and working in two areas that are seeing increasing tensions as a result of the spillover effects from the Syrian unrest.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire one Country Representative to work for OTI in Lebanon.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Country Representative requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The Country Representative is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Country Representative is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The Country Representative has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Middle East (ME), the Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.  When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs, where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, mentor and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff, providing regular feedback;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner's scope to OTI's country objectives, partner's budgets, and modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the ADS (USAID's Automated Directives System);</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other pertinent agencies and organizations.  Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with them in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government, as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g.  Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Admin Assistants, etc.).  Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests; and,</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Country Representative will report to OTI's Washington-based Team Leader Middle East (ME), or his/her designee, as well as to the Lebanon Mission Director.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position for the OTI Lebanon program, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes.  Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the Supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS<br />The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>While in Lebanon, the work is generally performed in an office environment.  However, the position also requires travel throughout host country, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<DESC>ART IN ARCHITECTURE PROJECT<br />GSA Synopsis for Artist Services<br />Artist Services Synopsis Number:  GS-09P-13-KT-C-0003
<p><br />FBO Classification:  R499<br />NAICS:  711510</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) Art in Architecture Program commissions American artists (citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents or Permanent Workers of the United States) to create publicly scaled and permanently installed artworks for federal buildings nationwide.</p>
<p>GSA announces an opportunity for a federal art commission in conjunction with the new construction of U.S. Courthouse in Los Angeles, CA.</p>
<p>This project provides for the construction of a new courthouse in downtown Los Angeles, CA. The site/design and construction prospectus will be designed to meet the amended 30-year requirements of the U.S. District Courts and related agencies with the initial build-out to house the 10-year housing requirements.  The Project involves the design and construction of an approximately 600,000 gross square foot courthouse, including 110 controlled-access indoor parking spaces, in Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p>This Project is an opportunity in design and construction excellence. GSA intends to build a new United States Courthouse that shall be a focus of pride for the community it serves, as well as the nation. The Project shall be a functional, innovative, sustainable, cost-effective, state-of-the-art, court facility that will contribute to the overall design quality of downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p>GSA generally allocates one-half of one percent of the estimated construction costs for new or modernized federal buildings for art commissions.  The art budget for the new U.S. Courthouse project is currently estimated to be $1,500,000.  One or more artists will be awarded a fixed-price contract for a commission.</p>
<p>Artists who wish to be considered for this and all future GSA art commissions must submit application materials to GSA's National Artist Registry (Registry).  The Registry constitutes the qualified list of artists for this and all GSA commissions.  Instructions on how to join the Registry are available on the following Web site:</p>
<p>www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture</p>
<p>All artists who wish to be considered as candidates for a commission at the U.S. Courthouse in Los Angeles, CA, must have their application materials submitted and received by GSA by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on December 28, 2012. &nbsp;Artists' submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for this project, but will be eligible for consideration on future GSA commissions alongside the other artists on the Registry.  Artists already on the Registry need not resubmit, but may elect to update their information prior to the deadline.  If any technical questions arise regarding this posting please contact Mr. William Caine, Art in Architecture Program, Office of the Chief Architect at william.caine@gsa.gov or 202.501.4271.</p>
<p>GSA evaluates artists based on the following criteria: the media, materials, content, style, and scope of the artist's past work, along with the artist's past performance and experience with commissions or projects similar to the one described in this synopsis.  Short-listed artists will be contacted and asked to submit additional information including a price proposal for the contemplated project.  GSA has determined that the combined weight of all the technical selection criteria is significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the scope of services for this commission will require: collaboration with the lead designer selected for the building project; development of preliminary and final concepts; fabrication of the artwork; participation in meetings and conservation reviews as necessary; and the installation of the artwork at the project site.</p>

If necessary, as pre-coordinated with the points of contact listed at paragraph (xv) the Government will provide a representative to meet the offeror at the gate to the installation to accept the proposal submission. Furthermore, the U.S. Forces conduct random exercises which may require the closure of the main entrance gate and the utilization of an alternate base entry.

<p>(End of Addendum) <br />(ix) FAR Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items (Jan 1999), applies to this acquisition. The specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of the provision are Price, Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement, past performance. Basis for contract award: low price technical acceptable with acceptable performance confidence. Initially offers shall be ranked according to price, lowest to highest. Technical evaluation shall then be performed on the lowest priced offer and subsequently the performance confidence evaluation shall be performed if the technical evaluation result is an "acceptable" assessment. If the lowest priced offer has an evaluated "acceptable" rating for the Technical factor and an Acceptable Performance Confidence, award will be made to that firm and the evaluation process will stop at that point. If instead the low priced offer has not been assessed an "acceptable" rating for the technical factor or an acceptable assessment for performance confidence, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have an "acceptable" Technical factor rating and an Acceptable Performance Confidence or until all offerors are evaluated. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:<br />a. Price. The offer will be evaluated on the total price of all Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINS) contained in the schedule. Failure to include all prices may exclude the offeror from further consideration for award, as the Government may award without discussions. However, the Government does reserve the right to conduct discussions. The standard for price is met when the price is determined fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>b. Technical Evaluation. Technical evaluation shall be on an acceptable/unacceptable basis, determined based on submittal of acceptable documentation, certifications and past experience using the ratings listed below:<br />Acceptable: Offer clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable: Offer does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. The offeror will be evaluated on the subfactors listed below and the standard is met when the following valid documentation is included in the offer evidence that the offeror is technically capable to successfully provide required items: <br />(i). Certificate of enrollment with the Chamber of Commerce providing the authority of the firm to produce requested items and operate in the specific business sector of the instant solicitation. The documentation must not be older than 90 calendar days from date of offer; <br />(ii). Technical data sheet(s) of proposed products including compliance with current norms and CE certification requirements.<br />(iii) Location of asphalt mixing plant. <br />(iv) Certifications of asphalt mixing plant <br />c. Performance Confidence - Past performance shall be evaluated to determine the offeror's performance confidence as either acceptable or unacceptable: Acceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. Unacceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offerors will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />The basis for the performance confidence evaluation shall be contractor-provided evidence of performance of contracts for work which is similar in type, scope, magnitude and complexity to the work described in this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to seek past performance information from other sources, such as the Contractor Performance Assessment Report System (CPARS). Any additional information will be evaluated in the same manner as offeror supplied references.<br />The Government will rate the offerors performance confidence as follows:<br />(a) Acceptable: The contractor has provided evidence, in the form of two (2) references, of successful contract performance within the last&nbsp;2 years from the date of the release of the subject solicitation where the Offeror is/was responsible for performing work similar in type, scope, magnitude and complexity to the work described in this solicitation. Information gained from the references and/or information obtained by the Government from other sources reveals acceptable performance.<br />(b) Unacceptable: (i) The offeror has failed to provide evidence, in the form of two (2) references, of successful contract performance within the last&nbsp;2 years from the date of the release of the subject solicitation where the Offeror is/was responsible for performing work similar in type, scope, magnitude and complexity to the work described in this solicitation. The information gained from the references and/or information obtained by the Government from other sources reveals unacceptable performance. The Contractor was given the opportunity to address negative past performance information by the pertinent assessing official and the unacceptable rating was confirmed. In the event the Offeror was not given the opportunity to address the negative past performance information the Government shall afford the offeror an opportunity to address such information prior to assigning a rating for the instant solicitation; or <br />(ii) the past performance information sought and obtained by the Government reflects other than acceptable performance by the offeror.</p>
<p>The standard for past performance is met when the offeror is determined to have an acceptable performance confidence assessment.</p>
<p>(x) Offerors must submit, along with their offer, a copy of the completed representations and certifications as prescribed in FAR provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items Alt I (Apr 2012) or have current Online Representations and Certification.</p>

As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers.

(b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number.

(c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions. <BR> <BR>(d) Section II, Installation.

For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs.

(b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity.

The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.

<DESC>The government is experiencing some delays and anticipates that the Solicitation will be out on or around December 4, 2012.&nbsp; <br /><br />--------------------------------------<br />The U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) plans to seek proposals from small business firms for participation in Phase I of the Fiscal Year 2013 NOAA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program. Phase I of the SBIR program implements the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011, contained in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (P.L. 112-81), which reauthorizes the SBIR/STTR programs for six years. Small businesses are invited to submit research proposals in response to the Request for Proposals. <br /><br />The purpose of Phase I of the SBIR program is for firms to conduct research and development which will allow the Government to determine the scientific or technical merit and feasibility of concepts, ideas and quality of performance as a prerequisite for further Government support which may follow in Phase II of the program. Any organization or individuals receiving awards under Phase I are be eligible to compete for a Phase II award. The following are the NOAA, Research and Development (R&amp;D) topics available for Phase I: Weather-Ready Nation, Climate Adaptation and Mitigation, Healthy Oceans, Resilient Coastal Communities and Economies.<br /><br />The SBIR solicitation will be issued on or about December 4, 2012. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541712. The SBIR solicitation will be available at the Federal Business Opportunities website www.fbo.gov. Please do not submit questions at this time. After release of the solicitation, it will be the offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for any amendments to the solicitation. The Government anticipates making multiple Phase I awards, each with a period of performance of six (6) months and a ceiling price not to exceed $95,000.00.<br /><br />The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office must be registered within the SAM.gov website (formerly the Central Contractor Registration [CCR] database). NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in SAM.gov. For additional information and to register in SAM, please access the following web site https://www.sam/gov and select the Help Tab. In order to register in SAM and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. A possible source of information for small businesses to use in helping to navigate these systems and learn more about contracting with the government is the Association of Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTAC). In 1985, Congress authorized the Procurement Technical Assistance Program in an effort to help expand the number of businesses capable of participating in the Government Marketplace. The program helps provide matching funds with state and local governments and non-profit organizations to establish these Procurement Technical Assistance Services to provide procurement assistance. They usually provide these service either at low cost or free of charge. You can find your local service center at http://www.aptac-us.org/new/Govt_Contracting/find.php to find out more information.<br /><br />General SBIR - related inquiries may be directed to the NOAA SBIR Program at (301) 713-3565, or SBIR@noaa.gov. Additional questions should be directed to Joan Clarkston, Contract Specialist at (816) 426-7469, fax at (757)664-3623, or email joan.e.clarkston@noaa.gov. When contacting individuals regarding this announcement, please reference in the title Solicitation Number NOAA 2013-1.

This contract encompasses the application of current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability through a technical refresh of its current systems and weapons, as well as procurement of new systems and weapons.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback augmenting the information received in the previous EST RFI dated 24 May 2011.   <br>      <br>   PEO STRI is currently developing its acquisition approach as well as the Period of Performance (POP) of the contract.  However, award will be made to that Offeror who offers the Best Overall Value to the Government.  This acquisition will require access to information classified as  quote mark Sensitive but Unclassified quote mark  or  quote mark For Official Use Only quote mark .   <br>      <br>   BACKGROUND:   <br>   The current Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) is a simulator that provides marksmanship training and trains Soldiers on virtually all aspects of firearms training from calibrating weapons, to weapons qualification, to collective fire scenarios in numerous environments.  The EST is a unit/institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that saves currently required ammunition resources, operation and personnel tempo, as well as travel time and costs to and from ranges.  It enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot (S/DS)), which includes Escalation of Force/graduated response scenarios.  It simulates weapon training events that lead to live-fire individual or crew weapon qualification and training events currently not resourced under Standards in Training Commission (STRAC).  Squad leaders are able to control and evaluate individual, fire team, and squad performance on numerous types of small arms weapons used by U.S. forces and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.  The EST Basic Rifle Marksmanship (BRM) training reduces the requirements for remedial live-fire training.  Soldiers must 'pass' marksmanship gates on the EST prior to going on the live range.  Using the EST capability of rifle cant, trigger pressure, and before-the-shot, during-the-shot, and after-the-shot After Action Reviews (AARs), trainers can quickly identify and correct problems thus raising confidence and first-time qualifications.  Currently, the Army uses EST for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) qualification as well as night-fire qualification.   <br>      <br>   INTENDED CAPABILITIES FOR NEW EST II CONTRACT:   <br>   1.  Primarily EST II shall provide high fidelity marksmanship training events utilizing both performance and results feedback.  Trainees must be able to zero on the EST, apply the corrections to a battle-sight zeroed weapon, and get reasonable accuracy on a live-fire range.   <br>        a. System point accuracy 0.2 mils with round to round ammunition dispersion based on U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) ballistics.   <br>        b. Pseudo real-time Line Of Sight (LOS) correlation to the projection screen.   <br>        c. Pseudo real-time Point of Aim (POA)/Point of Impact (POI) for all rounds fired.   <br>        d. High fidelity After Action Review (AAR) at student and Instructor Operator Station (IOS).   <br>        e. High fidelity weapon interface for Form, Fit and Function with Magazine loading.   <br>        f. All U.S. Army standard Courses of Fire (COF) with results feedback on doctrine scorecard.   <br>        g. Provides pre and post aim point trace for individual weapons.   <br>        h. Provides burst by burst trace for machine gun weapons.   <br>      <br>   2.  Ability to provide training events that support realistic physics-based modeling for environments and models with variable outcomes.   <br>      <br>   3.  Sufficient intellectual property rights in the interface protocols for the Government to allow a third-party contractor to maintain and repair the system and its weapons.   <br>      <br>   4.  Ability to support High Definition Television (HDTV) format interactive video training events for judgmental use of force SDS training.   <br>      <br>   5.  Provide ongoing ability to integrate the Army POR for gaming (currently Virtual Battle space 2 (VBS 2) into the system.   <br>      <br>   HANDS ON INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITY:   <br>   Respondents are invited to use the EST located at PEO STRI, Orlando, for a period of up to 2 business days from 23 January 2012 - 24 February 2012.

The purpose of this RFI is to identify companies which have technologies and expertise that can be or have been applied to the Small Arms Training Task.   <br>      <br>   The EST II Program POR is exploring the possibilities of applying current and emerging technologies to provide the required training capability.  One of the goals of this market research is to identify technical approaches which transfer the burden of marksmanship fault identification from the human instructor to the training system which could then potentially provide remediation for fault correction.   <br>      <br>   The current system (EST 2000) is defined as a system which is a unit / institutional, indoor, multipurpose, multi-lane, small arms, crew-served and individual anti-tank training simulation that enables training across three different modes: individual marksmanship; small unit (collective) gunnery and tactical training; and judgmental use of force (shoot/don't shoot), which includes Escalation of Force / graduated response scenarios.   <br>      <br>   Interested Sources should provide the following information:   <br>      <br>   1).  Pertinent Company administrative data as to large or small business category IAW the designated NAICS.  Each Offeror is to identify whether or not the company is a STOC II prime.   <br>      <br>   2).  Company history.   <br>      <br>   3).  Identify company interest in the program as a Prime contractor or subcontractor to a prime.  Each Offeror is to provide recent program history (last 10 years) of company past experience in delivering small arms trainers or components of small arms trainers.   <br>      <br>   4).  Identification of technologies which have potential and/or demonstrated application to the small arms training task.  Each identified technology is to be categorized by Technology Readiness Level rating system.   <br>      <br>   Responses to this RFI are to not exceed 15 single sided, letter-sized pages.  Font is not to be smaller than 12 points.   <br>      <br>   This announcement is published for market research purposed only.  This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products.  Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.  No funds are available to pay for the preparation of responses to this announcement.   <br>      <br>   Submit RFI responses by 1600 Eastern Standard Time 14 June 2011, to the following email address:   <br>      <br>   Cori Lampe   <br>   Contract Specialist, SFAE-STRI-KOV   <br>   Email: Corisann.M.Lampe@us.army.mil   <br>      <br>   Comments via e-mail to the designated Contract Specialist, Cori Lampe - information listed below using the attached EST II Program POR Q&A form.   <br>      <br>   Questions with answers will be posted as an update to the RFI.

The system provides for efficient loading of environmental data (location meta data, sample analysis results, field parameters, etc.) into a relational database and automates many basic quality assurance, routine data analysis, and reporting tasks required under the RFI. The DBMS may be executed either locally with a desktop installation (Desktop DBMS) to upload and analyze project specific data, or using the GSA application portal (Site-Wide DBMS) via the internet for verification of project-specific data deliverables and for analysis and reporting of site-wide RFI data. The DBMS is propitiatory code and is being made available to responders for use to respond to this effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Access to the DBMS and will be granted upon award of specific projects. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Use of this program on any projects other than those required by GSA is prohibited.</p>

While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.    (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.    (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions. <BR> <BR>(d) Section II, Installation.

Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.    (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

<AWARDEE>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, Code 210.P, Greenbelt, MD 20771
<DESC>NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA/GSFC) has a requirement for "Power & Privilege: Race Workshops". NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the services from S.L. Robbins and Associates on a sole source basis. The primary objective of the work to be performed is to examine issues of power, privilege, diversity, and inclusion and race and how they affect everyone, regardless of color, at Goddard. The workshop will enable participants to be more aware of and skillful at managing discrepancies related to race, power, privilege, diversity, and inclusion as they carry out their functional supervisory and leadership duties across the Center. It will also increase their capacity to recognize and discuss dynamics of race, power, privilege, diversity, and inclusion within their functional organizations and thus create opportunities for improving understanding, problem solving, decision-making, and teamwork. S.L. Robbins & Associates has successfully developed and previously delivered a Race, Power, and Privilege workshop module for other Goddard Organizations. The workshops design and facilitation effectively enabled participants, regardless of race, to examine and discuss the systemic nature of racial privilege and its impact on themselves and at Goddard. Several Goddard organizations, members of the Center's Management Council and individuals attended the previous S.L. Robbins and Associates workshop. OHCM, EEO and the Diversity Special Assistant (supported by Goddard Management) have determined that all supervisors and influence leaders need to revive the same training in order for the center to fully accomplish the goals of its future planning initiative. The previously delivered workshop required has been modified in order to highlight Goddard specific context, but the foundations of the workshop remain in their entirety. S.L. Robbins & Associates has extensive, unique experience in working with the organizational cultures at the GSFC. They have proven skills and expertise in creating the necessary transformative experience in this culture for brining the issue of racism from a cognitive, conceptual and analytical level to an effective, operational and solution-oriented level. S.L. Robbins & Associates is uniquely qualified to conduct a training workshop similar to the one found to be so effective in the Goddard culture previously and to apply it to the specific needs of OHCM, EEO and the Special Assistant for Diversity. For this workshop to enable OHCM to remain a leading voice in the Centers conservation about race, power, privilege, diversity and inclusion and to fulfill its obligations to the Center's diversity strategy, S.L. Robbins is the only responsible source. No other potential source that possesses the experience, skills, and knowledge necessary to successfully meet the Office of Human Capital Management (OHCM) requirements for this workshop are known to exist. The information provided in the workshop is copyrighted material. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is the Services Acquisition Reform Act of 2003 (41 U.S.C. 428a), as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.501 (a)(1)(ii). Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced bites may be viewed at the following URLs lined below.
