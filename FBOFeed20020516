<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a REMOTE ACQUISITION AND STORAGE SYSTEM (RASS)this field acoustic measurement system will be used in order to study and measure aircraft noise impact in the field. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase this research and development study from  VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY (VCU), SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING, who is the only responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements. Under a grant with NASA/LaRC, VCU studied and designed a miniature sized central processing unit for the purpose of making an acoustic measurement system smaller and power efficient.  VCU has developed an unparalleled knowledge base of capabilities of the RASS that would take substantial time and money for another company to duplicate the design and study results and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing (Phone Calls are not accepted) to Ms. Terry Cobb, NASA/LaRC, M/S 126, Hampton, VA 23681; fax number 757-864-6966, not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on MAY 29, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for software and hardware maintenance on the "AMASS" software for the Clouds and The Earths Radiant Energy System (CERES) Program. The period of performance is 12 months with options for 2 additional 12 month periods. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Advanced Digital Information Group (ADIG) as the only known source who can meet Agency needs. Over the past 2 years, NASA Langley Research Center has been using the ADIG's "AMASS" Software in the CERES Program and associated maintenance to manage the file storage systems needed to accomplish the Center's mission projects. ADIG holds the rights to this particular software and is the only known source of maintenance on this file management system. If another vendor were selected, Langley Research Center would first need to replace the existing file storage installations, necessitating acquisition of new hardware, migration of the stored and archived files onto new environments, and then retiring the old environment. These costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 24th, 2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>IT IS A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CONTRACTOR BE REGISTERED IN THE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION PRIOR TO AWARD OF THE CONTRACT.  The work includes furnishing all labor, materials, supervision, equipment, tools, permits, training, certifications, and licenses necessary to provide servicing of waste oil accumulation points and oil/water separators, transport and disposal of waste oil, and other waste oil management services at the Coastal Systems Station in Panama City, FL.  These services include, but are not limited to performing scheduled and on-call waste collection; field testing and classification; hazardous and non-hazardous oily waste; operation of oil/water separators and oil waste dump stations; servicing ships at pierside hotel stations to include maintaining the hotel stations and pierside utility boxes at dockside; and groundwater monitoring well inspection and bailing.  The resultant contract will be a combination firm fixed price and indefinite quantity service type contract.  The contract award will be for a period of twelve months with four additional option periods not to exceed a total of 60 months.  Contract award will be based on the evaluation of two factors:  (1)  the offeror's price and (2) the offeror's recent relevant past performance.  Price is considered relatively more important than past performance.  However, the selection decision will depend on the marginal differences among the competing offers, which will not be known until after all the offers have been received and compared with each other.  The offeror's price and past performance information will be used to evaluate which offer is the best overall value to the Government.   Price Evaluation:  The price competitiveness of each offer will be evaluated by comparing each offeror's prices for the solicitation.  Past Performance Evaluation:  The Navy will review information about the offeror's past performance within the last five years on work that is similar to this solicitation in size, scope, and complexity.  More recent and relevant experience may be viewed more favorably.  Past performance includes the degree by which the offeror has satisfied its customers by delivering quality work in a timely manner at a reasonable total cost.  It also includes the offeror's reputation for integrity, reasonable and cooperative conduct, and commitment to customer satisfaction.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all quotes at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any and all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest price; and to award a contract to the offeror submitting the quote determined to be the most advantageous to the Government.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE QUOTES RECEIVED.  THEREFORE, QUOTES SHOULD BE SUBMITTED ON THE MOST FAVORABLE TERMS FROM A PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE STANDPOINT WHICH THE OFFEROR CAN SUBMIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.  OFFERORS SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT THEY WILL BE CONTACTED OR AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO QUALIFY, DISCUSS, OR REVISE THE QUOTE.  The NAICCS Code is 562111 ($6M).  This Solicitation is unrestricted with 10% price evaluation preference for Hub-Zone Small Business Concerns.

<DESC>See Notes 22 and 26.  The Multi-Wavelength Nephelometer will be used in conjuction with a LIDAR system that is being developed by the Forest Service, Fire Chemistry Work Unit (RWU-4404).  The LIDAR system will be used to remotely measure various properties of smoke aerosols in plumes and in widespread regional haze layers resulting from vegetative burning.  LIDAR measurements are stongly dependant on the optical properties of the smoke aerosols.  To achieve good estimates of particle concentration using LIDAR techiniques, the light scattering characteristics of the aerosol in the near field, a Multi-Wavelength Nephelometer is needed.  The Nephelometer must have a visible range between 435 and 740 nanometers (nm); have a minimum of three wavelengths with at least one measurement each in the following wavelength ranges:  435-500 nm (blue), 520-565 nm (green), and 625-740 nm (red); have a scattering coefficient measurement range (60 seconds) of 5.0x10^-7 meter^-1<>5.0x10^-3 meter^-1; have a scattering angle (normal operation) of 10<>170 degrees; have additional sensors for sample temperature and RH; have the ability to mesasure solid and non-volatile liquids; have an aerosol temperature range of 10-30 degrees centigrade; have a non-condensing relative humidity/temperature range of 10% to 90% RH; have an internal or supplied external pump; have an instrument operating temperature range of 10<>30 degrees centigrade; have a non-condensing instrument operating humidity range of 10% to 90% RH; have a minimum size and weight; and have the internal or external supply power of 110 to 120 VAC, 60 cycle, minimum wattage,  In addition, the Nephelometer must include software to process and store the data measured by the instrument.  Graphical interface software should be included to display the scattering for each wavelength measured.

22.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is soley within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered soley for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

26.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its soliciation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commmercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTE: THIS IS A RE-ADVERTISEMENT OF THE PREVIOUSLY SYNOPSIZED U.S. CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER PROJECT. PLEASE REFER TO SOLICITATION NUMBERS GS-03P-02-AOC-0001 ORIGINALLY POSTED ON 9 NOVEMBER, 2001 AND GS-03P-02-AOC-0002 ORIGINALLY POSTED ON 21 DEC, 2001. THESE TWO PROJECTS HAVE BEEN COMBINED AND WILL BE AWARDED AS A SINGLE CONTRACT. THIS PROCUREMENT IS HEREBY OPEN TO ALL QUALIFIED RESPONDENTS.

The Architect of the Capitol (AOC), with the assistance of the General Services Administration (GSA), announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings and the intent to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Construction Services for The United States Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) and related work in and around the Capitol Building, Washington, DC. The CVC will greatly enhance the experience of visiting the U.S. Capitol building. Not only will it significantly enhance security for the Capitol, but it will provide new educational opportunities for visitors and improve accessibility and visitor comfort. As designed, the CVC will compliment the Capitol building and its surroundings and will become a seamless addition to the
Capitol complex. The CVC will be located underground on the East Front of the Capitol, so as to enhance rather than detract from the appearance of the Capitol and its historic Frederick Law Olmsted landscaping. When completed, the CVC will contain approximately 580,000 square feet on three levels, requiring approximately a 196,000-square-foot excavation, or "footprint," on the East Front of the Capitol. The CVC will include space for exhibits, visitor comfort, food service, two orientation theaters, an auditorium, gift shops, security, connections to existing buildings, service tunnels for underground vehicle access to the Capitol, loading docks, mechanical facilities, and storage. The CVC will preserve and maximize public access to the Capitol while greatly enhancing the experience for the millions who walk its historic corridors and experience its monumental spaces every year. This solicitation will address only a portion of the work required to complete the CVC, as noted below. The Architect of the Capitol will utilize a ?best value? source selection process to enable selection from among high quality contractors for this procurement. The project will be constructed in two (2) sequences.    This advertisement is for Sequence 1 of the project which will require extensive coordination between this contractor and contractors of prior enabling projects and the subsequent Sequence 2, as well as with contractors performing other AOC projects in the immediate vicinity of the project.  Sequence 1 is for the Foundation/Structure work which includes, but is not limited to, Miscellaneous Site Demolition, Slurry Wall Construction, Excavation, Installation of Load Bearing Elements (including Caissons with imbedded Steel Columns), Concrete, Structural Steel, Tunnel/Tunnel Concrete, Elevator Jack Holes, Small Mechanical and Electrical and Site Civil. The estimated construction cost for Sequence 1 is in the range of $80 to $100 million. The contractor must provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided), and must plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective performance of all construction to meet AOC requirements. The Contractor will perform the construction in accordance with the design specifications, drawings, and the provisions of the contract. The solicitation for Sequence 1 will be issued in two (2) phases. Phase I will be for technical proposals and will include a set of draft specifications and drawings. It will be available on or about 02/13/2002. UNDER THIS PART THE GOVERNMENT WILL EVALUATE PAST PERFORMANCE, TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES. OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED OF THEIR TECHNICAL STANDING PRIOR TO ISSUANCE OF PHASE II, WHICH WILL BE A REQUEST FOR OFFERORS OF HIGH TECHNICAL STANDING TO SUBMIT PRICING PROPOSALS BASED UPON COMPLETED SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS. Phase II of the solicitation will be issued approximately 45 days after receipt of
proposals for Phase I. The government will award a fixed-price contract after evaluation of both Phases I and II proposals resulting from this solicitation to the responsive and responsible offeror determined by the government to be the ?best value? to the government. For this procurement, technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price, but no specific numerical weight will be assigned to price for evaluation purposes. Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used similar to those in FAR 15. Offerers are advised an award may be made without discussion or any contact concerning the proposals received. The government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the government to be the most advantageous to the government. Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms. NOTE: Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for proposal preparation costs. To be considered for final award, potential offeror must submit proposals per the RFP to BOTH Phase I and Phase II of the solicitation on the due dates established. A pre-proposal meeting and site visit will be held at the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) project field office at a date to be determined later. The RFP Phase I will be issued by the Contract Specialist at GSA, Mid Atlantic Region in Philadelphia, PA, and posted electronically on the www.fedbizops.gov website. Hard copies or CD?s of the draft specifications and drawings and RFP Phase II, Technical Specifications and Drawings will be issued by the AOC, Washington, DC. In order for potential offerors to be placed on the bidders list for hard copies or CD?s, respondents must submit a written request via fax to Cal Durgin, (202) 228-2073 or e-mailed to cdurgin@aoc.gov. Requests from prime contractors must include a letter from the surety stating their capacity for bonding in amounts covering the estimated prices cited above to receive hard copies or CD?s. Any questions regarding this synopsis may be directed to Cal Durgin, CVC Contract Specialist, at (202) 228-2370 or Dan Correnti, GSA Contract Specialist, at (215) 656-6152. This procurement is being conducted under full and open competition on an unrestricted basis under NAIC code 233320.

<DESC>TELEPHONED, E-MAILED, OR FAXED REQUESTS for this RFA (Request for Applications) WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  This RFA is SET ASIDE for State Departments of Transportation (or equivalent).  There is NO INCUMBENT contractor, and no incumbent recipient.  In this RFA, which the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) currently estimates will be published on approximately June 14, 2002 in FedBizOpps at http://www.eps.gov, the FHWA will be seeking Applications for a new Cooperative Agreement to be entitled ?Surface Transportation Security and Reliability Information System Model Deployment.?  The Recipient of that Cooperative Agreement will participate in a model deployment to enhance the security, reliability and safety of the surface transportation system through the widespread availability of real-time information.  That model deployment will examine how surface transportation security and reliability can be improved under the five specific situations or scenarios described below:

1.	Major metropolitan areas ? The collection and dissemination of real-time information on all principal arterials, freeways, major rail and bus systems, and intermodal connectors and facilities to support security management and emergency evacuation and response.   On a day-to-day basis, this real-time information will also support improved congestion management and incident response, enhanced travel time reliability, improved safety and better overall operational performance of the metropolitan area surface transportation system.

2.	Statewide information systems  ? The widespread collection and dissemination of information on incidents, weather events, and other scheduled and non-scheduled lane and road closures that can significantly impact security management and emergency response by reducing travel capacity on major highways.

3.	Security of critical infrastructure ? The surveillance and monitoring of critical bridges and tunnels; major rail and bus facilities; freight and intermodal connectors and terminals; and major hazardous materials and military routes to detect potential security problems, provide alerts and assist in post-event analysis.

4.	Non-metropolitan evacuation ? Traffic and weather monitoring of key roadways or corridors outside of metropolitan areas to support emergency evacuations caused by either man-made or natural disasters.  

5.	Weather response ? The collection and use of road weather information to improve safety and operational response to weather-related events such as flood, fog, snow or ice.  

This model deployment will provide new information and insights on:

?	Innovative approaches and technologies for providing security monitoring and management of critical infrastructure, particularly tunnels, bridges and key intermodal freight and transit facilities.

?	Collection and operational use of traffic and weather data to support emergency evacuation.

?	The data needed to support security management, emergency evacuation, congestion management, freight management, safety management, weather response, and traveler information.  This includes learning about the spacing, coverage, frequency, and mix of innovative and traditional data sources.

?	Innovative approaches and technologies for monitoring and collecting traffic, transit, truck and intermodal freight, weather and transportation security information. 

?	The amount of surveillance or monitoring needed to support improved transportation security and reliability as a function of traffic volumes and geographic area.

?	New institutional arrangements needed for the integration and sharing of data.

The USDOT expects this model deployment to demonstrate today?s best practices, and to foster innovative approaches in the collection, processing, use, dissemination, sharing, and archiving of surface transportation information.  It is important that the model deployment not just demonstrate how best to deploy innovative surveillance, monitoring and data collection systems, but also demonstrate what data becomes available for surface transportation system operations and how such data is actually used to improve transportation security, safety and reliability. 

The U.S. DOT will provide $10,000,000 in funds over a four-year period for this model deployment.   In accordance with statutory requirements (see ?5001(b) and ?5207(d) of TEA-21), the selected State must provide----OVER AND ABOVE that $10,000,000 DOT funding figure----a minimum MATCHING share of 20%, from NON-federally derived funding sources.

The U.S. DOT expects a State Department of Transportation (or equivalent) to be the lead agency (i.e., the PRIME Applicant) for each proposal (i.e., Application) submitted in response to this RFA; but DOT encourages States to establish partnerships with other public agencies (e.g., public safety agencies, transit agencies, etc.) and with private sector companies in responding to this RFA.  The term ?or equivalent?, as used in this announcement, refers to a situation in which a particular state government does NOT have any agency whose NAME is ?Department of Transportation?, but instead has a transportation-cognizant state agency with some OTHER name, such as ?Department of Roads?.  The PRIME Applicant under this RFA CANNOT be a LOCAL transportation agency.

The U.S. DOT expects that the first two years of the effort will be devoted to a combination of design and deployment of the components of the surface transportation information system.  The U.S. DOT, and its representatives, will conduct an evaluation of the operational use of the deployed information system components during the second two years of the effort.

TELEPHONED, E-MAILED, OR FAXED REQUESTS FOR THIS RFA WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  Instead, all prospective Applicants (i.e., offerors) are to obtain this RFA from FedBizOpps, at http://www/eps.gov.  Any subsequent AMENDMENTS to the RFA will LIKEWISE be published in FedBizOpps at the Internet address cited above, and the FHWA does NOT plan to mail out any HARD copies of any such Amendments.  Therefore, it shall be the responsibility of each Applicant to closely and frequently MONITOR FedBizOpps for any AMENDMENTS to the RFA.  Monitoring FedBizOpps for any Amendments to the RFA will be absolutely ESSENTIAL for all prospective Applicants, since Amendments usually contain crucial information.  Please note that the due date shown above is merely an ESTIMATE of the date on which Applications will be due.  The ACTUAL due date for receipt of Applications will be stated in the RFA.

                        Amendment No. 1
                                                                                                to

        Request for Applications (RFA) No. DTFH61-02-X-00089


This Amendment No. 1 is issued for the purpose of  clarifying the Pre-Solicitation Notice published in FedBizOpps on May 14, 2002.   To that end, all prospective applicants (i.e., offerors) are hereby advised of the following:


1.	The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has been asked to provide to all prospective applicants a list of all State Departments of Transportation, with telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, and contact persons.  The FHWA declines to perform that research but hereby advises all prospective applicants that the information in question could probably be obtained on the Internet.

2.	In a message sent to the FHWA, a prospective applicant has ?requested? this RFA.  The FHWA will not be sending hard copies of this RFA (nor its Amendments) to any prospective applicant.  Instead, each applicant must closely and frequently monitor the FedBizOpps web site and must retrieve the RFA and all Amendments electronically from that web site.


No other clarifications or corrections are provided in this Amendment No. 1 to the Pre-Solicitation Notice.

Responses to this sources sought notice should include the following: (a) Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number and email address; (b) description of the company?s core line(s) of business; (c) Indication of whether the company is a manufacturer or reseller of wireless telephone equipment or services and, if so, what specific equipment and services; and (d) Identification of any Federal Government contracts that the company has been awarded as a prime Contractor that are currently in effect that could be used by DoC NIST to satisfy the requirements noted above.  Responses to this sources sought notice must be sent by email to Joseph.Widdup@nist.gov and received at that address no later than Friday, May 31, 2002.

<SUBJECT>19 -- RESPONSE BOAT - MEDIUM
<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to procure a marine craft (Response Boat--Medium (RB-M)) that will provide operational commanders with the capability to meet current and projected multi-mission demand in the coastal environment.  Among the multiple missions are Search and Rescue (SAR), Marine Environmental Protection (MEP), Enforcement of Laws and Treaties (ELT), Port Safety and Security (PSS), Defense Operations (DO) and Recreational Boating Safety (RBS).  The RB-M project will re-capitalize the capability of the existing multi-mission 41 foot Utility Boats (UTB). The RB-M will also provide some capabilities that exceed those in the existing UTB fleet.  The RB-M project will be conducted as a two-phased acquisition. In Phase I, the Coast Guard intends to award up to three firm-fixed-price contracts for test boats of different designs.  One of the three awards will be set-aside exclusively for small business.   The three awards are expected to be made this fall for delivery of test boats within six months of award.  The USCG will test and evaluate each test boat.  These test results will be a factor in determining which Phase I contractor who successfully constructed and delivered a test boat will be awarded the production contract in Phase II.  Phase II will be a limited competition for one production contract for up to approximately 180 boats over a period of five to ten years.  The Phase II contract will also include an option for USCG to obtain technical data rights for the successful design to be used by USCG to build the same type of boat at a USCG facility.  The NAICS code is 336612 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. The USCG intends to post draft portions of the Phase I RFP (i.e., Statement of Work, Specifications, Sections B, L, and M) on the Project Web Site, as they are completed and intends to issue a pre-solicitation synopsis at least 15 days prior to the issuance of the Phase I RFP. Interested businesses may access these drafts and post comments at http://www.hjfordweb.com/arb. Comments by interested parties should be submitted within two business days of posting.  Comments will be considered and necessary changes reflected in the final Phase I RFP.  The primary Point of Contact for this solicitation, Ms. Linda Bonham, may be contacted via email address ?lbonham@comdt.uscg.mil.?

<SUBJECT>A -- SMART WEAPONS TESTING IN NON_TRADITIONAL TEST ENVIRONMENTS
<DESC>The Air Armament Center, Joint Munitions Test and Evaluation Program Office, Project CHICKEN LITTLE (CL), Eglin AFB FL intends to pursue supporting smart weapons testing in non-traditional test environments.   These environments could include extremes of temperature, specific foliage, unique topography or other conditions that can not be supported by existing test locations.  Test events at these locations are intended to support smart weapons seeker and sensors evaluations and instrumented target signature collections.  The CL office currently has the ability to deploy to remote and partially bare-based type field locations in support of such data collection activities.     These test events will utilize foreign and domestic, classified and unclassified, ground mobile vehicles including relocatable surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missile systems, and other air defense units as test items in a static and dynamic environment intended to gather weapon system performance, seeker/sensor system performance, and signature data collection for analysis and algorithm development.  
     This is an invitation to government and industry to identify requirements for test activities at these type locations in the ?03 ??06 time frame.  Participants must provide all necessary aerial platforms, hardware/software systems including seeker/sensor instrumentation, and all personnel to accomplish the complete set of data collection missions.  Participants will be responsible for providing all necessary insurance for personnel and hardware, hold harmless agreements, etc., to conduct such test activities.  It is CL policy that data collected and retained during this event will be protected as propriety and securely stored at the appropriate classification level(s) and will be included in the on?going CL data-basing activity.  Data will not be released/disseminated without consent of the owner/sponsor of the hardware.
	Participants will be invited to sign a Statement of Capability (SOC) with CL.  This SOC will define the basis for participation and identify specific requirements to be mutually satisfied with the Government.  Costs for identified participants as a result of this solicitation will be allocated to each participant based on the individual level of activity and resource requirements for their participation.  Offerors will be required to have established security clearances for all involved personnel at the time of SOC signature.
	Since this is not a request for a formal contract award, there will be no Request for Proposal (RFP), nor will any binding selection criteria be prepared.  Participation under the SOC is not subject to the Contracts Dispute Act of 1978 and not subject to arbitration or dispute.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.
