When combined, the non-price factors are significantly more important than price.


C.  	Questions and Responses  relative to RFA No. W914NS-04-R-0157
 

1. Does the CPA envision a specific job creation condition as a result of each loan? For example, is it required that 1 job is created for every $15,000 lent?

Response:  No		 

2. What is the required (or expected) percentage contribution of capital by the small business owner in relation to the amount contributed by Administrator/Grantee?

Response:  No specific standard. This will be decided by the Iraqi financial institution through which the loan application is submitted.		 

3. Can the Administrator/Grantee charge the small business owner a loan fee to cover administrative costs?

Response:  The Administrator’s costs are paid through the grant.  The Applicant can propose to charge a fee to cover costs for the Administrator’s efforts.		 

4. Is the one year grace period for loan repayment a requirement, or can it be shorter?

Response:  The one year grace period for loan repayment is a requirement.

Response:  No industry preferences or restrictions.		 

7. On page 6, under item number 4, what is meant by materially worse than the aggregate loan portfolio?

Response:  The Administrator, using data from the Grantee, will measure the performance of the portfolio of loans that each Grantee makes using grant funds.  Any Grantee whose portfolio or grant-funded loan is substantially below the average will be precluded from further participation in the program, upon the recommendation of the Administrator, and the decision of the Grantor. The Administrator should recommend to the Grantor a quantitative measurement of “materially worse.”		 

8. What is the relationship between the Grantor and the Administrator, specifically with regard to the termination conditions? How much of the fee is the Administrator eligible for? What guidelines and parameters are the Administrator expected to follow?

Response:  The relationship between the Grantor and Administrator, and the Administrator guidelines and parameters, are described in the RFA.  The Applicant must propose a fee that is will receive for acting as Administrator.  The Administrator is not required to share this fee with any third party, but the Administrator is responsible for its own expenses.

9.  Will there be flexibility for the Administrator to conduct a reasonable phased geographical rollout of the program, or is the Administrator expected to be able to begin operations immediately on a nation wide basis?
Response:  The Administrator is not required to have offices throughout Iraq, but should have a means of communicating, including exchanging of documents, with Iraqi financial institutions located in major cities.  It is permissible to take a reasonable amount of time to make these arrangements.

10.  Asked another way - Would an applicant who can demonstrate the ability to immediately begin operations in the central region and who can show that they can begin operations in the North and South in a reasonable period thereafter be excluded from the tender?

Response:  No

Description:  The purpose of the grant program that will be operated by the Administrator is to provide grants to Iraqi financing institutions (“Grantees”), which Grantees will leverage on a one-to-one basis for small business lending to businesses owned and operated by Iraqis.  It is expected to lead to a sustainable commercial lending profile in the Iraqi finance industry with the intention of providing a successful example that would be duplicated in all financial institutions in the country.  This is in line with efforts by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) to provide economic rehabilitation and reform in Iraq to stimulate domestic and foreign investment, domestic and international trade, employment, and broad-based prosperity through private capital formation. 

In Iraq, there is strong demand for small business finance activities. Iraq has a relatively large domestic market and deep entrepreneurial roots.  Despite recently undergoing economic turmoil Iraq has the natural resources and infrastructure to support small businesses. A small business commercial lending program delivered by locally present financing institutions, using sound lending methodologies, has great potential to be successful.

The country faces large and urgent challenges in revitalizing the economy and creating new jobs.  Credit availability is a key factor in revitalizing the economy. The country’s capital stock has been seriously depleted and there has been little investment in plant and equipment for many years. 

Historically, small-and-medium size businesses have been successfully engaged in trading activities, agribusiness, light manufacturing, and a variety of other sectors. The primary objective of the activities under this grant program is to generate a productive and growing private sector, create rapid employment, and lay the foundation for sustainable growth and economic development.

Anticipated Results and Impact.  (1) The small business loans made possible by these grants will provide businesses, some of which have few other alternatives for obtaining needed capital, with financial resources for investment, expansion, working capital and other legitimate business purposes, thereby stimulating job creation and economic growth; (2) The grants will bolster financial institutions’ balance sheets. The experience gained by the applicants in making loans with grant funds will increase the technical and managerial competence of the applicants. The grant funds also will provide applicants with opportunities to increase their customer base by seeking out new borrowers to whom to lend; (3) The program has been designed for maximum flexibility and simplicity in order to facilitate a credit flow to small businesses as quickly as feasible in view of the current stressful economic and political situation in Iraq, including high unemployment, large excess manufacturing capacity and severe shortage of medium term credit through the financial system.

General Program Description and Focus.  Objective: (1) Enable funds to be distributed into the economy quickly via small business loans, thus stimulating commercial activity and creating employment in the private sector; (2) Provide impetus and capability to financial institutions to establish medium term lending programs (two years to five years) based on sound financial practices and cash flow analysis.

Grantee criteria.  (1) Private sector financial institutions in Iraq in good standing that engage in lending, including private sector banks and NGOs engaged in microfinance, will be eligible to receive Grants; (2) Grants in the aggregate to an individual Grantee may not comprise more than 50% (giving effect to the grants) of the total loan portfolio of the Grantee.

Loan Characteristics:  (1)  Funding: Each loan made with grant funds (“Small Business Loan”) must be comprised 50% of grant funds and 50% of funds from the Grantee’s own resources;  (2) Size:  Each Small Business Loan must be between $25,000 and $500,000. Each Grant with respect to a Small Business Loan will therefore be in the range of $12,500 to $250,000; (3) Term:  Small Business Loans will have a final maturity within the range of two to five years. Level amortization payments shall begin no earlier than the 12-month anniversary of the loan; (4) Small Business Loans must carry an interest rate that conforms to Iraq financial market standards current at the time of the making of the loan; (5) Borrowers under this program must be majority owned by Iraqis and operated by Iraqis. No state-owned enterprises, but joint ventures are eligible so long as majority owned and operated by Iraqi private sector; (6) Borrowers must utilize the funds for legitimate business purposes; (7) Note that borrowers do not need to be “small businesses”. Grantees may apply their own credit risk standards in making decisions whether or not to extend Small Business Loans; (8) As part of its due diligence and credit analysis process, each Grantee must produce a business plan for each Small Business Loan it intends to make including the following information on the borrower: (a) use of proceeds; (b) business description; (c) competitive analysis; (c) historical financial statements; (d) projected future financial statements (giving effect to the loan); (e) projected cash flow debt service coverage ratios; (f) description of management; (g) description of shareholders


Excluded Transactions: (a) Activities related to tobacco; (b) Activities related to the production of alcoholic beverages; (c) Drug products not certified by applicable health authorities; (d) Activities related to gambling; (e) Activities related to military


Administrator Responsibilities.  (1) The Administrator and the Grantor shall establish a segregated bank account in a reputable bank for the grant funds (the “Grant Pool”). The Grantor will have signature authority over the account which it will delegate to the Administrator in whole or in part at its discretion. The Grantor at its discretion may transfer all or a portion of available funds at any time into the Grant Pool for onward distribution to Grantees. The Administrator may only transfer funds from the Grant Pool in order to fund Small Business Loans and for no other purpose. The Administrator shall not transfer funds from the Grant Pool to pay any expense or fee or procurement on behalf of the Administrator or any third party. (2) The Administrator shall receive applications for Grants from potential Grantees.  Prior to forwarding application to Administrator, Grantee will review application and perform credit investigation on borrower.  If Grantee approves loan, then Grantee may forward to Administrator for apply for matching funds.  Each such application will include documentary evidence to demonstrate conformance with all items under “Grantee Criteria”, “Loan Characteristics” and “Excluded Transactions” but the Administrator shall not impose onerous or unreasonably burdensome requirements on the Grantee relative to compiling the application. The Administrator will use reasonable judgment in viewing the evidence but will not be required to confirm the accuracy or completeness of the evidence and will not be liable for any mistakes or omissions in the evidence. (3) Upon successful review of an application, the Administrator shall instruct the Grantee to disburse the amount of the Grantee’s own matching funds (50% of the amount of the proposed Small Business Loan) to the borrower. Upon evidence of such disbursement on a timely basis, the Administrator shall transfer the grant portion of the Small Business Loan from the Grant Pool directly into the account of the borrower. Payment of principal and interest on the entire Small Business Loan will be due to the Grantee, and the Administrator shall have no responsibility for ensuring the borrower’s performance under the loan agreement with the Grantee. (4) The Administrator shall require periodic reports from the Grantee on the performance of the Small Business Loans made with grant funds. The Administrator shall be empowered (subject to Grantor’s discretion) to preclude from further participation in the program any Grantee whose Small Business Loan portfolio performance is materially worse than the aggregate Small Business Loan portfolio, excluding the Grantee in consideration. (5) The Administrator shall not give preference in allocating Grants to particular Grantees. Applications for Grants shall be processed in the order received. Any Grantee may not submit more than two applications per week in order to allow all Grantees access to the Grant Pool. (6) The Administrator shall consult periodically with the Grantor on the progress and performance of the program; shall prepare and provide  Quarterly Utilization Reports to the Grantor no later than 15 calendar days after the close of a quarter; and shall provide other information whether in the form of reports or otherwise as requested by the Grantor to fulfill Grantor’s statutory and management responsibilities and objectives. (7) The Grantor in its sole discretion shall have the power to exclude any actual or potential Grantee from the program or limit participation in the program. If the Administrator believes that any actual or potential Grantee should be excluded or limited on the basis of financial, legal, moral or other valid reason, it shall promptly consult with the Grantor and carry out the instructions of the Grantor. (8) The Administrator shall not accept applications for grants from any Grantee under common control or ownership with the Administrator.

Start-Up, Implementation, Duration and Termination.  (1) The Administrator should be prepared to begin administration of the program within one week of signing the contract. The Administrator shall promote at its own expense the existence of the program with potential grantees in all areas of the country with the intent of achieving a reasonable geographic dispersion of grant funds.(2) The program will terminate at the end of one year. Any grant funds not expended by that time will be donated to a charitable organization for activities in Iraq, by decision of the Grantor after consultation with the Administrator. (3) The Grantor may terminate the Administrator at any time, with or without cause. If so terminated, the Administrator will be eligible to receive fees, in accordance with the contract, proportionate to its level of activity prior to termination date.

 Reporting Requirements.  (1) Quarterly Utilization Reports of the amount of grant funds used in the preceding period are required of the Administrator per information noted above. (2) Grant recipients may be subject to an audit during the 12 months that this facility is available.  This audit would be limited to review of the loans made under this program and their general administration and would be paid for by the Grantor using funds from the Grant Pool or otherwise at the Grantor’s discretion.
  
Oversight.  The Administrator will be accountable to Grantor for achieving tasks set forth in the contract. All tasks under the contract are to be carried out subject to the supervision, direction, and any necessary redirection by the Grantor.

Duration of the contract period: one year from Grant Award

<SUBJECT>B -- Traumatic Brain Injury Data Comparability
<DESC>Negotiations are being conducted on a sole source basis with Kessler Medical Rehabilitation Research & Education Corporation for a traumatic brain injury data comparability study.
I.  Background and Need
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is among the leading causes of death and lifelong disability among children and young adults in the United States.  Approximately 250,000 Americans sustain serious TBI each year.  The cost of TBI, from acute care, rehabilitation, chronic care, and indirect care is estimated at $56 billion annually.  This estimate does not account for the tremendous financial and emotional costs borne by friends and family members of persons with TBI.  
Traumatic brain injury is largely preventable.  However, the current lack of available information prevents public health professionals from accurately determining the numbers of persons affected, the severity of these injuries, underlying causes and risk factors, persons at increased risk, and the outcomes among survivors of traumatic brain injury.  The CDC’s Division of Injury and Disability Outcomes and Programs, at the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, is funding a TBI follow-up registry in South Carolina to determine the outcomes of  TBI in a representative sample of people with TBI.  The SC TBI Follow-up Registry provides unique population-based outcomes data on TBI in the US that can be compared with data from other national TBI outcomes studies.  
 The NIDRR funded TBI Model Systems sites also collect detailed information on outcomes of TBI.  However, their study population is limited to a subset of the TBI population that is severely injured and received inpatient rehabilitation.  Public health professionals could gain insight into unique sample characteristics of the TBI Model Systems by comparing selected pre-injury, injury-related and follow-up indices with population-based estimates of these variables derived from the CDC-funded SC TBI Follow-up Registry.  In this way, the sample distribution of the TBI Model System could be “anchored” in the context of population-based estimates.  
This contract proposes analyses on demographic, pre-injury, injury severity, and outcome indices that are shared by the TBI Model Systems National Dataset and the South Carolina TBI Follow-up Registry. 
 
This activity is covered in PL. 104-166, the Traumatic Brain Injury Act, which authorizes CDC to collect and disseminate information on the prevalence of disability associated with TBI. 
 
II.        Purpose  
            The purpose of this contract is to obtain expert assistance for the Division of Injury and Disability Outcomes and Programs, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control to increase our knowledge by comparing data from the CDC-funded SC TBI Registry with those from the NIDRR-funded TBI Model Systems.  Products will include a detailed technical report of the study methods and findings. 
 
III. Scope of Work
 The vendor will consult with the Program Development and Surveillance Team, Division of Injury and Disability Outcomes and Programs, to develop an analysis plan for comparing data from the TBI Model Systems and SC TBI registry data sets.  The vendor will then analyze the data and produce draft data tables, submit them to CDC and NIDRR for comments, and based on those comments, revise the tables and prepare a draft technical report.  They will then submit the draft report to CDC and NIDRR for additional comments, and then prepare and submit to CDC a final technical report.  The focus of the vendor’s role will be as an expert in analyzing TBI Model Systems and SC TBI Registry data.  
The data, technical report, study methods, and findings, derived from this contract will be a key component of a national conference demonstrating interagency collaboration on research into TBI, its underlying causes and risk factors, and outcomes among survivors.  The vendor will be responsible for convening an inter-agency workgroup comprised of experts in the field of TBI research.  This workgroup will team with the vendor and provide expert scientific consultation as well as collaboration in the area of program planning. The vendor must possess the unique ability to conduct both the scientific and programmatic aspects of this procurement.

<DESC>THIS IS AMENDMENT 0001 TO SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION RFQ W914NS-04-Q- 0199:

1) Is there a preference of hardware suppliers for the PCs?
A: No preference on hardware vendor (reliable vendors with good support are desired).

2) We would like to pre-configure the hardware and have burn in tests done before we deploy to Baghdad.
A: Pre-configuration is acceptable.

3) Regarding the tight delivery timeframe what happens if hardware is not available in a sufficient amount of time? Can we swap to other available hardware?
A:  There is no hardware available in-country; hardware will have to be from an acceptable vendor.

4) Is it correct that we only install one system in Baghdad and the other two systems are handed over with training to be deployed in the other two destinations?
A: One system will be installed in Baghdad.  The others will go to regional offices (probably Mosul and Basra).

5) Is the power supply sufficiently stable to operate PCs or do we need to provide hardware for this too?
A: Vendor should offer UPS with delivered system.  Facility should have capability to provide stable power and handle major outages.

6) Is it possible to access broadband internet, so that the system that is currently running can be demonstrated?
A: Yes; demonstrating a currently running system may be done prior to delivery by the successful contractor.

7) Are Virage/Idioma in any way preferred or is this open to other solutions? 
A: Open to other solutions that meet the requirement.

8) How long should the complaints archive be available?
A: Mandatory archiving period to be determined by ICMC licensing; presently, broadcasters required to maintain 30-day archives of output.

9) Do advertising, election or broadcast violations need to be auto-detected or is this done according to monitoring activities (key word search, complaint, etc?) 
A: Auto-detection and auto-indexing could help if the number of available analysts are lower than anticipated/planned, particularly during election campaign period.  Monitoring activities otherwise to be reactive rather than prescriptive/pro-active.   

10) Can voice samples be made available for the people that are of interest for the observers?
A: Direct voice samples unlikely; however, samples could be made from recorded output. Generally though, monitoring more likely to be based around grid (specific programmes, news bulletins etc) rather than target personalities.  

11) How many Analysts will access the system and do they need dedicated PCs from us or do they have existing PCs that we could configure for usage (Java for Internet Explorer and Real Media Player would need to be installed).
A: Difficult to ascertain at present time; ICMC management has option of determining full scope of monitoring activities. Number of analysts also likely to fluctuate (e.g. during election campaign period). Likely strength around 10 personnel. Numbers of PCs should be factored into total ICMC hardware requirements.     

12) How many of the 20 Stations are radio and how many TV?
A:  Likely ratio 15 TV, 5 radio.

All other terms and conditions remains the same.  The closing date of the RFQ remains unchanged.
