Vendor shall provide local24 hour service calls for repair services.Description of Use in ProjectThe purpose of this procurement is to obtain the ability to measure and characterizeoptical wave fronts over a 100 mm diameter aperture to an accuracy of /300.  Theinterferometer system is intended to allow Ames scientists to verify optical systemperformance in the ACE test bed, with the ultimate goal of producing a technology capableof directly imaging earth-like planets orbiting in the habitable zone around nearbystars.	The interferometer system will be placed in the optical path at different pointsto verify that the wave front is properly corrected.  Our beam size will be as large as100mm in some places, so the input aperture of the interferometer will need to be atleast that large, proper verification of the wave front also requires the use of a 100mmtransmission optical flat and a 100mm diameter transmission sphere. Each of theseaccessory components must have a surface quality of 1/20 wave.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon May 12, 2008.Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), contemplates awarding, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed price contract in accordance with FAR Part 15 for the storage and rotation of pediatric vaccines to be used as a national stockpile. CDC has purchased vaccines under a separate supply contract or delivery order, and the Contractor shall provide storage of the same at Contractor furnished sites. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered to be in the government's best interest due to the fact that Wyeth is the only company which has exclusive full capabilities to store and rotate the vaccines that they manufacture. Note 22 applies herein. The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1): FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible qualified small business and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes. Additional quantities of vaccines acquired under preceding or succeeding separate supply contracts or delivery orders may be added to the stockpile by modification to this contract. Material will be held at the contractor furnished storage site for subsequent delivery as required by the contract. The storage site shall be located at one or more domestic facility (i.e.) that is/are controlled by the Contractor. The Contractor shall only store the product in filled, labeled, ready-to-use containers in the stockpile. CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to this Request for Proposals (RFP). All questions/concerns about the RFP shall be submitted via e-mail to Gary Morgan at gmorgan1@cdc.gov. The complete solicitation package will be available and posted at this site for downloading when issued, approximately within 15 days. No telephone requests of the solicitation will be accepted. No hard copy of the solicitation package will be mailed. It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding the RFP on the Fedbizopps Website.

<DESC>The Office of International Affairs and Trade Relations (INATR), US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is acquiring hotel accommodations with conference facilities and related services for the purpose of conducting International Air Cargo Interdiction Training (IACIT) with Azerbaijan during the period of 6/13 to 6/22/2008. The party of participants is comprised of CBP employees, Contractors, and/or representatives from foreign governments, all working on official US Government business. Approximately 20 lodging rooms will be required during the conference period. See accompanying solicitation for details. 

High quality facilities and relating services are required for this event. Hotel with co-located conference facility must be located within a 30-mile radius of JFK International Airport using distance data from Google Maps, Mapquest, or similar utilities as a basis. Normal travel time between the hotel and the airport, during any time of the day (including rush hour) must not be longer than 60 minutes.

This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer/quotation that requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable.

CBP is a federal government agency and as such is exempt from most sales and occupancy taxes for goods and services it acquires directly, via purchase order as in this case. A NY State tax exemption form (ST-129) will be completed and submitted to the successful Contractor after award.

Quotations are being requested via the relating solicitation that has been uploaded at this website, RFQ HSBP1008Q1745. This is an RFQ issued in accordance with FAR Part 13. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-24) and the Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations (HSAR). It is the responsibility of the Offeror/Quoter to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions. This RFQ will be issued exclusively through this Government Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov). Future information about this acquisition including amendments to this procurement requirement will also be distributed through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.

The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this RFQ to the responsible vendor whose quotation conforming to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors  considered. Responses will be evaluated on the basis of best value. CBP expects to acquire the accommodation services at nightly rates not exceeding the current GSA per diem level of $159.00 for Nassau County.

In reviewing the solicitation document, readers will note selected sections of the text that are highlighted in yellow, which indicates that the affected text is either very important, a change from past similar acquisitions, or both.

NOTE: Offerors/Quoters must be registered at WWW.CCR.GOV with a status of ACTIVE in order to be eligible for award and must be in compliance with the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (PL101-391). Uploaded files include the following: 1) solicitation document (HSBP1008Q1745) in PDF format; 2) Bid Schedule in Excel format, and pages 3-22 of the solicitation in MS Word format (RFQ Docs).

<DESC>The Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal to conduct research on the Safety Impacts of Speed Limiter Device Installation on Commercial Motor Vehicles.   The anticipated completion date of the research is 24 months after date of award.  In late 2006, FMCSA received separate, but similar, petitions for rulemaking from (1) the American Trucking Association, and (2) RoadSafe America, a public safety interest group, and a group of nine motor carriers to require devices that would (a) limit the speed of trucks with a Gross Vehicle Weight Raring (GVWR) of greater than 26,000 pounds to no more than 68 miles-per-hour (mph), (b) prohibit owners and operators from adjusting the speed limiting devices in affected vehicles in a way that enables the vehicles to exceed a speed of 68 mph.  The petitioners contend that reducing speed related  crashes involving trucks is critical to the safety mission of both FMCSA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and that the proposed requirements are necessary in order to reduce the number and severity of crashes involving large trucks.  The objective of this research is to determine the impact of motor carriers implementing speed limiter programs by the motor carrier industry.  These can be economic, through increased fuel economy and reduced maintenance, as well as related to safety through a reduction in the number and severity of crashes.  The study envisioned is a before-after evaluation using an advanced methodology to control for a number of confounding factors.  Data will need to be collected from carriers that have implemented speed limiters in recent years and also from carriers that have not implemented speed limiters to control changes over time that have influenced highway safety.  Another method of conducting this study would be to compare within each motor carrier the impact on performance before and after speed limiter program is implemented.  A third possible comparison of carriers that implement speed limiters to carriers that have not implemented speed limiter programs during the same period will provide a control for changes over time have influenced highway safety.  The contractor will be expected to submit their proposed methodology upon submission of their proposal.

The contract will be a Labor Hour contract.   The government intends to award a contract for a base period of one year (date of award and one year option year.  The Statement of Work will address additional technical requirements and the opening and closing dates will appear in the RFP.

Offerors will be asked to provide a written proposal and an oral presentation.  Instructions will be provided in the RFP.

It is anticipated that the solicitation/RFP will be released on or about Friday, May 16, 2008.

<DESC>Work consists of roadway excavation and embankment to restore the road grade across 5 stream channels.  Furnishing and placing concrete planks and jersey barriers (to serve as cut-off walls), and furnishing and placing riprap aprons in the stream channel.  Riprap may be gathered along the project road, considerable effort is necessary to gather and sort riprap.  The project road is difficult access for full size vehicles.  Selection of appropriate construction equipment may be limited by the road condition.  Only minimal improvements to the road are allowable to accommodate construction equipment access and subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.  Staging areas for equipment and materials is difficult since the road is located in a steep narrow canyon.  Opportunities to detour traffic are not available.  The project is located on the Fishlake National Forest.  A Forest Visitor/Travel Map may be helpful to determine the proximity of the project from a larger prospective.  A Forest Visitor/Travel Map may be acquired from the Fishlake National Forest.  This Project will be uploaded approximately May 7, 2008, and will be set aside for Emerging Small Business only!!!
This project will be estimated between $25,000.00 to $100,000.00.

<CONTACT>Carol A. Wood, Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer, Phone 301-975-8172, Fax 301-975-8904, Email carol.wood@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/Acquisition Management   Division (AMD), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, on behalf of the Manufacturing Metrology Division,  with Mettler-Toledo, Inc. of Columbus, OH, for the installation of an existing Mettler-Toledo vacuum-compatible balance into an existing vacuum chamber.

The Mass & Force Group of the Manufacturing Metrology Division in the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory at NIST maintains and disseminates the SI unit of mass, the Kilogram.   As such it provides to the 50 States, state and federal agencies, as well as private entities and individuals and sometimes foreign entities, a calibration service which disseminates the unit of mass based on the National Kilogram Standard of Mass.

The mass standard is artifact-based which is susceptible to damage or destruction.  New alternative methods for the realization of the kilogram leading to a non-artifact-based system are currently under development and they require mass measurements in vacuum.  

The installation of an existing10-kilogram vacuum balance into a NIST-supplied vacuum chamber system is a crucial part of developing the required vacuum mass measurement methods.

The Contractor shall provide all labor, materials and expertise necessary for the installation of NISTs existing Mettler-Toledo AX10005V 10-kilogram vacuum-compatible balance (vacuum balance) into NISTs vacuum chamber system (chamber).  The vacuum balance must remain operational according to manufacturers specifications upon completion of the installation into the chamber.  The vacuum chamber is divided into two chambers  an upper and lower chamber.  The vacuum balance must be installed in the upper chamber and tested to meet the specified requirements on-site at NISTs Mass and Force Group facilities.

This requirement is being procured on a sole source basis.  Sole source determination is based on the following:

The contemplated effort is a follow-on acquisition to continue development on a highly specialized piece of equipment as described in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.  
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in
(A)  Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered 
through competition, or
(B)  Unacceptable delays fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).

The vacuum-compatible balance was awarded via a competitive request for quotation.  Award was made in September 2005.  The requirement to install the vacuum-compatible balance into the chamber was required by the statement of work for the balance.  The Contractor agreed to complete the installation into the vacuum chamber via a follow-on purchase order.  Mettler-Toledo has consulted with NIST during the in-house development of the vacuum chamber.  Mettler has specialized knowledge regarding the chamber and the required installation.

Furthermore, the vacuum-compatible balance is currently under warranty with Mettler Toledo.  To have an alternate source perform this work would void the manufacturers warranty.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by April 28, 2008, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Andrew L. Maine, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-451-7364, Fax 301-402-0178, Email Mainea@od.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA), intends to negotiate a nine-year contract with Coriell Institute for Medical Research to provide support for the maintenance of an Aged Cell Bank.

The Aging Cell Repository was established at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research (then known as Institute for Medical Research) in June, 1974, by the Aging Branch, NICHD (later to become the Institute on Aging) through contract N01 AG 4 2865. The repository continued at the same location from January 1, 1980 through January 31, 1986 as contract N01 AG 0 2100. The contract was competed and continued at the same location from February 1986 through January 31, 1991 as contract N01 AG 6 2109. The contract was competed and continued at the same location from February 1991 through January 31, 2000 as contract N01 AG 1 2101, and again from 2000 to 2009 under contract N01-AG-0-2101.

The specific requirement to be accomplished by this contract is for the Contractor to continue to establish, characterize, store and distribute normal and genetically marked cell lines for aging research.  The importance of this resource lies in the unique collection of cell lines for aging research and the research opportunities they present. 

Statutory authority: The appropriate statutory authority is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.

The cited authority is applicable because due to the risk of moving the repository, and the costs associated with such a move, there is only one responsible source that will satisfy agency requirements. Coriell Institute for Medical Research has the highest possible qualifications to carry out the work in this contract, as exemplified by their past performance over the past 35 years.

<DESC><p>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service, (NMFS) &nbsp;National Marine Mammal Laboratory, (NMML) located in Seattle, WA&nbsp;require a contractor&nbsp; for the Study of Oceanographic Conditions and Bowhead Whale Prey Distributions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Background<br />The Beaufort Sea Shelf is a critical feeding area for migrating bowhead whales, particularly during the fall migration from their summer grounds in the Canadian Arctic to their overwintering grounds in the northern Bering Sea. A large research program has been developed to evaluate the importance of this area; this program is called the "Bowhead Whale Feeding Study" or BOWFEST. Many institutions are involved in this study, and the program is coordinated by the National Marine Mammal Laboratory. A component of this research program involves a description of relationships between the formation and distribution of bowhead whale prey (zooplankton) aggregations, oceanographic conditions, and bowhead whale distributions and feeding behavior (e.g., diving patterns relative to prey distribution) in the Western Beaufort Sea. Oceanographic and atmospheric conditions impact the composition, distribution, and availability of plankton prey for the bowhead whale.</p>
<p>Tasks</p>
<p>Sampling area<br />The sampling area is over the Western Beaufort Sea oceanic shelf. Transects will be run from the shore to about 72&#61616;N in an area north of Barrow, Alaska, and east to ~152 &deg;E.</p>
<p>Sampling season<br />The research will be conducted through most of August and the first half of September 2008.</p>
<p>Sampling scheme<br />Oceanographic moorings will be deployed at predetermined locations during the first part of August. This will be done in close cooperation with the North Slope Borough and their research team. The moorings will help monitor shelf/slope exchanges that are believed to influence the availability of zooplankton.</p>
<p>In addition, oceanographic sampling will be conducted along transects from the shore across the oceanographic shelf to the shelf-break using a 43' boat. High vertical-resolution oceanographic sampling will be conducted along several shore-to-shelf-break transects. The sampling will include data to determine whale prey distributions. Ultimately, these observations will lead to a greater understanding of the marine environment on the oceanic shelf. These results will provide important data for ecological modeling and predictive efforts. Such information is critical to development of mitigation associated with potential future oil and gas development in this region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000</p>
<p>The Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003. After this date, NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at www.dnb.com/eupdate or by phone at (800) 333-0505. All contractors are also required to complete online Representations and Certifications at HTTP://ORCA.BPN.GO</p>

<CONTACT>Jenetta Langston 850-235-5362 , or Contracting Officer Wanda Cutchin at 850-636-6140.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Sea-Bird Electronics (SBE) Incorporated, 1808 136th Place NE, Bellevue, Washington for the acquisition of six (6) SBE 19-plus Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) Optics-Ready Profilers (NAVOCEANO configuration).  The CTD systems being acquired are urgently needed to support mission essential operations aboard Navy military helicopters and ships supporting Mine Warfare (MIW) operations.  Because optical mine hunting systems are migrating to the fleet, the U. S. Navy has an immediate need to increase their optics/CTD sensor package deployments on military platforms.  These sensors provide data in support of other sensors used for oceanography, hydrography, ASW, home land security, MIW, Naval Special Warfare, and many other mission related tasks.  This requirement is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons:  (1) Sea-Bird is the only provider of a CTD that meets all of the U.S. Navy requirements; (2) Any changes to these requirements would adversely impact the mission of NAVOCEANO and our support to the MIW community; (3) The U.S. Navy has an enormous inventory of the same/similar Sea Bird sensors being purchased in this contract. Changing vendors or instrumentation would call for a significant increase in funding to re-engineer current CTD/optics systems and which would also require additional maintenance dollars and training programs to ensure data collection and database population; (4) Sea-Bird has the required expertise to provide necessary calibrations and repairs to these commercially off the shelf (COTS) units; (5) Staying with COTS available instrumentation provides the greatest financial benefit for the government.  The Request for Quote number is N61331-08-T-8010.  The expected award date will be on or around 8 May 2008. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334519 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  The resultant contract shall be a firm-fixed price purchase order.

<DESC>The Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) Philadelphia, PA will be soliciting a proposal for spares support of the E/A-18G Advanced Navigational System (ANAV). 
The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Boeing Company (MDC/Boeing) will be solicited for this requirement via the FIRST (F/A-18 Integrated Readiness Support Team) program. 
The FIRST Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract provides spares availability, asset repair management, engineering support, and integrated logistics support (ILS) of all F/A-18 Aircraft variants. The FIRST program demands aggressive pursuit of system reliability improvements through effective configuration and obsolescence management, technology insertion, and innovative product and support improvements. 
The estimated $ value of the EA-18G ANAV spares is $1,712,000.00.
The EA-18G ANAV requirement is restricted to MDC/Boeing, the aircraft prime manufacturer, because MDC/Boeing is the only source that possesses the full range of technical data, much of which is proprietary, and other capabilities necessary to perform the effort. Further, MDC/Boeing is considered to be the only source that is capable of providing the required range of integrated program support. See Note 22*****

<DESC>The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296) states that DHS S&T will support basic and applied homeland security research to promote revolutionary changes in technologies; advance the development, testing and evaluation, and deployment of critical homeland security technologies; and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that would address homeland security vulnerabilities.  Pursuant to this mission the Chemical Biological Division (CBD) seeks technologies to prevent, detect, and defend against chemical and biological attacks.  In addition, the division is charged with pursuing research to improve response and restoration, conduct threat risk assessments, and invest in bioforensics research and development.  The focus of this BAA is in the area of biological toxin detection assay research and development.

A major requirement for Department of Homeland Security is the development of bioassays that give high-confidence detection of Biothreat agents.  The goal of this research program is to develop Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assays (ELISA) for the detection of biological toxins.  In order to mount a rapid and appropriate response to the release of a biological agent (toxin), the threat needs to be quickly identified and characterized.  This information is critical to allow decision makers to take the best course of action to most efficiently characterize, respond, and employ countermeasures following an incident.  Furthermore, an effort to standardize the analysis methods, techniques, and instrument platforms is ongoing, and is a major goal of the Department.

Please see attached BAA for :
Assay Requirements for Ricin, Abrin Toxin, and Botulinum Neuro-Toxins;  
Tasks/Deliverables; and
Cost proposal template.

White papers are due no later than 4:30 pm (local Eastern Time), May 7, 2008.

Vendors who currently have an ARA agreement will need to provide a new proposal under this solicitation. Once this ARA solicitation is awarded and inspections completed, the current ARA will expire. Terms and conditions and the scope of work under the ARA program have changed, so it is important for offerors to read this solicitation. Interagency Fire management activities are no longer under the ARA program.

NOTE: Small helicopters supporting interagency fire management activities must be under an exclusive use or on call (OC) contract if the operator wishes to do business with DOI for fire management activities. If you operate these types of aircraft and are interested in continuing your for fire support to the DOI under DOI procurement systems, you will need to submit a proposal under 8008-05, which is currently open for bids with the same closing date as this ARA solicitation.  If an individual aviation vendor holds a DOI ARA and the same services can be provided via the on-call helicopter contract, the ARA may be cancelled.  We plan on eliminating duplicate procurements when possible.  It is a requirement that any successful awardee must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award being made.  It is the offeror's responsibility to ensure registration is accurate and valid.  Solicitation information will be available through the FEDBIZOPPS site (found under Department of the Interior, Office of the Secretary, NBC, Aviation Management Headquarters, Boise, ID) and at http://amd.nbc.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Special Operations Acquisition and Logistics (SOAL) Center intends to solicit proposals to acquire professional information technology (IT) services to satisfy requirements for the design, engineering, development, and integration of the Special Operations Resource Business Information System (SORBIS).  This includes development and documentation of business processes, procedures, and/or business process re-engineering.  SORBIS will be accomplished through implementation of a modern Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that integrates all data and business processes of disparate legacy resource (i.e., financial) and acquisition program information management systems used throughout USSOCOM, both internal and external, into an integrated unified system that uses a common Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) material solution.  This integration effort will be supported through the utilization of industry enterprise resource planning best practices and compliance with Federal, Department of Defense, and USSOCOM regulations and guidelines.  It is anticipated that a single award of an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (per FAR 16.504 criteria) contract will be awarded that will allow for a modular development approach.  Integration and technical services will be provided over a five year period.  Attached is the Statement of Objectives (SOO) for SORBIS which delineates the goals of the program. 

Potential qualified sources are encouraged to submit a White Paper detailing their capabilities, capacity, and directly related work experience in successfully performing design, engineering, development, and integration of multiple IT legacy financial and acquisition resource management systems, preferably involving multiple legacy Department of Defense (DoD) resource management systems using different platforms and software/hardware applications, where the work is considered highly complex, where limited technical requirements and business development and operations data exists, and where business process re-engineering was involved.  Finally, the White Paper shall provide a concise and detailed response as to how the company would meet the Critical Objectives as stated in the DRAFT SOO.

The White Paper information should identify the company name, address, point of contact phone number and email address, company size, status under the identified North American Industry Classification System code, and Data Universal Numbering System number.  The White Paper should also identify prime and subcontractor relationships (i.e., percentage of work performed between prime and subcontractors).  The White Paper shall be a maximum of five pages in length (12 pitch type, 1 inch margins).

Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.

Please submit technical questions in writing to Mr. Scott Brown, SORBIS Program Manager, via email to: browns@socom.mil. Contracting questions shall directed at Madeline Baumgartner via email to: madeline.baumgartner@socom.mil.

<CONTACT>Lisandra Torres E-mail Only
<DESC>This Presolicitation Notice is being issued in advance of Solicitation No. M67854-08-R-3025, which replaces Solicitation No. M67854-08-R-3003, which was cancelled on 16 April 2008.  This is a Presolicitation Notice only; no proposals are being requested at this time.  The Marine Corps System Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense Systems, has a requirement for General Purpose Shelters with 512 to 650 square feet of floor space.  These shelters are to provide environmental protection for the United States Marine Corps field forces during the entire spectrum of military operations.  Shelters shall include the following requirements: they shall be mobile, durable, terrain-adaptable, all-weather, lightweight and have the ability to be quickly erected and struck and be suitable for use in the wide range of environmental conditions encountered during military operations.  The estimated quantity is a maximum of 3,400 shelters.  This commercial procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside under authority of FAR Part 19.502-2.  The NAICS code is 314912, Canvas and Related Product Mills, with a size standard of 500.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the government, considering price and other factors.  
The shelters will primarily be evaluated against stringent Go/No-Go criteria.  These criteria are snow load, rain intrusion, wind load, detectability, and flame resistance.  Shelters that fail to meet one or more of the requirements stated in the forthcoming solicitation will be eliminated from the competition.  The Government will use certified test data to verify snow load, rain intrusion and wind load.  The Government will use certified test data and exterior fabric certifications (i.e. opacity) from the fabric manufacturers for detectability (including blackout capability and near infrared signature).  The Government will use certifications from the fabric manufacturers to verify flame resistance for the following component fabrics: exterior material, liner, plenum and floor.  Test methods will be identified in the forthcoming solicitation.  All certified test data/test reports and certifications required MUST be submitted with the offerors proposal.  The test data/test reports and certifications the offeror submits as part of the written proposal shall CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE that the proposed shelter meets all elements of these Go/No-Go criteria, as well as other requirements of the solicitation.  If the offeror proposes a modified shelter design/model different from that reflected in the certified test/data reports and certifications and/or an alternate test method/certification than the methods/certifications identified, the offeror shall clearly explain any and all differences between the two.  Such detailed explanation shall include why the submitted test data/certifications are technically relevant to the requirements and why additional testing on the proposed shelter is not required.  If the test data/certifications and/or the explanation/justification submitted fails to satisfactorily address or meet these criteria, the offeror will be eliminated from consideration for award. 
Evaluation factors in addition to the Go/No-Go criteria will also be set forth in the forthcoming solicitation.  It is anticipated that Solicitation No. M67854-08-R-3025 will be issued in May 2008 and will be posted on the internet at the Federal Business Opportunities website located at the following address:     http://www.fedbizopps.gov, and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at http://www.neco.navy.mil.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation, but rather a Request for Information.  The Information Technology, E-Commerce and Commercial Contracting Center  West (ITEC4-W), located at Fort Huachuca, AZ is seeking input from potential sources that can provide 3D Face Model Generator/Visualizer and 180 degree face recognition capabilities for BAT. The 3D Face Model Generator allows for the creation of 3D models of faces from multiple source images.  The 3D models may be used to output videos or image sequences for novel presentation of image data, or more effective visual communication. The 3D Face Model Generator/Visualizer shall comprise of automated core features generation for -45, +45,-90, +90 degree labeled photos, manual core feature insertion, conditional automatic face features detection given core features, automatic face profile detection for frontal and -90, +90 degree labeled photos, 3D face model generation from up to 5 multiple photo views and 3D face model texturing based on frontal labeled photos.  Interested parties shall submit a capabilities statement addressing the following items:<BR><BR>"	A 2D to 3D Face Model Generator that utilizes up to five views of the face <BR>"	A facial biometric enrollment module with 2D-3D technology for BATS with +/- 45 degree facial yaw capability as well as enrollment from profile imagery capability.  The enrollment module will include Automatic Face Signature generation from multiple labeled photographs including frontal and -45, 45,-90, +90 degree photos. <BR>"	A facial biometric identification module for BAT  allowing for 95% identification rate at 1% False Accept Rate (FAR) against a watch list containing 5 photos for each gallery enrolled (containing 2- 90 degree profiles, 2- 45 degree images, 1 frontal) for frontal probes (2 eyes in image).  The facial identification module/functionality will include 2D-3D normalization for pose and lighting to optimize performance on uncontrolled data.  <BR>"	A second profile based facial biometric identification module for BAT allowing for 90% identification rate at 1% False Accept Rate (FAR) against a watch list containing 5 photos for each gallery enrolled (containing 2- 90 degree profiles, 2- 45 degree images, 1 frontal) for profile probes (1 eye in image).  The facial identification module/functionality shall include 2D-3D normalization for pose and lighting to optimize performance on uncontrolled data.<BR>"	A Video/IP Video interface for the facial biometric functionality of BATS compatible with the 2D-3D facial identification and facial biometric enrollment components. The Video/IP Video interface shall integrate with the User Interface to allow live tracking, face selection, face submission to identification system, face submission to enrollment system, and match result display.<BR>"	A client User Interface for the identification, enrollment and video components to be integrated with BAT.  The client user interface will be integrated with the standalone BAT client.  <BR>"	A web client User Interface for the identification, enrollment and video components to be integrated with BAT.  <BR>"	Software Installation <BR><BR>Background. As a part of ongoing nation building efforts dictated by Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom (OIF and OEF), DoD has an acute need to achieve identity dominance, that is, the capability to conclusively identify detainees, intelligence sources, host nation worker candidates, and other persons of interest. Obtaining both biometrics and biographical data and enrolling individuals in a database has been the approach taken with the Biometrics Automated Toolset (BAT). There are approximately 1500 BAT clients in use in OIF, OEF, the National Ground Intelligence Center and in Major Commands (MACOM) and Combat Commands (COCOM) worldwide.  They are networked by approximately 75 servers. The BAT system currently captures three biometrics measurements: fingerprint, face and iris. The 3D manipulation would normalize captured faces where the pose is some deviation from straight on, either rotated left or right or tilted up or down. The normalization process manipulates the actual captured image so as to effect x=0, y=0, z=0. Once normalized via the 3D software, facial recognition software can be effectively applied to identify the face. This 3D normalization process facilitates covert applications  in which faces are captured unknowingly, and/or at less than ideal angles (Uncontrolled Imagery). 3D normalization also facilitates success rates of facial capture and recognition normally degraded by environmental conditions such as high ambient light as well as physical features partially obstructing the face, such as a branch.  The matching algorithms which benefit from the normalization process must also take into account other 3D information of the face, such as curves and volumes, to provide a more accurate and robust identification result. <BR><BR>Interested firms should provide a solution for 3-D facial capture and recognition.  Also interested firms should provide information stating whether this will be a new prototype or equipment currently offered commercially.  The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest and capabilities of firms who can support this requirement.  If you believe your firm can perform this type of support, the government is interested in receiving a technical capability statement.  Technical capability statements can be submitted in your own format and shall be 5 pages or less.  Interested firms should submit their written responses to the Contract Specialist, Cynthia Hall, via email:  cynthia.m.hall@netcom.army.mil, no later than 6 May 2008.  Any questions or concerns, please contact the Contract Specialist at 520-533-0363 or the Contracting Officer, Jadie Russell at 520-533-1694 or Technical Point of Contact (only for technical related questions), Matt Malanowski, 520-533-4665. This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>Fort Hood Texas is looking for possible sources to provide the following services.  Interest can be expressed via email only at leeann.burke@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>The contractor shall provide rail car recovery and loading services (including preparation for shipment) of six DODX railcars and all associated equipment (trucks, wheels, chains, miscellaneous pieces and scrap) onto other DODX rail cars and into Gondola cars for shipment to  a designated repair facility. Contractor must have personnel fully trained in derailment rail car recovery. Additionally the contractor must have the ability to cross over existing track without damaging it (soft shoe equipment with side boom lifting capability).<BR><BR>C.5.1.  The contractor shall provide derailment / rail car recovery (including all ancillary equipment), loading and securing of loads, cleanup of scrap materials,  track repair (if needed), certification of loads and site remediation if needed. To accomplish this activity, the contractor shall perform the following tasks:<BR><BR>C.5.2.  Remove damaged rail cars and associated equipment from their current resting places onto other functional DODX 40000 Series rail cars (provided by the Army)<BR><BR>C.5.3 Damaged rail cars will be mounted upright on the carrying car; blocking with wood to avoid metal-to-metal contact, prevent rocking from side to side, and permit access to chain tie down assembly turnbuckles.  Then run as many pairs of chain tie down assemblies as deemed necessary from outside anchor channel, up through the container pedestal pockets of the damaged car, and hook to each other across deck of damaged car. The working load limit of chain tie down assemblies is 13,750 lbs.  The weight of the cars with trucks is approximately 100,000 lbs.  (Even though the trucks will be loaded separately, using the weight of the car with trucks to be conservative produces a requirement for 100000/13750 = 7.27 = 8 chain tie down assemblies per car using DODX 40000 series cars.)<BR><BR>C5.4 All ancillary rail car equipment and scrap will be loaded into Gondola Cars (trucks, axles, springs, chains, binders, brake wheels, etc.)<BR><BR>

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a sources sought synopsis for written information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  
The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Norfolk, Virginia is seeking for information and planning purposes, qualified and experienced sources for a feasibility study relating to the standardization of Lab Management software suite across the entire DOD Optical Enterprise.
The Naval Ophthalmic Support and Training Activity, Yorktown, Virginia is responsible for improving and standardizing optical fabrication services throughout the Department of Defense (DOD).  The DOD Optical Fabrication Enterprise (OFE) is a Tri-service entity consisting of 26 labs world-wide, providing optical fabrication support for the Armed Forces and other federal agencies.  The OFE's mission is to provide key elements of vision readiness and optical support to the Armed Forces of the United States.  These elements include the manufacturing of eyeglasses, protective mask inserts and specialty lenses.  The OFE currently fills over 1.2 million prescriptions for eyewear per year.												The DoD Optical Fabrication Enterprise (OFE) is performing a feasibility study relating to the standardization of Lab Management Software suite (LMS) across the entire DoD Optical Enterprise.  The primary focus of the study is to determine if a single vendor can provide a standardized Lab Management Software (LMS) suite across the OFE in an effort to streamline processes and to improve the OFEs vision for improving customer service.
This study will encompass the development, deployment, timelines, and support of an automated optical fabrication management system for the OFE.  Key features of OFAMS involve integration and interfaces with current SRTS legacy and the planned SRTS2/AHLTA DoD electronic eyeglass order entry and order management system, logistic (DMLSS), and a wide variety of OFE operated equipment (Blocker, generator, edger, etc.) and allow for an optical order to be received from an external customer, validated, tracked, calculated, manufactured, verified, and shipped to an external customer.
Standardizing the OFE LMS suites will enhance the optical device order entry and tracking systems currently in place.  Key enhancements include:	Detailed job tracking that allows users to know current and past statuses of the job as well as who was involved in key fabrication steps and the equipment used during fabrication.	Integration/interfaces with internal and external DoD applications to update job statuses, initiate inventory management, perform order validation and error identification, and share key order information.	Highly granular and highly detailed user friendly reporting functions to provide metrics, alerts and other user defined reports in common exportable formats; such as Excel, CVS, delimited, SQL, Crystal Reports, etc.	Barcode and other job identification and tracking such as RFID functions to minimize keystrokes.	Integration with user defined optical fabrication related equipment to allow for two-way information exchange required for fabrication, tracking, and quality verification.	Inventory verification to ensure material pulled for each job is correct.	A graphical user interface (GUI) that is highly configurable by the user to allow for all current and past jobs to be identified and recalled according to user defined sorts.  This master order management screen allows the user to view all or specific subsets of jobs and recall a complete history for each job as needed.  Alerts for key user defined situations that are integrated into the order management screen.	Comply with applicable MHS AIS security, patient privacy and data transmission requirements	Help desk and system change request process for ongoing system maintenance and enhancements
Interested sources are invited to respond to this sources sought synopsis by submitting a technical proposal and cost proposal for their system.  A list of their system's capabilities, standards compliance, interoperability with robotics and automation equipment.  If feasible, a demonstration video, computer animation or screenshots of their LMS suite's user interface should be provided.  Some areas to consider: Design, Development, Customization per lab (26 labs world-wide), Graphical User Interface (Required), Support, Maintenance, Upgrades, Security, Fault Tolerance, Metrics, Granular & Custom Reporting, RFID Tracking, Shipping, Single-Vision, Multi-Vision, Progressives, Facilities, Manpower, Interfaces, Data Flow, HIPPA, Privacy Act, System Hardware.  Responses should be e-mailed to both Patty Black at patricia.black@med.navy.mil and to Maria Swift at maria.swift@navy.mil by 31 May 2008 at 4:30 p.m. EST.  This is not a request for proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

<p>The OFCMS is the data entry tool which provides compliance officers with an automated method to submit compliance information and case investigation milestones. OFCCP compliance officers in the field use OFCMS as the primary means to track the progress of investigations of federal contractors.</p>
<p>The OFEIS is the primary reporting vehicle for the integrated OFIS. It is the data visualization and reporting tool that accesses data reported from the User Community through the OFCMS. The OFEIS provides for the visualization of data in both graphical and tabular formats. In addition, the OFEIS provides the capability to extract data from the Server Database to the User PC's resident MS Office applications for further analysis. In continuing with the long-term OFIS development strategy, the OFEIS is continuously being enhanced in an iterative manner. This integrated information processing and reporting system is the cornerstone for OFCCP's current and future Information System development.</p>
<p>OFADM is an administrative module, developed primarily for user management, to maintain a list of authorized users and their levels of access privileges. It also includes administrative forms and templates. OFADM has merged with OFCMS.</p>
<p>The OFIS is a Client/Server software product (that has recently been transitioned to a secure CITRIX Environment. This environment provides a "Virtual" Desktop to the OFCCP User Community and the OFIS is now only accessible to the User Community through this environment). It provides information, on a business daily basis, on both the compliance evaluations and a complaint investigation conducted by the Program, and also provides consistency through standardization of processes throughout the country.</p>
<p>The OFIS is an element of the ESA General Support System environment. The ESA GSS environment consists of an architecture made up of various components shared by all entities within the organization. Components include Desktop PCs, Notebook PCs, Multi-Function Devices, LANs and various servers providing a multitude of services. The entire infrastructure is tied together by a Wide Area Network which establishes the distributed environment allowing users access to common services as well as mission-related applications required as part of their job functions.</p>
<p>The OFIS resides on the ESA GSS central database server at the primary and disaster recovery centralized data centers. The centralized data centers also provide Network File Services (NFS) and large Network Attached storage, which provides Windows file services. Both UNIX authentication servers and Windows domain servers provide for authentication depending on which protocol is being accessed.</p>
<p>The Desktop/Notebook PCs consist of Intel-based hardware running the Windows XP operating system. All Desktop/Notebook PCs are loaded using a standard configuration that includes various client software such as a COTS office automation suite; anti-virus software; ODBC/Native drivers for database connectivity; file sharing and printing utilities software (for both UNIX and Windows); and, a standard Internet browser. In addition, all Notebook PCs contain modems and Remote Access Software to connect to the network via a LAN, dial-up, wireless, or broadband service (where available).</p>
<p>Shared print services are provided using Multi-Function devices that are available to the OFCCP User Community in each of our office locations. These Multi-Function devices can be accessed using UNIX LPR or Windows printing protocol.</p>
<p>The OFIS client applications are currently written in Borland Delphi 7 and are designed to run on standard ESA Windows XP workstations. The data is stored in three DB2 databases located at the National Office, at DOL HQ in Washington, D.C. The OFCCP Application Development Team is responsible for developing and maintaining the client applications and the structure of the databases. The ESA/ Office of Management, Administration, and Planning (OMAP)/ Division of Information Technology Management &amp; Services (DITMS) is responsible for maintaining the physical security of the databases and for performing daily backups of the data. See Appendix B for the description of the current system.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Office of the Program Manager Close Combat Systems (OPMCCS),Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources to develop a Tactical Explosive System (TES). Ideally by grouping together functionally similar demolition capabilities (e.g. road cratering, urban breaching, etc.) and seeking the latest in technology advances, the Government  can focus on available systems that can be modified, combined or tailored to do multiple demolition missions.The Government is looking for input from industry on the technologies that they are currently developing, have developed or are familiar with such that it can be applied towards developing a family of weapon systems (including explosive material, fuzing design, etc) that would meet the broad technical requirements as delineated below.      a.  A manportable, explosive system that rapidly and in a single process, without the need for detailed demolitions calculations, can be employed to 1) create a road crater or  2) breach a reinforced concrete wall or steel door from a closer safe distance or 3) knock out a bridge pier.
    b.  A manportable, low-order explosive system that rapidly and in a single process, without the need for detailed demolition calculations, can be employed to 1) destroy munition caches without causing them to go high order or 2) destroy an IED without causing it to go high order or 3) destroy a munition on a road or airfield without causing major damage to the road or airfield.
    c.  A one-manportable demolition system that rapidly can be employed and detonated to create a footpath for dismounted Soldiers through complex obstacles (minefields and wire).
    d.  A manportable, standoff breaching capability for concrete bunkers, reinforced walls and other hardened buildings that can also be used to excavate/detonate deep buried IEDs down to a depth of at least two feet, desired to 10 feet or more.
    e.  A manportable, multi-purpose demolition than can be configured as required to do numerous Engineer demolition missions and reduce the number of systems in the Armys inventory.
    f.  A two-manportable, scalable/modular and tailorable demolition system that allows Soldiers to tailor the amount of explosive, warhead type, initiation method or other variables as dictated by mission requirements with a reduced employment time, minimal training time, greater precision in targeting and effect with reduced safe standoff distance and collateral damage.  The goal would be a kit of common components with multiple uses and configurations that could be carried inside a squad vehicle.
The TES shall be transportable in its shipping container by external rotary wing aircraft, UH-60 and CH-47, and be compatible with transportation assets organic to the Force.  The TES shall be transportable by other water, rail, ground and other fixed wing air transportation assets. The containerized TES shall have tie-down and sling points to secure the container in all air, water, and ground transportation vehicles.  There shall be appropriate fire and safety placards to identify hazards associated with TES components.
The modular charges can be either hand-emplaced or remotely delivered and will provide a versatile, selectable effect capability.  The TES will be an explosive capability that is small, precise, safe, lightweight and multi-functional, compared to the predecessor systems.
Responses should include their current business structures: (a) name of Company-include contact persons name, company address, telephone numbers (voice and fax), e-mail address, (b) Company size (i.e. large, foreign, small disadvantaged, veteran owned, woman owned, etc).   Included in the submission should be current major manufacturing processes, critical skills and equipment, and current production capabilities, which should include the maximum production rate attainable and minimum sustaining rate. Also identified should be the organizations facilities, equipment, unique capabilities, environmental concerns, storage, shipping, receiving and other support functions, such as testing capabilities for conducting acceptance testing of the end product. 
This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government. The Government implies no intention or opportunity to acquire funding to support current or future production efforts. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.<BR><BR>Product Manager Forward Looking Infrared (PM FLIR) is conducting market research to determine the status of currently available products and technologies capable of providing an affordable low cost materiel solution for a 360 degree situational awareness program called the Close Surveillance Support System (CS3).  The CS3 system is comprised of both A-Kits (platform installation and integration items) and B-Kits (CS3 system components) which are considered to be the critical elements in assessing the CS3 programs affordability.  The CS3 system is intended to meet increased mission requirements associated with Survivability, Mobility and Lethality as outlined in Capability Development  Documents (CDD) for the Stryker Brigade Combat Team (Operational Requirements Documents to CDD conversion, 14 Dec 2007) and the various Combat Vehicle customer requirements (PM Heavy Brigade Combat Team and Marine Corps, 7 Dec 2007).  Current and future Army doctrine requires this capability to conduct sustained operations, 24 hours a day, during all weather and light conditions, executed over extended distances.  Combat Vehicles are a vital element of all types of units.  This capability is needed to allow the users/operators to maintain situational awareness while under armor during day and nighttime operations and during times of impaired visibility (fog, smoke, and dust). CS3 is not intended to be used as targeting system for fire control. PM FLIR is interested in technology solutions with readiness levels that can support production and fielding within six months of contract award.<BR><BR>System Description:  CS3 is a collection of color visible and Infrared (IR) cameras mounted around the top and sides of the vehicle platform, user interface hardware, and a digital recording capability integrated into the vehicle.  The CS3 will support independent multiple user capability and provide various operators with a 360 degree cumulative Horizontal Field of Regard while under armor, in day, night and degraded visibility conditions, particularly in urban and complex terrain with a Vertical Field of View of approximately 30 degrees.  The CS3 is intended to provide the operators the ability to 1) Observe immediate area around the vehicle; 2) Identify potential threats; 3) Prevent vehicle injury to dismounted soldiers; 4) Prevent vehicle injury to non-combatants; 5) Improve vehicle maneuvering; 6) Provide Vehicle commander and driver with day/night visibility in all directions vehicle can move; 7) Allow Vehicle commander and driver to scan intersections without exposing entire vehicle; 8) Allow driver to back-up without assistance.  The CS3 system is planned for installation on Army and USMC ground based platforms such as the Stryker FOV and the M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR>---------------<BR>A.	 General Information<BR><BR>	Europe Region seeks approval to initiate the standardization process for Anti-Embolism Stockings for its 55 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical facilities in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Southwest Asia.  Standardization for this product line, Anti-Embolism Stockings, represents a previously standardized product line initiative for the Europe Region. The Europe Region originally completed this product line for standardization in 2003 and it expires March 31, 2008. This product line includes Anti-Embolism Stockings in the following sizes; Small, Medium, Large and Extra large and in short, regular, and long lengths.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes listed. <BR>	<BR>	The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>	The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U. S. Army CENTCOM.<BR><BR>	This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program, and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>	The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is July 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, phone: 011-49-6221-172109, and e-mail marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>	The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Anti-Embolism Stocking, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.   Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $31,178.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include:<BR> <BR>Stocking AE 18mm sizes: SM, MED, LG, XL	$23,175.93<BR>Stocking AE 16mm sizes: SM, MED, LG, XL	$5,591.64<BR>Stocking AE 22mm sizes: SM	$1,371.76<BR>Stocking AE 19mm sizes: MED, LG	$950.52<BR>Stocking AE 15-20mm sizes: MED	$88.38<BR> <BR>	At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>	DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) will be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>	This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>	The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR><BR>	The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>	Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date.  Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>1. In general acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows:<BR>a) Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b) The vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.	<BR>2. Each technical/company criteria below require additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability. This specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.  <BR>3.  The vendors who meet the following technical /company criteria will be qualified/invited to 	participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an e-mail communication 	with each vendor.  All communication of significant acquisition milestones (such as 	invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>1.	At a minimum your company MUST manufacture and/or distribute Anti-Embolism Stockings in the following sizes; Small, Medium, Large and Extra large and in short, regular, and long lengths.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined for this report as items used in the Europe Theater within a twelve month period. Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I). <BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Anti-Embolism Stocking product line.  Provide the DAPA number in response to this RFQ (Vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the DoD prime vendor (PV), (currently the prime vendor is Owens & Minor), for distribution in the Europe Region.  Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor in response to this RFQ.<BR>4.	Vendor MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified<BR>5.	Vendor MUST provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>6.	Vendors MUST have a vendor representative for the Europe Region Medical Treatment Facilities to provide sufficient product implementation services and customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address in response to this RFQ.<BR>7.	Vendor MUST provide all history of BACK ORDERS and RECALLS that occurred during the most recent 24-month period, for the Anti-Embolism Stocking product line including; dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.<BR>8.	Vendor MUST provide statement revealing all products containing synthesized polymer (plastic/rubber) are clearly labeled as latex free/safe in response to this RFQ.<BR>9.	The product literature will be furnished at (no charge) to the government.  Vendor MUST ship or e-mail literature necessary for evaluation via United States Parcel Service eliminating delays that occurs with Europes Custom Offices.  Provide acknowledgement of this requirement in response to this RFQ.<BR>10.	Vendor MUST provide proof that there are directions for laundering and care of the product item in response to this RFQ.<BR><BR>	Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will request literature (no charge) from the product line to be evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities.  The CPT will evaluate the product line using a literature review in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  As mentioned in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to send literature to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail address to marcee.whisenant@us.army.mil or United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the following APO address: <BR><BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice to ship literature for the clinical evaluation at Phase II.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the shipment of literature by 5:00PM EST on the 14th Calendar day after the issue date of the notice to supply literature will be disqualified from the standardization process.  NOTE: All vendors must send TRBO POC verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor, and anticipated delivery date.<BR><BR>	Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to most acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.   <BR> <BR>	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR> <BR>Vendor products meet the Clinically Acceptable Target Threshold of 3.00<BR><BR>1.	(Patient Safety) - Literature supports the toes are accessible for examination.<BR>a.	Visual accessibility to toes is required to show the product is not restricting patient circulation.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material.<BR>2.	(Patient Safety) - Literature supports that all stockings are available with no latex. <BR>a.	Product item should not cause further harm to the patient.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material. <BR><BR>	Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data.  Quotes will be based on a committed volume of 80% of the total Europe Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:<BR>1.	The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements.<BR>2.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.<BR>3.	Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of stock keeping units (SKUs) that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the government in this standardization initiative.<BR>Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.<BR>

Vendor MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5.	 Vendor must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>6.	Vendor must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the Pulse Oximetry-Finger (self-contained) products including dates, duration, cause, and resolution in response to this RFQ. Vendors will not have the opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>7.	Vendor must provide a statement confirming their products meet the industry production and safety standards (OSHA guidelines, FDA recommendations) used in manufacturing Pulse Oximetry-Finger (self-contained) products in response to this RFQ.<BR>8.	Vendor must provide documentation for all possible educational tools, materials, and ongoing clinical support that are available for Pulse Oximetry-Finger (self-contained) in response to this RFQ.<BR>9.

Vendor must provide statement revealing all products containing synthesized polymer (plastic/rubber) are clearly labeled as latex free/safe in response to this RFQ.<BR>11.	Vendor must provide documentation, in response to this RFQ, that the product line involving the self-contained pulse oximeter for the fingertip can be used by deployed military units who will be using the product under different climate (extreme temperatures +32 to +104F/0 to +40C), altitude (up to 40,000 feet/12,192 meters), light (display screen visibility day or night) conditions, along with a power source with automatic turn-off mechanism allowing extended battery life.<BR>12.	The product literature and/or samples will be furnished at (no charge) to the government.  Vendor must be able to ship samples necessary for evaluation via United States Parcel Service eliminating delays that occur with Europes Custom Offices.  Provide acknowledgement of this requirement in response to this RFQ.<BR><BR>	Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities.  The CPT will evaluate the product line using hands on evaluation of samples in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  As mentioned in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship samples to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must be shipped to the TRBO by COB, 5:00PM EST on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Vendors must forward verification (e-mail) of shipment to the TRBO.  If requested, samples will be returned to the vendor at the vendors expense.<BR><BR>	Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to most acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.   <BR> <BR>	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  The following product line items have repetitive performance criteria.  Each performance criteria will be justified only once to prevent redundancy.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>Vendor products meet the Clinically Acceptable Target Threshold of 3.00<BR><BR>1.	(User visibility, device reliability) The finger oximeter has a high quality light emitting diode (LED) under all light conditions. <BR>		a. Will determine visibility in different light conditions ranging from no-light to full daylight          <BR>                        conditions.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 5 times by each participating MTF using the product <BR>                       sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.<BR>2.	(Patient safety, device reliability) The signal is picked up and displayed within 10 seconds of being applied to the patient. <BR>		a. Gives the clinician an accurate picture of the patients oxygen saturation in a 		<BR>                        reasonable amount of time.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 5 times by each participating MTF using the product 			    sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.<BR>3.	(Reliable operation)  When the batteries are replaced the battery compartment continues to have a tight seal. <BR>		a. Batteries will be changed numerous times and the compartment needs to be water and <BR>                       dirt resistant in able to function properly.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 5 times by each participating MTF using the product 			    sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.<BR>4.	(Reliable operation)  Activation and deactivation of the automatic power shutdown feature is functional. <BR>		a. Deactivation of power does not occur when device is applied to patient.<BR>		b. Activation does not occur when device is not being used, i.e. while in combat medics 			    aid bag.<BR>		c. Each criterion will be evaluated 5 times by each participating MTF using the product 			    sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.<BR>5.	(Patient safety) The devices sensor maintains a strong signal though vibration or patient motion. <BR>		a. Reliable measurement of patients oxygen saturation during transportation of patient, 			    i.e. ground or air ambulance, carrying a patient on a litter, etc.<BR>		b. Each criterion will be evaluated 5 times by each participating MTF using the product 			    sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.<BR><BR>	Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total Europe Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:<BR>1.	The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements.<BR>2.	Impact of Unmatched Lines<BR>3.	Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of stock keeping units (SKUs) that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the government in this standardization initiative. <BR><BR>

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Request for Quotation<BR>---------------<BR>A.	 General Information<BR><BR>	Europe Region seeks approval to initiate the standardization process for Tape  Surgical for its 55 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical facilities in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Southwest Asia.  Standardization for this product line, Tape  Surgical, represents a previously standardized product line initiative for the Europe Region. The Europe Region originally completed this product line for standardization in 2003 and it expires May 31, 2008. This product line includes the following products in the following sizes.  All sizes below are in inches unless otherwise specified.<BR>i.	Surgical Silk Tape: Sizes , 1, 2, 3<BR>ii.	Surgical Cloth Tape: Sizes , 1, 2, 3, 4, 6<BR>iii.	Surgical Foam Tape: Sizes 1, 2, 3, 4<BR>iv.	Surgical Non-Woven Dressing Retention Tape: Sizes 2, 4, 6<BR>v.	Surgical Plastic/Clear Tape: Sizes , 1, 2<BR>vi.	Surgical Paper Tape: Sizes , 1, 2, 3<BR>vii.	Surgical Rayon Tape: Sizes 1, 2<BR>viii.	Surgical Cohesive Tape: Sizes 1, 3<BR><BR>Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes listed.<BR><BR>	The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>	The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity Heidelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U. S. Army CENTCOM.<BR><BR>	This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program, and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>	The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is July 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, phone: 011-49-6221-172109, and e-mail marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>	The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Tape - Surgical, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.   Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $675,601.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR>Surgical Silk Tape: Sizes  inch, 1 inch, 2 inch, 3 inch	$274,366.93<BR>Surgical Cloth Tape: Sizes  inch, 1 inch, 2 inch, 3 inch, 4 inch, 6 inch	$226,724.17<BR>Surgical Foam Tape: Sizes 1 inch, 2 inch, 3 inch, 4 inch	$78,581.51<BR>Surgical Non-Woven Dressing Retention Tape: Sizes 2 inch, 4 inch, 6 inch	$32,809.03<BR>Surgical Plastic/Clear Tape: Sizes  inch, 1 inch, 2 inch	$24,836.89<BR>Surgical Paper Tape: Sizes  inch, 1 inch, 2 inch, 3 inch	$20,584.21<BR>Surgical Rayon Tape: Sizes 1 inch, 2 inch	$10,824.52<BR>Surgical Cohesive Tape: Sizes 1 inch, 3 inch	$6,874.11<BR> <BR>	At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>	This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>	The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR><BR>	The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>	Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date.  Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>1. In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: <BR>a.	Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such products or services.<BR>b.	The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>c.	Each technical/company criteria below require additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  This specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.<BR><BR>2.  The vendors who meet the following technical /company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an e-mail communication with each vendor.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>1.	At a minimum, your company MUST manufacture and/or distribute the following Tape - Surgical.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined for this report as items used in the Europe Theater within a twelve month period.  All sizes below are in inches unless otherwise specified. <BR>a.   Usage Items:<BR>1) Surgical Silk Tape: Sizes 1/2, 1, 2, 3<BR>2) Surgical Cloth Tape: Sizes 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6<BR>3) Surgical Foam Tape: Sizes 1, 2, 3, 4<BR>4) Surgical Non-Woven Dressing Retention Tape: Sizes 2, 4, 6<BR>5) Surgical Plastic/Clear Tape: Sizes 1/2, 1, 2<BR>6) Surgical Paper Tape: Sizes 1/2, 1, 2, 3<BR>7) Surgical Rayon Tape: Sizes 1, 2<BR>8) Surgical Cohesive Tape: Sizes 1, 3<BR>      b. Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>2.

Provide the DAPA number in response to this RFQ (Vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (PV) (currently the prime vendor is Owens & Minor) for distribution in the Europe Region. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.) Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor in response to this RFQ. <BR>4.	Vendor MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified. <BR>5.	Vendor MUST provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>6.	Vendor MUST have a vendor representative for the Europe Region Medical Treatment Facilities to provide sufficient product implementation services and customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.

Provide acknowledgement of this requirement in response to this RFQ. <BR>10.	Product literature will be furnished at (no charge) to the government.  Vendor MUST provide literature that supports units of issue are available in sizes that require the minimum amount of MTF storage capabilities in response to this RFQ.<BR><BR>	Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will request literature (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities.  The CPT will evaluate the product line using a literature review in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  As mentioned in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship literature to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice to ship literature for the clinical evaluation at Phase II.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the shipment of literature by 5:00PM EST on the 14th Calendar day after the issue date of the notice to supply literature will be disqualified from the standardization process.  NOTE: All vendors must send TRBO POC verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor, and anticipated delivery date.<BR><BR>	Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to most acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.   <BR> <BR>	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR> <BR>Vendor products meet the Clinically Acceptable Target Threshold of 3.00<BR><BR>1.	(Clinical Preference) Literature supports that scissors are not required for cutting or tearing tape.<BR>a.	Decreases time in seeking an instrument for preparation.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material.<BR>2.	(Patient Safety) Literature supports the tape adhesive is non-irritating/hypoallergenic to the patient.<BR>a.	Product item should not cause further harm to the patient.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material.<BR>3.	(Urgent Patient Care Setting) Literature supports the packaging identifies the size and type of tape.<BR>a.	Reduces the amount of time needed for staff to select the appropriate size for patient care needs.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material. <BR>4.	(Product efficiency) Literature supports the tapes ability to adhere to skin.<BR>a.	The function of tape is to hold a dressing in place through routine daily activities that may cause patient motion and perspiration.<BR>b.	 This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material.<BR><BR>	Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total Europe Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:<BR>1.	The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements.<BR>2.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.<BR>3.	Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of stock keeping units (SKUs) that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the government in this standardization initiative.<BR>

As mentioned in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship literature to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice to ship literature for the clinical evaluation at Phase II.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the shipment of literature by 5:00PM EST on the 14th Calendar day after the issue date of the notice to supply literature will be disqualified from the standardization process.  NOTE: All vendors must send TRBO POC verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and the anticipated delivery date.<BR><BR>	Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to more acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.   <BR> <BR>	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR> <BR>Vendor products meet the Clinically Acceptable Target Threshold of 3.00<BR><BR>1.	(Patient Safety)  Literature supports surgical sponge package allows for aseptic delivery to sterile field. <BR>a.	This function is needed to maintain a sterile field and to reduce the chance of infection.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material.<BR>2.	(Patient Safety)  Literature supports that surgical sponges do not lint. Lint is defined as any particle that falls off the surgical sponge during use. <BR>a.	Eliminates foreign body remnants which can increase the occurrence of inflammation and possible infection after removing sponges during surgical procedure.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material.<BR>3.	(Product function)  Literature supports the sponges are United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) type VII gauze content.<BR>a.	USP type VII gauze is a standard set for surgical sponge absorbency required by surgeons.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material.<BR>4.	(Patient safety)  Literature supports the surgical sponges are made of non-toxic and color fast dyes.<BR>a.	Product item should not cause further harm to the patient.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material.<BR><BR>	Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total Europe Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:<BR>1.	The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements.<BR>2.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.<BR>3.	Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the government in this standardization initiative.  <BR>

Provide acknowledgement of this requirement in response to this RFQ.<BR>10.	Product literature will be furnished at (no charge) to the government.  Vendor MUST provide various sizes and various units of issue for storage capabilities in small as well as large Medical Treatment Facilities in response to this RFQ.<BR><BR>	Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will request literature (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities.  The CPT will evaluate the product line using a literature review in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  As mentioned in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship literature to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice to ship literature for the clinical evaluation at Phase II.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the shipment of literature by 5:00PM EST on the 14th Calendar day after the issue date of the notice to supply literature will be disqualified from the standardization process.  NOTE: All vendors must send TRBO POC verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor, and anticipated delivery date.<BR><BR>	Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to more acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.   <BR> <BR>	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR> <BR>Vendor products meet the Clinically Acceptable Target Threshold of 3.00<BR><BR>1.	(Patient Safety) Literature supports the color/dyed portion of the products is color fast. <BR>a.	Product item should not cause further harm to the patient.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material.<BR>2.	(Infection Control) Literature supports the products are leak proof.<BR>a.	Prevents body fluid contamination of surrounding environment and causing possible harm to patient, other patients, and hospital staff.  <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material.<BR>3.	(Infection Control) Literature supports products are of single use and disposable.<BR>a.	Prevents cross contamination between patients that may cause further harm.  <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material.<BR>4.	(Patient Safety) Literature supports the basins, urinals, bowls, pitchers, and pans have an accessible area for the patient identification label.<BR>a.	Prevents cross contamination between patients that may cause further harm.  <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 1 time by each participating MTF using literature review material.<BR><BR>	Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total Europe Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:<BR>1.	The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements.<BR>2.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.<BR>3.	Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the government in this standardization initiative<BR>

<DESC>The Marine Corps System Command, (MARCORSYSCOM), is issuing this Sources Sought Notice to identify potential vendors and to acquire enhanced knowledge and understanding of industrys capabilities regarding Bandwidth Mitigation and Data Compression for possible use in support of Marine Corps Autonomic Logistics efforts.  The mission of the Autonomic Logistics (AL) program is to report logistic information in near real-time from each platform/asset within its local area up through the area of operations (AO), to the theater and strategic levels beyond.  AL is currently deploying an embedded platform logistics system (EPLS) that will monitor and process individual platform logistic status.  This status consists of data elements including platform health, ammunition and fuel levels, and mobile load information.  This data will then need to be compiled and rolled-up to the command platform to be monitored and transmitted to the theater and strategic levels.  A secure data transmission method will allow the collection and reporting of logistic information between platforms assigned to a specific mission and to external information users involved in the support and sustainment of the mission.  Bandwidth for any logistics data will be limited so bandwidth mitigation / data compression tools will be required to support the expected logistics data transfer requirements.  This product will increase the visibility of the tactical level logistic requirements (such as identifying the support request for repair parts/consumables and tracking of mobile load distribution events.  MARCORSYSCOM is interested in obtaining information on bandwidth mitigation/data compression systems, hardware, and software that is currently available, which meet the most desirable features outlined as follows: (1) Communications (potential data transmission paths) - Will take multiple paths and be bi-directional from a command vehicle to the garrison (Forward Deployed Master to Regional), from the command vehicle to the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) (Forward Deployed Master to Enterprise), from a Garrison through a network to a command deployed vehicle (Regional to Forward Deployed Master), from MCEN to the Command vehicle (Enterprise to Forward Deployed Master), from a local vehicle to the command vehicle (Local to Forward Deployed Master), from a local deployed vehicle to the MCEN (Local to Enterprise), and from a local vehicle to local vehicle (Local to Local; (2) Compression - Compression can be construed as the minimizing of data size to allow for more efficient transmission; (3) Bandwidth Mitigation - The goal is to improve the efficiency of transmission, processing, or speed of data between functional units; (4) Reconfigurable - the Data Compression / Bandwidth Mitigation products must be reconfigurable through an easy to use interface.  Some things that should be configurable include: Type or ratio of compression, containers / folders that are being watched/compressed, and post-compression file checking; (5) Robustness - System needs to be able to perform in the anticipated con-ops to include: dynamically changing topologies resulting from mobile nodes, scalability with respect to the number of nodes and increasing traffic, dropped connections and resumed links, and meeting Navy/Marine Corps firewall security protocols and requirements.  All vendors, having products they believe adequately address the Marine Corps data compression and bandwidth mitigation characteristics, are requested to submit three copies of related brochures, descriptions, or other documentation.  Most importantly, vendors are required to submit any and all test data and test reports showing independent (preferably Government) evaluation of their systems that meet the requirements of the characteristics.  Responses should include statements and independent test data that demonstrate how their products satisfy the Marine Corps most desirable features.  Responses shall be submitted no later than 30 May 2008 to COMMANDER, MARCORSYSCOM, Contracts  PG-16 (CT 023), Attn: Dwight B. Micheal, Sr., 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, Virginia, 22134-6050.  No telephonic responses will be considered. Submitted information will not be returned.  This is not a request for proposal or quotation.  No solicitation document exists.  This is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure these items, nor does the Marine Corps intend to award on the basis of the sources sought/market research or otherwise pay for the information requested.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI.

<DESC>The Marine Corps System Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice to identify potential vendors and to acquire enhanced knowledge and understanding of industrys capabilities regarding a Cross Domain solution for possible use in support of Marine Corps Autonomic Logistics efforts.  The mission of the Autonomic Logistics (AL) program is to report logistic information in near real-time from each platform/asset within its local area up through the area of operations (AO), to the theater and strategic levels beyond.  AL is currently deploying an embedded platform logistics system (EPLS) that will monitor and process individual platform logistic status.  This status consists of data elements including platform health, ammunition levels, fuel levels, and mobile load information.  This data will then need to be compiled and rolled-up to the command platform to be monitored and transmitted to the theater and strategic levels.  Some of this data will be transmitted over the secure tactical network.  The AL Program is looking for a cost effective Cross Domain solution.  A Cross Domain Solution is a trusted secure operating environment that can transmit cleared or transliterated data across security domains (such as unclassified to classified and classified to unclassified).  The AL program has a requirement to process data that may or may not be classified.  If data is of a classified nature, the Cross Domain solution must have the capability to properly sanitize a defined data format and pass this sanitized data to a lower classification.  This product will increase the visibility of the tactical level logistic requirements (such as identifying the support request for repair parts/consumables and tracking of mobile load distribution events).  MARCORSYSCOM is interested in obtaining information on systems currently available.  Some of the key features that the AL Program expects from a Cross Domain solution are as follows:  (1) Should be National Security Agency (NSA) certified or capable of certification by NSA; (2) Should be cost effective and hardware should be compact and mountable in a tactical vehicle; (3) A rule methodology should be used to provide a guard solution to verify that data contains no data of a sensitive nature when passing high to low.  A methodology should exist to parse and pass data from the low side to the high side; (4) A transliteration methodology should also be employed to facilitate the replacement or deletion of data that is considered sensitive in nature when transmitting data from a classified environment to an unclassified file; (5) Virus scanning must be enacted to prevent the spread of malicious code across security domains; (6) Data formats should be clearly defined in a schema (For example, an XSD schema defines an XML file layout).  That is, a rigid format of data, the expected field lengths, alpha/numeric requirements, and any free-text fields should be defined; (7) Throughput and reliability metrics should be available to measure the effectiveness of the system; (8) Transmission of some AL data will be from the high side.  AL needs to get some of this data to the low side.  The data that AL generates will trigger help and support activities on the high and low side; (9) Once AL data is in the enterprise, AL data will be transmitted to applications on the high side and the low side; (10) AL data generated on the low side will need to be transmitted to the high side for greater situational awareness and common operating picture, and (11) AL data generated on the high side will need to be transmitted to the low side where the logistics systems operate (such as the Marine Corps Supply System, financial, logistical, or others).  All vendors, having products they believe adequately address the Marine Corps Cross Domain solution requirements, are requested to submit three copies of related brochures, descriptions, or other documentation. Most importantly, vendors are required to submit any and all test data and test reports showing independent (preferably Government) evaluation of their systems that meet the requirements of the characteristics cited above.  Responses should include statements and independent test data that demonstrate how their products satisfy the Marine Corps most desirable features.

The criteria development group must be comprised of representatives from the major fire service organizations nationwide.  The IAFC is the only major national fire service organization that has a proprietary network that can identify and obtain representatives from the major fire service organizations to serve as the subject matter experts in order to meet the mandatory timeframe and available budget for this purchase order.  The IAFC possesses the knowledge base skills and expertise required to fully comprehend the AFG Program needs and thus to obtain the desired results required by the Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974, as amended.  The IAFC is considered a uniquely neutral organization in terms of the national fire service in that it represents both career and volunteer departments and includes minority representation. They also represent officers from various specialty areas such as operations, training and fire prevention.  Additionally, the IAFC has qualified staff uniquely familiar with the fire service and work requirements involved in the fire grants program and the criteria development group.  They have a broad range of experience in fire, EMS, training/education, and/or fire prevention as well as extensive experience and a working knowledge with the AFG program.  The objectives of this requirement are to:  (1) validate and/or modify the programs established priorities and criteria using experience and lessons learned from previous year; (2) review and recommend any alterations or additional rating criteria to DHS for each of the programs and all associated activities eligible under the AFG authorization; (3) match all existing and potential criteria against the goals and objectives of USFA strategic planning and revise to improve achievement of these goals, if warranted; (4)) develop separate criteria within each program area (and associated activities) that identifies priorities, numeric value and formula for rural, suburban, and urban fire department; (5) provide detail in the reports on the areas where agreement was not reached among all participating organizations relating to priority, numeric value, and formulas associated with the criteria and identify the organizations that disagreed and the details of the various objections; (6) identify and recommend appropriate eligible expenditures for each category and within each category for each department type, as necessary; (7) identify measurable, results-oriented outcomes for each activity that could be reported by grantees as part of the close-out process; (8) assess the effectiveness of the process via a follow-up conference call to discuss lessons learned in addition to program parameters that are likely to be influenced by on-going efforts in Congress as the programs reauthorization is decided; and (9) provide recommendations for AFG strategic goals and performance measures in conjunction with consideration of stated DHS and FEMA goals and recommendations proposed in the 2007 NAPA AFG assessment report.   All deliverables are due by March 31, 2009.  Anticipated value of this acquisition is less than $100,000.  If your firm is capable of performing the work, you are requested to submit a capability statement.  All capabilities statements submitted by interested parties will be considered.  The minimum capabilities must include documented evidence of experience and expertise in the following areas:   (1) An integral knowledge of FEMAs Assistance to Firefighters Grant program including historical knowledge of its criteria development and funding priority processes;  (2) Requisite knowledge of the AFG electronic application scoring matrices as it applies to program criteria  development; (3) Experience working with government personnel regarding government invitational travel procedures and restrictions; (4) Project management and subject matter expertise in grants management, federal accounting, technical and analytical areas; (5) Experience in putting together working groups consisting of  fire service professionals representing the major fire service organizations and subsequent facilitation of said groups with the goal of arriving at consensus on annual prioritization of national fire service priorities for the purposes of a Federal grant program; and (6) Experience in the development and production of a variety of documents for clients and their stakeholders including grants policy, human capital planning, statistical analysis and business processes.  Interested firms with these capabilities are invited to submit a copy of their capability statement electronically via email to cindy.adams@dhs.gov by May 8, 2008.  Information furnished should include:   (1) The number and professional qualifications of technical and other appropriate personnel; (2) Company experience related to the proposed project; (3) A current financial statement; and (4) Other literature which demonstrates the minimum capabilities listed above.  It is the responsibility of the vendor to ensure the email was received.  The Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted. Based upon responses received, the Government reserves the right to set aside any and all procurements that may result hereunder for small or minority-owned businesses.  If the evaluation of the responses received concludes that none of the responding firms have the necessary capabilities, then this acquisition will become a Sole Source Procurement with the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and no further synopsis will be issued.  SEE NUMBERED NOTE 22.

The workshop will consist of technical sessions in the areas of (1) leveraging the capabilities inherent to the perceptual-motor system while minimizing limitations (2) understanding and leveraging the neural processes underlying complex decisions and (3) predicting and validating individual differences in neuro-cognitive processing in scenarios reflecting operational stressors.  Workshop participants are welcome to give a short briefing describing their ongoing research efforts in order to help define the state-of-the-art in cognition and neuroergonomics and/or identify fundamental technical barriers that might be addressed by this initiative, the capabilities enabled if these issues were resolved, and potential approaches to addressing these issues.  <BR><BR>Network Science Research and Technology Center of Excellence<BR><BR><BR>The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is developing preliminary plans for a potential Network Science Research and Technology Center of Excellence consisting of four components: a Social Cognitive Networks Research Center, an Information Networks Research Center, a Communication Networks Research Center and an Integration Center for evaluation and analysis of research outputs and overall management of the Center of Excellence.<BR><BR>Workshop participants are welcome to give a short briefing describing their ongoing research efforts in order to help define the state-of-the-art in the technical areas related to Network Science and Information Fusion or identify fundamental technical barriers that might be addressed by this initiative. The submissions for the presentations should address technical barriers in the areas pertaining to Network Science as described here, the capabilities enabled if these issues were resolved, and potential approaches to addressing these issues.  The workshop will consist of technical sessions pertaining to the following areas:<BR><BR>The Social Cognitive Networks Research Center will execute a basic and applied research program to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in how networks influence and are influenced by human behavior in the context of military decision making.  The workshop will cover how people interface with the network and the information products generated by the Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (TCPED) process, how they process situational information, especially its representation to humans and how they make military decisions under the stresses of combat.  This Center will also execute research in understanding of social networks as input to an overall networking architecture.<BR><BR>The Information Networks Research Center will execute a basic and applied research program to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in knowledge management, self-organizing services, secure information flows and information networks with the aim of providing revolutionary enhancements to the way DoD exploits battle command, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data for land warfare.   In order to reduce information and communications network overload, information must be stored in knowledge bases that are easily accessible through autonomic self-organizing services across varying security domains to facilitate fusion of disparate data sources and information sources.  The information networks research will exploit the full range of potential data sources including imaging and non-imaging sensors, communications, human reports, geospatial data, etc.  As part of the workshop, there will be discussions to identify critical technology enablers such as modeling and performance metrics of integrated information network systems, and closed-loop networked architectures to address TCPED capabilities.  <BR><BR>The Communication Networks Research Center will execute a basic and applied research program to enhance the military communication infrastructure to enable a dynamic, wireless, mobile environment that supports a heterogeneous mixture of individual soldiers, ground vehicles, airborne platforms, unmanned aerial vehicles, robotics, and unattended ground sensor networks.  The research will investigate complex wireless infrastructure operating over noisy wireless channels with high levels of interference and jamming, while on-the-move with highly mobile nodes and mobile network infrastructure.  The environment for the network includes rapidly changing network topologies requiring autonomic adaptation and self-configuration. There will be discussions on techniques to model (at sufficient fidelity and with sufficient scale), design, analyze, predict, and control the behavior of secure tactical communication networks, sensing, and command-and-control networks.  <BR><BR>The Integration Center will be jointly operated by personnel from the Center of Excellence and Government employees.  The primary functions of the Integration Center will be to evaluate and leverage research from the other three Centers as well as other research entities. The Integration Center will be a component of the Computational and Information Sciences Directorate in the U.S. Army Research Laboratory.  Performance evaluations by the Integration Center will be end-to-end to assess the performance of the information networks, social cognitive networks, and communications networks as systems of systems.  In addition, the Integration Center will collaborate with the other three centers to engage with potential DoD and civilian agency customers to transition mature research products.<BR><BR>Primary Point of Contact:<BR>Ms. Pearl Gendason<BR>Pearl.Gendason@us.army.mil<BR>Phone: 301-394-2573<BR><BR>Secondary Point of Contact:<BR>Ms. Renee Besanson<BR>ACTA2008@sainc.com<BR>Phone: 703-797-4584

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard intends to procure help with interagency and international initiatives such as senior level briefs and bilateral consultations.  This proposed procurement is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis to SAR CONSULTING INCORPORATED (Mr. Dan Lemon). 2621 REDBUD LN, OWINGS, MD 20736.

SCOPE:   
1.)	Mr. Lemon is needed to support the SAR Program on national and international work that impacts Coast Guard and federal interagency operations. This work is complex, unique, and involves many federal stakeholders who have civil search and rescue (SAR/lifesaving) responsibilities, including obligations to carry out catastrophic incident SAR (CIS). He would assist by providing subject matter expertise, developing recommended solutions to problems, reviewing proposals, and liaison with staff and high level officials. Supporting the Coast Guard sponsored National SAR committee (NSARC) by writing the federal CIS addendum to the National SAR manual, supporting work on international agreements, and helping to prepare U.S papers for international forums on SAR matters are examples of the services he would provide.
2.)	The current government need is to build on efforts the Mr. Lemon initiated and oversaw while he was a Coast Guard employee.  Much of this work has not been done due to current staff shortfalls that have resulted in inadequate progress of the Coast Guard and its partner federal agencies in being prepared to deal with catastrophic incidents such as Hurricane Katrina, raising concerns about the ability to respond in a way that would be most effective in saving lives.  In the international arena, because the work is complex, unique, and spread over years, there are no commercial sources of help who know the history and potential pitfalls of current initiatives, and how to best get results working through various international organizations.  Much of this work was handled almost single-handedly by Mr. Lemon in prior years.
3.)	Because the Coast Guard SAR program at USCG Headquarters has been the sole entity involved in these types of services, it is clear that the experience necessary could only be obtained by working in this office.  No one else is currently available with this background and capabilities.


Note 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The following provision is included in full text:

FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal (Aug 1999)

The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this RFQ to a responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable process.  Quotes shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  Factor 1  Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Governments requirement and Factor 2  Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a go/no go basis.  If a quote has been determined to be a go on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offerors past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quote and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quote evaluated for the lowest price.

Factor 1  Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Governments requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of descriptive literature that clearly indicates what the offeror is proposing and will be providing all products in accordance with the stated characteristics in the Scope of Work (SOW).  Descriptive literature means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quote.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered meet the specifications in the SOW.  The information is required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  
                                              
Factor 2  Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offerors record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offerors adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offerors reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offerors business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quote will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

Offerors must submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS with the price offer, or may complete the representations and certifications on the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.

Prices, representations/certifications, descriptive literature, and past performance information must be received NLT 4:00 PM EDST on Friday, MAY 9, 2008.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

                                                    Commandant (G-APO-1))

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;     (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-     (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and     (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.     ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.     (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:     (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.     (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.     (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:     (i) warrants;     (ii) options;     (iii) contracts to acquire stock;     (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.     (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.     (f) Disclosure.     By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:     "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.     "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;     (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-     (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and     (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.     ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.     (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:     (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.     (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.     (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:     (i) warrants;     (ii) options;     (iii) contracts to acquire stock;     (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.     (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.     (f) Disclosure.     By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.     (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions that have been submitted and to extend the response date to 9:00AM EST, on 24 April 2008.</p>
<p>1. Will the government accept representations and certifications in hardcopy in place of the online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)? If so, which representations and certifications does the Government require?</p>
<p>Yes, the government will accept a hard copy of the representations and certifications, however the contractor will be required to provide the online representations and certification (ORCA) within 1 week of contract award.</p>
<p><br />2. Security clearance requirement. Will the Government hold the clearances of contractor personnel working on this contract?</p>
<p>No, contractor/contractor personnel are required to hold a secret clearance in accordance with the solicitation.</p>
<p>3. Service Contract Act (SCA). Can the Government provide a copy of the wage determination applicable to this contract?</p>
<p>Yes, WD 05-2543 (Rev.-5) is applicable (see attached).</p>
<p>4. Does the Government have a particular aircraft or platform in mind to accomplish this SOW?</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>5. If not, would a C-12 be an acceptable aircraft?</p>
<p>All aircraft will be evaluated to determine whether or not they can meet the requirements as set forth in the SOW.</p>
<p>6. Would the aircraft need to simultaneously carry 6 passengers plus<br />all the sensor equipment/payload identified in the solicitation?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>7. What is the approximate total weight of the sensor payload and<br />related equipment?</p>
<p>About 300lbs total.</p>
<p><br />8. Would operations likely occur at altitudes higher than 28,000 feet MSL?</p>
<p>No. Altitudes for this mission will not require altitudes of greater than 28K.</p>
<p>9. Is the contractor expected to provide the FLIR, EO sensor, LLTV<br />sensor, IR pointer, and FMV?</p>
<p><br />Yes (Also, FMV must be Rover III compatible)</p>
<p>10. What mission equipment (including comms) will be provided by the<br />Government?</p>
<p>The Government will only provide UHF/SATCOM radio but will not provide<br />UHF/SATCOM antennas.</p>
<p><br />11. Will Government consider adding Limitations of Liability Clause<br />52.246.23 or 24?</p>
<p>No, the Limitations of Liability Clauses 52.246-23 and 52.246-24 will not be incorporated into the contract and/or solicitation.</p>
<p><br />12. Paragraph 2 of the synopsis states that "the contractor shall provide a high performance aircraft capable of operating at altitudes as high as 30,000 feet above ground level."</p>
<p>Question: Is this altitude a hard requirement or will 25,000 feet be sufficient?</p>
<p>See answer 8 above, a minimum of 28,000 feet will be required.</p>
<p><br />13. Paragraph 2 of the synopsis states that "the aircraft shall be capable of transporting 6 passengers."</p>
<p>Question: Our aircraft is considered single piloted and can thus be flown with one or two pilots. If flown with just one pilot, we could theoretically put a passenger in the co-pilot seat, and four sensor operators or other passengers in the back for a total of six personnel in the aircraft. Is this acceptable to the government?</p>
<p>The government requires an aircraft that can hold six military passengers not including the pilot or crew.</p>
<p><br />14. Paragraph 2 of the synopsis states that the aircraft "shall be fitted with and have full functional control of a 4th generation or better Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) payload to include Electro-optical (EO) sensor, Low Light TV (LLTV) sensor, and IR (Laser) Pointer."</p>
<p>Question: Our aircraft is equipped with a 3rd generation system. Does the government have a particular 4th generation system in mind?</p>
<p>The original solicitation should have read..."3rd generation pod" or better, the system will be a part of the evaluation process.</p>
<p><br />15. Paragraph 4 of the synopsis states that "aircraft crew and passengers shall hold a current security clearance of SECRET or higher and shall receive prior approval from NSWDG SSO prior to participating."</p>
<p>Question: Does the government desire the contractor to provide a set number of crew members or sensor operators or sensor operator training to satisfy the requirements of the mission?</p>
<p>No.</p>

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of an HP digital sender.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST has identified the Canon S5 camera as the only camera on the market that works with our current Software Development Kit.  If we were to change the software development kit, we would have to re-engineer several of our systems.  We would have to change our Immigrant Visa and non-Immigrant visa software in order to be compatible with the new SDK.  Furthermore, we would have to replace all of the 2000 cameras we previously deployed because they would no longer be compatible with the new SDK because it is virtually impossible and highly impracticable to run two SDKs on the same system.  The costs of developing a new SDK, retrofitting our two visa software systems for compatibility and replacing all cameras currently in the field would be prohibitive, wasteful and not in order with our duty as stewards of the taxpayers money.  
The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>FOR THIS SOLICITATION ONLY: Open Market items totaling not more than $3,000 may be offered, as part of a valid GSA bid, only in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the cited GSA schedule, and subject to documentation, review, and approval of the soliciting contracting officer prior to award. Pursuant to FAR 8.402(f)(3) any open market item must be documented as "Open Market" item in the bid detail.<BR><BR>

<a href="mailto:Scott.Elaine@.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Enivornmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 4 has requested that the Environmental Response Team (ERT) support the Anniston PCBs site by providing technical assistance for the ecological risk assessment and related processess within the Remedial Investigationand Feasibility Study (RI/FS).  Support will be provided through the review of deliverables submitted by Solutia, Inc., the attendance of ERT at meetings when appropriate, and through field oversight.  Due to the magnitude of this project, ERT will require contract support to provide the level of assistance needed by Region 4 on this site for the next three years.  The contract will run through May 2, 2011. BACKGROUND:  PCBs were produced at the former Monsanto plant (facility) in Anniston, Alabama from 1929-1971.  Production was initially started by Southern Manganese Corp., which was later renamed Swann Chemical Company and subsequently purchased by Monsanto Company.  Solutia, Inc., the present Facility owner, was created in 1997 as a spin-off of Monsanto.  The migration of PCBs away from the Facility occurred as a result of surface water transport.  During precipitation events, surface water flowed through areas containing PCBs and into various drainage ditches leading to Snow Creek.  Subsequently, PCBs absorbed to suspended solids settled out in some areas of the floodways of these drainage ditches and Snow Creek.  Solutia has made significant improvements to the Facility by covering areas with PCB-contaiing soil and controlling surface water run-on and off from the Facility.  These controls were implemented to prevent PCBs from migrating away from the Facility and adjoining areas.  PCBs have also been found as a result of direct disposal of PCB-containing materials or the relocation of PCB-containing sediment, foundry sand and/or flood plain soils.  EPA began sampling residential properties at the Anniston PCB site in 1999.  EPA collected samples from approximately 570 residences.  Samples from churches, common areas, vacant lands, parks, commercial/industrial sites, schools and other public lands were also collected.  Solutia began sampling residential properties as specified in an agreement with EPA (the Time-Critical Removal Order) in May of 2001.  The removal action level was set at 10 parts per million (ppm).  Since that date, Solutia has completed sampling activities at all the residential properties where access has been granted.  Solutia has requested access for conducting removal actions from 28 properties under provisions of the Time-Critical Removal Order.  Access was granted for 15 of the properties and denied for 13 of the properties.  At the time this fact sheet was prepared, Solutia had completed cleanup at all the properties where access was granted and cleanup was required.  Activities performed at these properties included sampling for PCBs, soil removal and disposal, placement of clean fill material and re-vegetation.  A Partial Consent Decree (PCD) for the site was entered by the US District Court for the Northern District of Alabama on August 4, 2003.  The PCD requires Solutia to continue under the Time Critical Removal Order and begin a Non-Time Critical Removal (NTC) and a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS).  The NTC Removal Action is being used at the Anniston PCB Site to achieve immediate risk reduction on residential properties not addressed by the Time-Critial Removal Order while the RI/FS is completed and the final remedy is selected.  There are multiple short term deadlines (Court imposed and/or negotiated with Solutia) that require expedited review and revision.  The contractor shall perform the following duties: (1) Review baseline ecological risk assessment documents for Operable Units 1+2 and Operable Unit 4.  This will be a critical review of four (4) separate documents; (2) The critical reviews of documents shall include review of the text and a technical review of the sampling plans and results.  This critical technical review will include, at minimum: a)Confirmation that sample designs are statistically and scientifically valid and will provide the data necessary to make decisions; b)Confirmation that proper, decision-oriented analytical techniques are used; c) Evaluation of data from sampling efforts and bioassays; d) Confirmation that appropriate risk models and proper in-put parameters and exposure factors are used in the risk assessments; and e) Confirmation of risk calculations. (3) Travel for appropriate site meetings and/or field oversights purposes.  The contractor will need to accompany the ERT representatives on two occasions; (4) Prepare summary reports containing comments from the critical reviews; (5) Assist in the derivation of Data Quality Objectives on future components of the RI; (6) Provide support to ERT on issues related to coordination and communication with State and Federal Trustees; (7) Provide technical review and comment letters to ERT on documents related to ecological risk;  and (8) Assistance in developing risk based ecologically relevant cleanup goals for all operable units related to the Anniston Site.  The NAICS Code is 541620. Offeror shall provide a fixed price quotation via email for the aforementioned SOW by 2PM, EST on April 30, 2008.  Quotations must include a plan describing the offeror's technical capability and proposed methodology for performing the tasks in the SOW.  The offeror shall also provide three past performance references which may be contacted by the Contracting Officer.  The Government may also obtain past performance information from other sources.  The technical proposal plan should not exceed 5 pages total (including attachments).  To receive full consideration for award, respondents must completly address all of the following evaluation factors. (1) Technical Capability: Demonstrated ability to perform the tasks and/or services in the SOW.  The soundness of the contractor's proposed methodology to accomplish the tasks in the SOW; (2) Past Performance: Relevant past performance with particular emphasis on timeliness, responsiveness, professionalism and cost control; (3) Price.  The evaluation factors are listed in order of importance.

Support will be provided through the review of deliverables submitted by Solutia, Inc., the attendance of ERT at meetings when appropriate, and through field oversight.  Due to the magnitude of this project, ERT will require contract support to provide the level of assistance needed by Region 4 on this site for the next three years.  The contract will run through May 2, 2011. BACKGROUND:  PCBs were produced at the former Monsanto plant (facility) in Anniston, Alabama from 1929-1971.  Production was initially started by Southern Manganese Corp., which was later renamed Swann Chemical Company and subsequently purchased by Monsanto Company.  Solutia, Inc., the present Facility owner, was created in 1997 as a spin-off of Monsanto.  The migration of PCBs away from the Facility occurred as a result of surface water transport.  During precipitation events, surface water flowed through areas containing PCBs and into various drainage ditches leading to Snow Creek.  Subsequently, PCBs absorbed to suspended solids settled out in some areas of the floodways of these drainage ditches and Snow Creek.  Solutia has made significant improvements to the Facility by covering areas with PCB-contaiing soil and controlling surface water run-on and off from the Facility.  These controls were implemented to prevent PCBs from migrating away from the Facility and adjoining areas.  PCBs have also been found as a result of direct disposal of PCB-containing materials or the relocation of PCB-containing sediment, foundry sand and/or flood plain soils.  EPA began sampling residential properties at the Anniston PCB site in 1999.  EPA collected samples from approximately 570 residences.  Samples from churches, common areas, vacant lands, parks, commercial/industrial sites, schools and other public lands were also collected.  Solutia began sampling residential properties as specified in an agreement with EPA (the Time-Critical Removal Order) in May of 2001.  The removal action level was set at 10 parts per million (ppm).  Since that date, Solutia has completed sampling activities at all the residential properties where access has been granted.  Solutia has requested access for conducting removal actions from 28 properties under provisions of the Time-Critical Removal Order.  Access was granted for 15 of the properties and denied for 13 of the properties.  At the time this fact sheet was prepared, Solutia had completed cleanup at all the properties where access was granted and cleanup was required.  Activities performed at these properties included sampling for PCBs, soil removal and disposal, placement of clean fill material and re-vegetation.  A Partial Consent Decree (PCD) for the site was entered by the US District Court for the Northern District of Alabama on August 4, 2003.  The PCD requires Solutia to continue under the Time Critical Removal Order and begin a Non-Time Critical Removal (NTC) and a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS).  The NTC Removal Action is being used at the Anniston PCB Site to achieve immediate risk reduction on residential properties not addressed by the Time-Critial Removal Order while the RI/FS is completed and the final remedy is selected.  There are multiple short term deadlines (Court imposed and/or negotiated with Solutia) that require expedited review and revision.  The contractor shall perform the following duties: (1) Review baseline ecological risk assessment documents for Operable Units 1+2 and Operable Unit 4.  This will be a critical review of four (4) separate documents; (2) The critical reviews of documents shall include review of the text and a technical review of the sampling plans and results.  This critical technical review will include, at minimum: a)Confirmation that sample designs are statistically and scientifically valid and will provide the data necessary to make decisions; b)Confirmation that proper, decision-oriented analytical techniques are used; c) Evaluation of data from sampling efforts and bioassays; d) Confirmation that appropriate risk models and proper in-put parameters and exposure factors are used in the risk assessments; and e) Confirmation of risk calculations. (3) Travel for appropriate site meetings and/or field oversights purposes.  The contractor will need to accompany the ERT representatives on two occasions; (4) Prepare summary reports containing comments from the critical reviews; (5) Assist in the derivation of Data Quality Objectives on future components of the RI; (6) Provide support to ERT on issues related to coordination and communication with State and Federal Trustees; (7) Provide technical review and comment letters to ERT on documents related to ecological risk;  and (8) Assistance in developing risk based ecologically relevant cleanup goals for all operable units related to the Anniston Site.  The NAICS Code is 541620. Offeror shall provide a fixed price quotation via email for the aforementioned SOW by 2PM, EST on April 30, 2008.  Quotations must include a plan describing the offeror's technical capability and proposed methodology for performing the tasks in the SOW.  The offeror shall also provide three past performance references which may be contacted by the Contracting Officer.  The Government may also obtain past performance information from other sources.  The technical proposal plan should not exceed 5 pages total (including attachments).  To receive full consideration for award, respondents must completly address all of the following evaluation factors. (1) Technical Capability: Demonstrated ability to perform the tasks and/or services in the SOW.  The soundness of the contractor's proposed methodology to accomplish the tasks in the SOW; (2) Past Performance: Relevant past performance with particular emphasis on timeliness, responsiveness, professionalism and cost control; (3) Price.  The evaluation factors are listed in order of importance.  Finally, please provide general business information such as Tax Identification NUmber (TIN), business classification or socioeconomic status.  Please submit quotes/proposal to: scott.elaine@epa.gov.   Please direct all questions and/or comments to this email address as well.

<RESPDATE>052208
<CONTACT>Linda I Luczak, Phone 202-260-0271, Email linda.luczak@hhs.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A FORMAL SYNOPSIS OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.2.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is seeking to acquire medical countermeasures (MCM) that will support an effective public health emergency response to a radiological or nuclear event.  The United States Government (USG) intends to award one or more contracts to the responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) is responsive to the solicitation.  The award will be a five year Firm Fixed Price contract for MCMs that can specifically treat the neutropenia component of Acute Radiation Syndrome.  Neutropenia is defined as the depression of neutrophils which occurs as a component of the hematologic pathologies arising following sufficient exposure to ionizing radiation (h-ARS).   It is the goal of the RFP to obtain advanced development products, i.e., at a development level, as classified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which are in no less than Phase 2 of the Investigational New Drug (IND) stage as well as those products which already have approved therapeutic indications.  Prior to the submission of the proposal, the offeror must have met with the appropriate review division at the FDA to consult on the appropriate path for approval of their respective therapeutic for use in pathologies known to be associated with, or as components of, Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS).  It is the goal of BARDA to place in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) a Final Drug Product (FDP) which may be used for therapy of neutropenia in human subjects associated with whole body acute exposure to ionizing radiation exceeding 2 Gy.

The desired product that will be acquired with this contract must be able to support a public health emergency.  The current post-event capabilities of the USG medical emergency personnel to organize, respond, triage, and begin treating patients victimized by a radiological or nuclear event is estimated at no less than 24 hours.  Thus an obligation of this acquisition is to acquire products that have demonstrated efficacy in treating neutropenia (i.e., increase in the peripheral blood neutrophil counts) in appropriate animal models (FDA Animal Efficacy Rule, was established in 2002; see:  Federal Register 67: 37988-37998, May 31, 2002; 21 CFR 601.90 for biologics, and, 21 CFR 313.600-650 for drugs; (with possible human subject studies, if applicable), when administered at a minimum of 24 hours, and preferably greater than 48 hours, following acute exposure to ionizing radiation, and with no pre-exposure prophylaxis.  Other requirements:  (1) delivery of 100,000 treatment courses for neutropenia; (2) Long-term storage temperature in the range of 2-8 degrees C; (3) A defined therapeutic regimen and dosing schedule for treatment of radiation-induced neutropenia; (4) Treatment of neutropenia arising from ARS with the FDP must result in a 30% increase in survival from lethal exposure to ionizing radiation relative to controls (i.e.,LD50, the dose of ionizing radiation which results in 50% lethality in untreated irradiated subjects), plus an increase in neutrophil count. (5) have an acceptable safety profile; (6) have a minimum expiry period of 36 months with 30 months remaining when delivered to the SNS; (7) support a CDC-held IND for contingency use or CDC-held pre-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) submission; (8) prior to the end of the contract the therapeutic must be approved or licensed (NDA or BLA) for use as a therapy for neutropenia in adults (age: 18-64 years) exposed to ionizing radiation, (9) The USG reserves an option for safety studies in normal geriatric and pediatric populations; and (10) The USG reserves the right to exercise options to procure up to an additional 100,000 treatment courses.  It is imperative that the Offerors to this RFP seek guidance from the FDA prior to submission of their proposals so the proposal may be aligned with current FDA policy, practices and guidance.

Additional details and requirements will be described in the Acute Radiation Syndrome solicitation, RFP HHS-BARDA-08-10 which will be made available electronically through FEDBIZOPPS on or about March 14, 2008.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal to be considered by the USG.  This notice does not commit the USG to the award of a contract.  Only written or email requests will be accepted directly from the requestor for this solicitation.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  All responses should be identified with the respective solicitation number RFP HHS-BARDA-08-10, name of company, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address of Point of Contact (POC), should be submitted to the Contracting Office address identified in this notice.  The contract award resulting from this solicitation will have an estimated award date of September 2008.

The Omaha District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is seeking information about potential sources interested and capable of providing services under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Construction Code 237120 (To be considered a small business under NAICS Code 237120 an offeror and/or its affiliates if applicable may not exceed a size standard $31M gross annual receipts over 3 fiscal years.) for Oil and Gas Pipeline and Related Structures Construction- Petroleum Bulk Stations and Terminals).  This RFI constitutes a market research tool for the collection and analyses of information to determine the capabilities and capacity of interested contractors to execute Military Fueling Systems construction in support for military customers, within the Department of Defense (Army, Air Force, Navy), including DESC/DLA, US Army Petroleum Center (US Army), HQ AFRC (Air Force Reserves), HQ AMC (Air Force), HQ ACC (Air Force), HQ PACAF (Air Force) and various other federal and local agencies requesting the services, as necessary.  The NAICS Code 237120 for Oil and Gas Pipeline and Related Structures Construction-Petroleum Bulk Stations and Terminals industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in one or more of the following: NAICS CODE 237120, Size Standard $31M.  This industry comprises establishments either large or small, primarily engaged in the construction of oil and gas lines, mains, refineries, and storage tanks.  The work performed may include new work, reconstruction, rehabilitation and repairs.  Specialty trade contractors are included in this group if they are engaged in activities primarily related to oil and gas pipeline and related structures construction.  All structures (including buildings) that are integral parts of oil and gas networks (e.g. storage tanks, pumping stations, and refineries) are included in this industry.  Illustrative Examples: Distribution line (gas and Oil, construction), Oil refinery construction, Gas main construction, Petrochemical plant construction, Gathering line (gas and oil field construction), Pumping station (gas and oil transmission construction), Natural gas pipeline construction, Storage tank, natural gas or oil tank farm or field construction, Natural gas processing plant construction.  SCOPE OF SERVICES STATEMENT OF WORK:--The scopes of work will include, but not be limited to construction: replacement of aging fuel components; repair of storage tanks and containment areas, providing systems upgrade and maintenance and the applicable design to support the aforementioned construction identified in compliance with all state and federal regulations.  It is anticipated that a majority of the task orders will be fixed price.  There is the potential for some cost reimbursement type contract actions.  The nature of the military fuel systems mission is such that the nature and size of requirements are very unpredictable.  As needs are identified, corrective measures must be implemented quickly.  It is anticipated that the majority of the work will consist of Tank Cleaning, Inspection, and Steel Fuel Tank Rehabilitation, which consists of three (3) phases to be accomplished for each fuel tank: a. Tank Cleaning. In association with API 653 Tank Inspections and tank access regulations, the sludge in tanks will need to be removed and disposed of in accordance with all Federal, State, local and specific Military installation requirements.  Including, but not limited to, adequate ventilation and other health and safety requirements in accordance with OSHSA and USACE standard safety requirements.  After the cleaning the tank, it will then require and internal inspection.  The Contractor shall be required to show experience for required Tank Cleaning of tanks in support of the Department of Defense.  The Contractor shall follow established API 653 Inspection protocols as well as OSHA and USACE standards for the execution of this work and generate appropriate documentation.  b. API 653 Inspections. Inspection to the requirements of Standard API-653, latest edition, Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration and Reconstruction, including:  API-653 C-1 & C-2 Checklists and; all amendments, which are required to be performed every 10 years (minimum).  The inspector shall exhibit experience with aboveground storage tanks, cut and cover tanks and underground fuel storage tanks used for aviation fuels.  The API 653 inspector utilized shall be a certified American Petroleum Institute (API) tank inspector.  Certification shall be in accordance with API-653 Appendix D - Authorized Inspector Certification.  The Inspector shall also be a state-certified inspector in the state where the tank is located, if required.  Tank lining inspection shall be performed by a certified American Petroleum Institute (API) tank inspector.  The API inspector shall furnish a listing of API 653 Out-of-Service inspections done during the past two years including:  tank owner, location, size, capacity, construction, and product stored.  The tank evaluation report provided shall be certified by a registered professional engineer.  Experience with UT readings, vacuum box test, Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) technology is required.  c. Steel Fuel Tank Rehabilitation:  Steel Fuel Tank Rehabilitation will include revisions to stilling wells, modification to appurtenances, repair of corroded material, bottom replacement, etc.  Contractors will be required to demonstrate that they have experience in rehabilitation of 5,000 barrel or larger fuel storage tanks (as a minimum) on API 650 Fuel Storage Tanks.  Specific Requirements include:  Project locations may exist at all DOD installations, CONUS (Contiguous 48 States) plus possible locations in Alaska and Hawaii.  Construction requirements include fast track scheduling and performance, with incidental design.  All work must be performed to API, State and Federal requirements.  An offerers experience as a prime contractor, self performed the work, will be evaluated more favorably than that for which the offeror acted as a designer, sub-contractor, consultant or material supplier to another prime contractor.  TYPES OF CONTRACTS  Best practices and lessons learned from past operations success include competition, socio-economic participation, service provider capability of both fixed price and possible cost reimbursement type contracts and advanced contracts commonly known as multiple award task order (MATOC) contracts (multiple awards of MATOC contracts under a single solicitation for the same services to two or more sources).  The Government currently anticipates awarding multiple contracts to large and small businesses.  Contracts may be awarded on a regional basis to support small business as appropriate.  It is anticipated that a majority of the task orders will be awarded fixed price and thus require payment and performance bonding.  All sub-categories of small businesses are being considered during our market research phase.  Based upon approval, it is projected that each contract awarded will have a basic ordering period of two (2) years with one additional option period of three (3) years, for a total of five (5) years of performance.  Contractors are required to be registered in Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for receiving an award of any of these contracts (see CCR website at www.ccr.gov)..Multiple Geographic Regional contracts are being considered, they include the following states as follows:  1. Northeast (NE): Connecticut; Delaware; District of Columbia; Maine; Maryland;  Massachusetts; New Hampshire; New Jersey; New York; Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; Vermont; Virginia; West Virginia.  2. Southeast (SE): Alabama; Arkansas; Florida; Georgia; Kentucky; Mississippi; North Carolina; South Carolina; Tennessee.  3.

CONUS + AK: (Contiguous 48 states plus Alaska).  9. CONUS+ AK+HI: (Contiguous 48 states plus Alaska and Hawaii).  Task orders will be issued primarily utilizing firm-fixed-price procedures however; task orders for cost-reimbursement may also be utilized dependent on the nature of the requirement.  Separate contracts most likely will be awarded for cost reimbursement type task orders.  All task orders will be conducted in coordination with the geographic USACE Major Subordinate Command (MSC) and USACE District Offices.  It is estimated that individual task orders will range from $50,000 up to approximately $5 million.  A firm may have multiple project task orders issued to them.  The Government anticipates an individual task order for a typical tank cleaning to be approximately $500k, a typical inspection package to be approximately $500k, and a typical Tank Rehabilitation package to be between $1-3 Million.  Bonding will be required per task order (for firm fixed price orders), it is anticipated that there will be multiple task orders executed concurrently to an awarded contractor at any given time.
