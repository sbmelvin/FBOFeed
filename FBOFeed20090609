<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology. The technical concepts should be clearly defined and developed. The technical approach must be sufficiently detailed to support the proposed concepts and technical claims. (2) Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge to establish that the offeror has credible capability and experience to complete the proposed work. (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness. (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.

<DESC>TITLE:  NNA06BC19C, ELoret CorporationNASA/ARC has a requirement to extend the performance period of the Aeronautics andExploration Mission Modeling and Simulation (AEMMS) Service Contract for an additionalseven months; said extension will consist of one 6-month performance period and one1-month option period. This extension will provide on-going mission critical supportpending completion of the procurement process and award of the follow-on contract. Amodification reflecting this extension will be issued on or before June 30, 2009, whichis the expiration date of the current contract. NASA/ARC intends to extend the period of performance of contract NNA06BC19C, which wasawarded to Eloret Corporation on May 19, 2009. This award was the result of full and opencompetition, after exclusion of sources, to a small business. The current contractconsists of a four (4) year performance period, commencing from July 1, 2005, to June 30,2009.  The extension of the contract would result in a four (4) year, seven (7) monthperformance period, including the basic requirement and all options,  This extension iswithin the five year limit on terms of service contracts allowed by FAR 17.204(e) and NFS1817.204(e)(iii).  NASA is using the authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition provided by 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The AEMMS contract includes mission-critical analytical andexperimental support for various NASA programs, including CEV Aerosciences and ThermalProtection System Insight and Oversight, CLV risk analysis, and, under the ARMDHypersonics Project, TSTO concept design in partnership with the US Air Force.	The AEMMScontract supplies NASA Ames with engineering and science services, including vehiclemodeling and analysis, and analytical software tool development.  Personnel skill setsrequired include staff engineers, research and development scientists, computationalfluid dynamics experts, and IT support staff.	Because Eloret possesses unique expertisein meeting the requirements of the Center, no alternate source could adequately providethis support during this brief extension period. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intendsto solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Thepurpose of this action is to bridge the performance period between the end of the currentcontract and the anticipated award of the follow-on requirement. Procurement activity forthe follow-on contract has been initiated under NNA09274979R-NCV and market research hasbeen performed. The follow-on contract will be solicited on a competitive basis. It is the intent of the Government to award this action on a sole source basis as theaward to another source at the same time the recompete is in process would result insubstantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government'srequirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice issolely within the discretion of the Government.  Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested parties may submit their capabilities andqualifications to perform the effort IN WRITING to the identified point of contact notlater than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 15, 2009. Such communication ofcapabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Oral communicationsare not acceptable in response to this notice.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.

The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.    (c)  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.

<ARCHDATE>07242009
<CONTACT>Jim McNulty, 267-3626

<a href="mailto:jim.mcnulty@faa.gov">jim.mcnulty@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1, FAA is conducting market research to improve the Agency's understanding of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) systems that may be able to satisfy all, or a portion, of the FAA's requirements for a Unified Contracting System (UCS).  The FAA is also interested in receiving information on specially developed solutions for similar requirements (relative to automation of government contracting processes).  This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposal (RFP).  Any information provided in response to this announcement will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if properly marked.  Participation is not a promise of future business with FAA, and costs associated with any submission to FAA are solely at the interested vendor's expense.   
In an effort to improve FAA's ability to procure items in the most effective and efficient manner possible, FAA is researching the market for systems that can support the FAA procurement life-cycle.  Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:
	Electronic Procurement/Contracting with electronic/digital signature	Automated Role-based workflow	Interface capability with other systems, to include procurement/accounting systems	Routing capability/business process automation	Information sharing/collaboration (for both internal and external users)	Electronic document management	Reporting and metrics	Ability to be tailored to FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS)
Attached to this announcement is a draft System Boundary Document (SBD) outlining the basic requirements of the FAA for the Unified Contracting System (UCS).
Responses to this market survey must be received by COB Thursday July 9, 2009.  All submittals must be sent via e-mail to Jim McNulty, at Jim.McNulty@faa.gov and must include the following information:  
	Vendor Information:o	Name of Companyo	Addresso	Phone and Fax Numbero	Point of Contacto	E-mail Addresso	Business Size Status (e.g. SEDB/8(a), Small Business, SDVOSB, Other than Small)	A written summary of the Commercial, Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products you have that meet the requirements in the draft SBD, and to what degree the COTS products actually meet the stated requirements as defined in the draft SBD (Limit to 10 pages).	Available commercial pricing and licensing structure information for the COTS software product(s) that meet the UCS requirements as defined in the draft SBD.  	A list of five government customers for whom you have deployed the commercial product(s) including the name of the agency, name of a specific point of contact (POC) for each customer, phone number (for each customer POC), and e-mail address (for each customer POC).  	A written summary of any specially developed system (or solution) relative to automation of a government agency's contracting processes and systems and how that relates to the FAA's requirement (as described in the draft System Boundary Document).  	Detailed description of system architecture and hardware platform requirements to deploy the cited COTS software products (or specially developed solution) to meet the UCS requirements defined in the draft SBD.  	Any written comments and recommendations on the draft SBD itself (Limit 5 pages).
FAA will formally respond to questions for this market research announcement.  Please submit all questions via e-mail to Giles Strickler at Giles.Strickler@faa.gov (with a cc copy to Jim McNulty at Jim.McNulty@faa.gov).  Questions must be submitted on or before COB Tuesday June 23, 2009.  The FAA will publish questions along with the FAA's responses.   The FAA will endeavor to have the questions and FAA's responses posted on or before Tuesday June 30, 2009.  An "Interested Vendor List" will be published upon completion of the market research announcement period and will also be published with the actual Screening Information Request (SIR) should the FAA decide to pursue a SIR for this requirement.  
For the purpose of supporting potential teaming and subcontracting, the FAA plans to publish the list of companies (and products) that respond to this market research announcement.  For ease of reference, we shall refer to this as the "Interested Vendors List."  Respondents to this announcement must indicate in their response if they do NOT want the name of their company (and product and POC data) published in the List of Interested Vendors.  
The FAA is in the market research phase for this requirement.  As such, the FAA reserves the right to contact some, all, or none of the respondents to this announcement to obtain additional information regarding the commercial products described in the responses.  
At this stage of the process, the FAA is not fully cognizant of the different COTS products that can satisfy this requirement.  That is the primary reason for this announcement (to gain further knowledge in that regard).  At this juncture, however, we are unsure of the amount of integration and "modifications" to COTS products that may be required to meet this requirement.  For that reason, the System Boundary Document (SBD) describes some practices that may be considered more closely related to a developmental or major system contract.  The FAA will make decisions on those issues before a SIR is actually issued (if the decision is made to issue a SIR for this requirement).

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to make notice that the Forest Service contemplates releasing a RFQ solicitation numbered AG-0109-S-09-0012 on or about June 24, 2009 for the Cooper Creek Manual Fuel Reduction project.
  
The purpose of this contract is to reduce wild land fire potential near high-use portions of the Community of Cooper Landing, provide for firefighter safety, and secure a safe ingress and egress route to the Kenai Peninsula.  Spruce trees across Alaska have been killed in large numbers by the spruce bark beetle, leaving dead trees across the landscape and creating a high risk for wild land fire.  Implementation of these treatments would substantially reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire igniting or carrying through these portions of the Chugach National Forest.  This will be a manual fuel reduction project.

The project area is located on Chugach National Forest, Seward Ranger District in Alaska.  The Cooper Creek project is adjacent to Cooper Landing and Sterling Highway, location description is T. 4 N., R. 3 W, Section 7, 8, 18.  

The period of performance will be through October 31, 2010.
Award of this project will be accomplished under 100% Hub Zone Small Business Concern set-aside.

The solicitation and drawings will be available for downloading at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about June 24, 2009.  Offers will be due approximately 30 calendar days after the solicitation issue date.  It will be the responsibility of the bidder to check FedBizOpps for any amendments to the solicitation or this announcement. 

PLEASE DON'T RETURN THIS NOTICE TO US TO RECEIVE THE SOLICITATION.  GO TO FEDBIZOPPS TO DOWNLOAD THE SOLICITATION.

AUTOMATIC NOTIFICATION:  By registering to receive notification on posted synopses, you will be automatically notified via email of any changes to the project.

The selected A-E may be required to participate in a pre-fee meeting within seven days of notification and provide a fee proposal within ten days of the meeting.  The contract will be of the Indefinite Quantity type where the work will be required on an as needed basis during the life of the contract providing the government and contractor agree on the amount.  Each project contract will be a firm fixed price A-E Contract.  The Government will determine the delivery order amount by using rates negotiated and negotiate the effort required to perform the particular project.  The contract term will be a base year and two one-year option years.  The Government reserves the right to exercise the option years to extend the contract term.  The est! imated annual fee for any year is $2,500,000 and estimated per project is $1,200,000.  The total fee for the contract term shall not exceed $7,500,000.  The Government guarantees a minimum of $10,000.  There will be no future synopsis in the event the options included in the contract are exercised.  Estimated construction cost of project is between $500,000 and $25,000,000.  Estimated date of contract award is September/October 2009.  Proposals may be subject to an advisory audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.  
The following selection evaluation criteria, in relative order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of A-E firms: 
(1) Professional qualifications of firm and/or staff proposed in designing wastewater/potable water collection and treatment system, site development including roadways and drainage systems, and solid/hazardous waste collection and disposal systems including subsurface environmental investigations and designing in the Pacific basins and/or tropical environments similar to Hawaii, Guam and Pacific Ocean areas; 
(2) Specialized recent experience and technical competence of firm and/or particular staff members in designing wastewater/potable water collection and treatment system, site development including roadways and drainage systems, and solid/hazardous waste collection and disposal systems including subsurface environmental investigations and designing in the Pacific basins and/or tropical environments similar to Hawaii, Guam and Pacific Ocean areas.  List a maximum of ten (10) relevant projects completed in the past ten years which best describe experience for this criterion; 
(3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; 
(4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; 
(5) Knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying sustainability concepts and principles to facilities and infrastructure problems through an integrated design approach; 
(6) A-E's quality control program experience; 
(7) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; 
(8) Extent to which firms identify and commit to small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small business (HUBZoneSB), historically black college or university and minority institution (HBCU/MI) and veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) in performance of this Contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor;  
(9) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense shall also be considered, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of Department of Defense A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had Department of Defense contracts.  
Include a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection criteria on the SF 330, Part 1, Section H.  If necessary, continue on plain bond paper.  For selection criterion (3), the government will also evaluate each firm's past performance and performance rating(s) from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) during the evaluation process, which can affect the selection outcome.  For selection criterion (8), the Government will evaluate proposals based on two Sub-factors:  (A) Past performance in Utilization of Small Business Concerns and (B) Participation of Small Business Concerns in this Project.  The Government will also evaluate firms by:  In support of Sub-factor (A), (1) the offeror shall provide historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, and SDVOSB over the past three years showing dollar value, percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to large businesses, SB, SDB! , WOSB, HUBZoneSB, SDVOSB, and HBCU/MI; (2) Information on national awards received within the past five years for outstanding support to SB concerns.  National awards received within the last five years will be considered more favorably than national awards beyond five years; (3) Information showing ratings received on completed projects with regards to the firms implementation of subcontracting plans; (4) Information on any existing, planned or pending mentor-protege agreements under either the DOD or SBA 8(a) Programs; (5) Information on use of Community Rehabilitation Program organizations certified under the Javits Wagner O Day Program by the National Industry for the Severely Handicapped (NISH) or the National Industry for the Blind (NIB); and (6) Final SF 294s on projects completed within the past 5 years, and if subcontracting goals were not met, provide an explanation.  In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each subconsultant by name, discipline ! and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.  The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contracts per fiscal year are 23% to SB; 5% each to SDB and WOSB; 3% each to HUBZone SB, VOSB and SDVOSB; and 5% to HBCU/MI.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 09 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 77.51% to SB, 16.18% to SDB, 14.53% to WOSB, 1.42% to HUBZone SB and 0.14 % to SDVOSB.  If the offeror is unable to meet the minimum targets, an explanation should be provided, stating what actions were taken to satisfy the minimum target and how such actions failed to meet the objective.  FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns states in part; the Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performanc! e.  If the offeror does not intend to subcontract or meet the NAVFAC small business subcontracting goals, provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as a HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  For Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Certifications, effective October 1, 2008, the offeror may accept a self-certification from its SDB subcontractors as defined in 13 CFR 124.1002.  All contractors are advised that registration in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database is required prior to award of a contract, refer to FAR 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (APR 2008).  Failure to ! register in the DOD CCR Database may render your firm ineligible for award.  For more information, check the DOD CCR Website at http://www.ccr.gov.  The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) will require the use of On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process.  Offerors are required to complete the ORCA on-line via website http://orca.bpn.gov.  Refer to FAR 52.204-8 Annual Representations and Certifications (FEB 2009).  The selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract.  This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents (DD1391), facility sitting studies, environmental assessments, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost.  The prime firm and consultants for this contract will be required to perform throughout the contract term.  A-E firms meeting the requirem! ents described in this announcement are invited to submit a completed Standard Form 330, Architect Engineer Qualifications.

Note:  The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, Rhode Island is NOT accepting quotes or proposals via submission through NECO.

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport intends to award on a sole source basis a Firm Fixed Price type contract to L-3 Communications Corp, Sylmar, CA to support the USV Dipping Sonar (UDS) Mission Systems Integration onto the EDM Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) and to conduct an Installation and Checkout (INCO) test, checking out the hydraulic, power, hardware mounting and software interfaces. The period of performance is three months from the date of award.  L-3 Communications, Ocean Systems Division and Dynacon designed, fabricated and delivered the new Launch and Handling System (L&HS) to meet the deployment and retrieval requirements of the USV as an Advanced Development Model (ADM).  The Helicopter Long-Range Active Sonar (HELRAS) non-developmental hardware items (CAP, CIPS, SU and Cable and Reel) and the interface between the L&HS and the Common Acoustic Processor (CAP) were also developed by L3 and Dynacon.  The Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Anti-Submarine W! arfare (ASW) UDS Helicopter Long-Range Active Sonar (HELRAS) L&HS uses proprietary technology to deploy and retrieve the HELRAS Submersible Unit (SU). Additionally, an as-built drawing package for the L&HS and training material was not procured under the existing contract.  Therefore, either significant reverse-engineering efforts of the existing ADM version would be required, or an entirely new engineering effort would have to be undertaken. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normal! ly be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Additional details will be provided upon issue of RFQ N66604-09-Q-3883, which, in accordance with FAR 5.203(a) & (h). is anticipated to be on or about 06/12/2009.  Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating of DO-C9 applies. For information on this acquisition please contact Michael Broomfield at 401-832-8469,  michael.h.broomfield@navy.mil.

<ARCHDATE>06092010
<CONTACT>Jerry L Riles, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-767-0667, Email jerry.riles@nrl.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to negotiate a contract on the basis of Other Than Full and Open Competition IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source. NRL will negotiate with Orbit FR, 506 Prudential Road, Horsham, PA 19044, for upgrade to an existing compact range antenna and Radar Cross Section (RCS) measurement system hardware to increase its frequency range to include the 18 to 40 GHz region. In order to achieve this frequency range, a new set of hardware and applicable software is required, which includes: Pulse modulator/downconverter RF hardware; New set of antennas; New Signal Source; Associated RF cabling; Integration into existing hardware; System Software capable of utilizing existing measurement software package; Associated Pre/Post surveys, design and engineering, drafting, on-site installation, site verification test, and documentation. The system is required to increase the frequency capability of existing hardware that will integrate and operate with existing government equipment.  The Contractor is the only company that can provide a full turn key system capable of meeting NRLs requirement for integration into our existing system(s). The existing equipment uses proprietary software for which only the original company can provide the services that can meet NRL requirements.  The proposed contractor developed the current software that is used to run all of the RF equipment in the NRL RF Anechoic Chamber.  Without this software, having different control software would impact all of the RCS testing that is performed within the range.  Since this new software has the capability of utilizing various parts of the existing software, NRL is not required to purchase a completely new RCS measurement package.  Without this seamless integration of software, the ability to make RCS measurements over a wide-range of frequencies will be severely impacted due to the additional time necessary to perform these measurements.  Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.

<DESC><p>The Smithsonian Institution's (SI) National Zoological Park (NZP) is renewing its Seal and Sea Lion facilities and site.&nbsp; The existing Seal and Sea Lion exhibit was designed in 1977 as an anchor exhibit for the zoo's Beaver Valley.&nbsp; The 2787 square meter (30,000 sf) facility was built in 1978, and includes individual exhibit pools for seals and sea lions, separate holding pools for both species, and a large structure housing the life-support systems, maintenance, storage, and support operations.&nbsp; Age and technology advances have left the Seal and Sea Lion Life-Support Systems and the associated facilities in need of major revitalization so that current USDA and AZA standards for the care of marine mammals may be met.&nbsp; In addition, the pathway through the valley and exhibit area is steep and has numerous cross-slopes, making it difficult for people with disabilities and families with strollers to traverse.&nbsp; The underwater viewing area is also inaccessible to visitors with disabilities. This renewal project makes improvements and modifications to bring the facility into compliance with CFR Title 9 volume 1 - Specifications for the Humane Handling, Care, Treatment, and Transportation of Marine Mammals.&nbsp; Furthermore, universal accessibility is achieved in all public areas of the site.</p>
<p>Work under this project includes: tree protection, protection of adjacent live-animal exhibits, an addition to and modification of the existing life support system building, new life support equipment, replacement of two exhibit pools, four holding pools, construction of a new amphitheater and under water viewing area, site retaining walls, accessible pathways, upgrade of utilities in Beaver Valley, a small food service cafe, faux rockwork, visitor and animal barrier systems, landscaping and other work as described in the construction documents.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian Institution is interested in selecting the most qualified companies for this project. The information you provide in the attached Qualification Statement ("Statement") will be the basis for the evaluation of your Company. The prequalification of contractors is a highly competitive process.&nbsp; Only those entities that provide superior experience performance and capabilites can attain "most qualified" and become pre-qualified.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Philadelphia District, Corps of Engineers, is issuing a negotiated, best value RFP (Request for Proposal) to acquire emergency power support services.  The selected offeror(s) will be required to provide emergency power support, worldwide, in support of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers response to military contingencies.  Such support may be provided through the lease of contractor furnished equipment, the operation and maintenance of Government furnished equipment, or a combination of both.  The successful offeror(s) also will be required to replenish BOM (Bill of Materials) expended by the Government.  There are six primary, geographic areas to be supportedArea 1: Europe (including Mediteranean rim countries), Area 2:  Remainder of Africa, Area 3: Central Asia (including but not limited to: Afghanistan, Uzebekistan, Krygystan, Kahzikstan, and Pakistan), Area 4: Southeast Asia (Thailand, Phillipines), Area 5: Republic of Korea, Area 6: Central America (includes but is not limited to Mexico, Honduras, Belize, and Panama) and Area 7: South America.  An offeror may propose on a single area, a combination of areas, or all areas.  In order to be eligible for award of an area (or areas), prices must be submitted on all line items for the area (s).  Failure to submit a price on all line items in an area may cause rejection of the offer.  The procurement is being conducted as a best value acquisition under Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  The base performance period will be one calendar year.  Options to extend the performance period up to four additional years are also included in the solicitation.  The maximum contract ceiling for the resultant award(s) is $500 million for the base and all options.  Proposals will be evaluated for completeness in satisfying the requirements of the RFP.  The proposals will be ranked on the basis of the following factors:  (a) past performance and experience, (b) technical ability (comprised of contractor furnished equipment/product listings/catalogs, the offerors management plan, and locations of the offerors primary place of business and field offices),  (c) extent of subcontracting, and (d) price.   Past performance and experience and technical ability are of equal weight and are each more important than the extent of subcontracting.  The extent of subcontracting is more important that price; however, price remains a significant factor. The procurement is unrestricted and the applicable NAICS code is 221119 with a size standard of 4 million megawatt hours (a firm is small if, including its affiliates, it is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, and/or distribution of electric energy for sale and its total electric output for the preceding fiscal year did not exceed 4 million megawatt hours).  The solicitation will be issued on, or about, 22 June 2009 with proposals due by 4:00 p.m., local time, 22 July 2009.  Solicitation documents will only be available via the Web, hard copies will not be available.

If any offeror information changes during the advertisement period, offerors are responsible to make changes to their user profile on the Internet.  Failure to make changes in their user profile may cause a delay in receiving the solicitation and any amendments.  Offerors are responsible for printing paper copies of the solicitation. Bonding is not required.  Multiple awards may be made.  All offerors must be registered in the DoDs Central Contract Register before award, as required by DFARS 204.7300 and, for US firms, must comply with VETS-100 annual reporting as required by FAR 22.1310(b).

The Pearson Engineering Breaching System consists of the following subsystems:  Lane Marking Subsystem (LMS), with left and right components; High Lift Adapter (HLA) subsystem with chassis hydraulics; Full Width Mine Plow (FWMP) subsystem with blast resistant upgrades and HLA modifications; Surface Mine Plow (SMP) subsystem with HLA modifications; Rapid Ordnance Removal Subsystem (RORS) with HLA modifications; and a Dozer Blade subsystem with HLA modifications. All of the above subsystems include associated mounting hardware, cables, hydraulic lines, and fittings necessary t! o fully install and operate the subsystem.  Integration of any other breaching system would require new hardware design, a new integration effort, and a new test series, all adding significant costs and schedule delays to the ABV program.  It is necessary to procure from the original equipment manufacturer Pearson Engineering Ltd (PEL) to avoid any stoppage in production of the ABV. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only Pearson Engineering Ltd (PEL), under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 since they are the sole manufacturer and technical services provider for this equipment.  The contract term will be three (3) years from date of contract award.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 333298, number of employees is 500. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, South Texas Veterans Healthcare System, Audie L. Murphy Division, intends to award a sole source consignment contract with 1 base year and (4) one-year options for renewal to MAQUET Cardiovascular LLC for an inventory of vascular grafts to be used for vascular system repairs.   MAQUET Cardiovascular LLC will provide VAS Abdom/Thorac Grafts and VAS Peripheral Grafts under this consignment agreement.  The manufacturer of this brand name was found to provide the products that best meet the salient properties as determined by the STVHCS Surgical Department in meeting the needs of patient care. The MAQUET Cardiovascular Hemashield graft, according to the journal of Vascular Surgery is the only graft on the market that is collagen impregnated.  After implantation, the body recognizes the implant as natural and allows uniform tissue in growth into the graft within the Aorta.  Also, the collagen found with these grafts comes from only one source.  This is considered to be a point of quality control.  MAQUET Cardiovascular LLC also offers the only full line needed to include anatomically correct sizing in bifurcated sizes.  They also offer specialty branched grafts for open thoracic aneurysm repairs.  This agreement is being conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation subpart 13.501(a)(1)(ii), test program, using simplified acquisition procedures.  This sole source consignment agreement is under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5) and 38 U.S.C. 8123.  This notice is being provided in accordance with OFPP Memorandum dated April 17, 2006, Publication of Brand Name Justifications.

                     The Transparency, Accountability and Performance (TAP) Project 

The purpose of this solicitation is to improve the Agency’s overall performance and promote increased transparency and accountability in performance management reporting. The contract will support both Washington-based (USAID/W) and field-based USAID operating units  through what will be known as the Transparency, Accountability, and Performance (TAP) project.  

TAP will be an integrated and collaborative approach to results-based performance management known as Managing for Results (MfR).  MfR is the systematic process of monitoring the achievements of program and management operations; collecting and analyzing performance information to track progress towards planned results; using performance information and evaluations to influence decision-making and resource allocation; and communicating results attained, or not attained, to advance organizational learning and tell the Agency’s story. 

During the life of the TAP project, we anticipate increased attention to performance management from the Executive and Legislative branches.  Taken together with the recent introduction of legislation with an explicit emphasis on performance management in foreign assistance, USAID expects that Agency policies and procedures related to Managing for Results will continue to evolve. 

The contract is intended to assist the Agency in complying with program and management performance reporting requirements that derive from statutes and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and Congress.  To provide training and technical assistance to operating units to plan, implement and monitor programs; and evaluate progress toward achieving results.  To maintain data collection systems that facilitate analysis of and reporting on Agency-wide program and management performance results. Lastly, to improve Agency accountability by communicating results in a transparent manner.  

The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541611. This solicitation is for small business set-asides and will be an Indefinite Quantity Contract.  In accordance with FAR5.102 (d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only.  The full solicitation will be issued within ten business days.  Questions must be directed to Ray Carmichael, Contract Specialist, The U.S. Agency for International Development, M/OAA/GRO/ALPS, RRB 7-9-101, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20523, (Phone 202-712-4433; FAX 202-216-3396) email: rcarmichael@usaid.gov.

Military Trail, West Palm Beach, FL 33410 has the need for continuity of Home Oxygen Autotransfusion Services in accordance with Health Care Resources Contracting-Buying Title 38 U.S.C. as outlined in VA Directives 1663. VA Medical Center in West Palm Beach intends to make a sole source award to Dura Medical Equipment, Inc., a small business, for the purchase of Oxygen Services for the months of May and June 2009. Dura Medical Equipment, Inc. has proven to be capable of providing these services with outstanding performance ratings. In order to maintain uninterrupted patient care this has prompted contracting to expedite an order under FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source can provide these temporary services until a new contract can be establish.  At this time, Miami is working on a new consolidated contract, which includes WPB and Miami VA only. Based in past performance, and in order to maintain uninterrupted patient care is recommended to have Dura Medical Equipment, Inc, as a temporary solution until a permanent contract can be awarded by the Miami VAMC.

A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No solicitation is available at this time. ***No response to this special notice is necessary*** Questions must be submitted to Yamil O. Rodriguez, Contracting Specialist via e-mail at yamil.rodriguez@va.govJustification for other than full and open competitionWest Palm Beach VA Medical Center Contracts TeamSole Source Justification548-09-3-915-0083Home Oxygen Services(1)	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value and proposed contractor)VA Medical Center in West Palm Beach has a need for continuity of Complete home Oxygen service to VA patients in the home setting. The identified vendor will deliver to VA patient's residence the necessary and  identified equipment. Vendor will set-up and educate the patients on the equipment as well as perform a safety evaluation on the equipment and the home. Vendor will provide the VA with all required documentation as required by Joint Commission as well as the Prosthetics Service. Vendor will also be responsible for all education, plan of care as well as providing the patient with right and responsibilities. All of this must be documented at the Vendors  establishment in a 6 part folder and be secured. Refills and additional equipment will also be provided as needed. The estimated value is $54,000.00 (2)	Identify the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. (Check ONE only)X  FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements (Use the space in #3 to list vendor's unique capabilities)	 FAR 6.302-2 -- Unusual and Compelling Urgency (Use the space in #3 to describe the harm to theGovernment that will occur if award is delayed.)	 List other FAR Part 6 Exception to Competition	(3)	List proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition that supports the use of the authority cited above (Proprietary rights, unique attributes or capabilities, harm to the Gov if award is delayed etc)The company identified is located with 10 minutes of the VA and already has established inventory of VA owned equipment in place. They are the only oxygen company that will be able to meet all technical aspects and competencies necessary in order to fulfill VA's requirements to service all home oxygen patients' needs and requirements for both routine and emergent orders. (4)	Describe actions taken (if any) to remove or overcome any barriers to competition and to increase the possibility of competitive contracts for this effort in the future:A sole source vendor is being sought at this time as there is only one company that can meet the necessary medical and technical requirements. This is a temporary solution until the new contract solicitation is issued and awarded. (5)	Description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.In Accordance with FAR 10.01, the market survey confirmed the requirements are usual and customary in a  commercial marketplace and there are no unusual VA requirements that would exclude the procurement as a  commercial service. The home oxygen services provided by the current company, Dura Medical Equipment, Inc.  were under a VISN Consolidated contract issued by Miami VA Medical Center. The contract expired on February 22 2009. At this time Miami is working on a new consolidated contract which includes WPB and Miami VA only(6)	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition (Attach Continuation Sheets if more space is needed):Based in past performance, and in order to maintain uninterrupted patient care this has prompted contracting to  expedite a purchase order under the FAR 6.101 (a) and FAR 6.603.1. This is a temporary solution until the new contract solicitation is issued and awarded. I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.Technical personnelContracting Officer

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICITATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. The Space Development and Test Wing located at Kirtland AFB is looking for possible source to manufacture a fully mature, commercial Gyro-stabilized Antenna Motion Test Platform System to include the motion table, software package, commercial operating manual, installation and training to allow for validation of the proper stabilization functions of the Space Test Operation Squadron&rsquo;s (STOS) ocean going gyro-stabilized antenna system. This motion table system shall be capable of testing S-Band Transportable Ground System Ocean Going 1/Ocean Going 2 (STGS O1/O2) antenna systems to be accepted through an Engineering Review Board (ERB) for various missions. The motion table/platform system will be used to support any of the ocean going missions to simulate &ldquo;at sea&rdquo; environments for gyro-stabilized antennas. The existing capability gap is that there is no organic capability to verify that the gyro-stabilization hardware and software will properly track satellite booster vehicles and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites under varying levels and degrees of sea roll/pitch/yaw, also referred to as sea states. The inability to simulate rigorous operational settings prior to missions reduces Mobile Range Flights (MRF) sea based capability by 50%. The goal of the procurement of this motion table is to successfully test the ocean going antenna system for operational readiness and to determine antenna stabilization thresholds under various sea state conditions. The item provided must meet or exceed (Within the thresholds) the performance and physical standards listed in the attached purchase description. Interested parties are invited to submit a Statements of Capabilities (SOC) which includes the following information: 1) Company name, mailing address, points of contact, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses, 2) Business size classification, Large, Small, or Other along with cage code if available, 3) A brief overview of experience in the manufacture of exact or similar technologies, and 4) Product description with performance and physical parameters and a statement regarding current availability or average delivery time. Interested parties should submit SOC as listed above in electronic form to Katherine.shaw@kirtland.af.mil no later than COB&nbsp;23 Jun 2009. Questions should be directed to Danielle Shaw at the e-mail above or by phone at 505-853-3757.</p>

The objective of the future solicitation is to acquire support for the CTR office and associated Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) offices.

<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information.  This announcement IS NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) of any kind.  Further, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
All interested parties are advised that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI).  Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey/Request for Information submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense.
Previous market surveys have solicited responses pertaining to specific switch technologies and applications.  The FAA is now pursuing an end-to-end system approach to upgrade the aging National Airspace System (NAS) voice communications infrastructure in order to satisfy NextGen initiatives that require a networked infrastructure to support dynamic asset reallocation.  The NAS voice communications system consists of voice switching functions, radio control functions, and a telecommunications medium.
The upgrade will require a system with proven technology that ensures availability in both high traffic volume and emergency situations while maintaining current voice quality and latency standards.  The purpose of this Market Survey/RFI is:  to solicit information related to improving the Government's understanding of the current voice communications marketplace, to obtain information on available technology and innovative approaches that may fulfill its mission, and to gain insight into industry capabilities and best practices in regards to a voice system that provides flexibility for the NAS.  Vendors are welcome to invite the FAA to view demonstrations of any aspect of their representative solutions.  The FAA is contemplating a Contract Award date in FY11.
Attachment A provides background information on the current NAS voice communications system, concepts and ideas being studied by our European counterparts as well standards development by International bodies in support of Air Traffic Management communications to help gain insight into issues impacting its performance and long term supportability.  
Attachment B is the vendor response template.  Interested vendors are requested to provide full and complete responses to the items in Attachment B.  Special emphasis is being placed on identifying innovative communications solutions that will improve the quality of the FAA's Investment Analysis efforts and the forthcoming acquisition of a new state of the art voice communications system.
Respondents to the Market Survey/Request for Information may be requested to provide additional information at the option of the Government. No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise for future business with the FAA.  Information obtained from Attachment B will be used to support the development of an acquisition strategy for a national program supporting all NAS voice communications; to refine the Government's NVS business case; and resolve system issues to support a business decision. Respondents who have additional material to add to previous inquiries are invited to provide supplemental responses.  
All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 50 pages.  No type font less than 12-point may be used.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  If there are questions, please submit them to the FAA Contracting Office, Ken Carter, via e-mail at Kenneth.M.Carter@faa.gov and via telephone at 202-267-3012.  Responses to this RFI must be submitted by 3:00 p.m. on July 10 2009 but are welcome before the due date as well.
The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following email address: Kenneth.M.Carter@faa.gov.  Please submit in a portable document format (PDF), however, Microsoft Word is acceptable.  If you cannot respond electronically, please send to:

<DESC>Seeking Aviation Flight Service providers to support the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Hawaiian Islands and Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuges
This Request for Information (RFI) is intended to determine potential operators and aircraft solutions to meet the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) needs supporting the Hawaiian Islands and Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuges.  Interested vendors should submit information in response to the questions below considering potential aircraft, combinations of aircraft services (ie separate cargo/passenger flights, multiple aircraft types, etc), and potential costs to support the missions as described below.  This information may be used to develop a solicitation that encourages competition while being capable of meeting the requirements of the USFWS.
The USFWS is seeking one or several contractor operated and maintained aircraft with pilots needed for the transportation of Government personnel and/or cargo originating from Honolulu, HI.  Existing aircraft support is being provided by a G-1 aircraft but additional payload is needed.  The primary need for aircraft is to provide logistical support to the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge from Honolulu however additional support to other locations in the Pacific may also be serviced through the potential contract.  Midway lies 1250 miles northwest of Honolulu, Hawaii.  A potential hazard that must be considered is the presence of nesting colonies of seabirds on the island.  Approximately 2 million albatross may be present from November through July.  Other birds such as bonin petrels, white tern, black noddies, frigates and boobies are also present in substantial numbers during much of the year.  During the months of November through July most flights are at night to avoid birds strikes.  At a minimum aircraft must have a standard airworthiness certificate, seating for 19 passengers (removable for optional cargo hauling), a range of at least 1300 nautical miles, payload of 6500 pounds (with fuel for specified range), cruising airspeed of 250 KTS, and be capable of operating from a 7,900 ft paved runway at sea level at ISA +15 degrees with payload and fuel.  Freight may include food, diving gear, outboard motors, diesel engines, radio antennas, equipment parts, personal goods, mail, and maintenance equipment.  Over night stays at Midway Atoll may be required.  Aircraft and pilots must be certified and checkrided in IFR extended over water operations.  Certification at least under 14 CFR, Chapter 135, Air Taxi Operators and Commercial Operators is required.  Applicable NAICS code is 481211, Nonscheduled Charter Air Transportation. INTERESTED OFFERORS:  Please respond at minimum with the following information.  Additional information proposing different aircraft support solutions will also be considered.

This item is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), NEXRAD program, to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. BACKGROUND: The bargraph ammeter is a piece of installed equipment that was specified in the original design of the WSR-88D (Weather Service Radar). Initially, there were meters manufactured by three (3) vendors that met the requirements of the WSR-88D. However, the availability of these items has continued to decrease over the years. In June, 2008, the ROC evaluated potential products that could continue to support the NWS requirement. The Otek part was the only suitable substitute identified. SPECIFIC TECHNICAL FEATURES: Since this an installed instrument, the physical dimensions and connections are as critical to compatibility with the WSR-88D system as are the performance characteristics. The specific parameters for this application include: input power, power consumption, resolution, segments of resolution, linearity, input impedance, response time, overload tolerance, specified set points, alarms, connectors, and switch ranges. These special characteristics flow down from the WSR-88D specifications to ROC Drawing 2200303, Rev B. The NWS performed a market research and found all but the Otek part was eliminated by comparison to specified requirements. The Otek part was validated in testing at the ROC facility. The only alternative that could be taken to remove or overcome barriers to competition would be to compete new designs. However, the use of another manufacturer's bargraph ammeter would require extensive testing at the Government's expense whose costs could not be recovered by the difference in competitive pricing versus sole source. This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The anticipated award date shall be within 10 calendar days after the date of this publication. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide this product. Interested firms must submit support documents if providing or proposing to provide other than the specified part or a part that meets the same fit, form and function as the specified part number. Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other Government agency to which it has previously provided the item. Offerors may send their proposal to email address karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax to 816-274-6952 ATTN: Karen Christian. The NAICS code for this requirement is 334513. All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the Agency. All contractors doing business with the Central Region Acquisition Division (CRAD) must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) or certification of registration in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). This is a Government initiative that was designed by the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) to replace the paper Representations and Certifications (Reps &amp; Certs) process. No award can be made unless the vendor is registered with CCR. For more information and to register with the CCR and ORCA, please access the following websites: http://www.ccr.gov/ and http://www.bpn.gov. In order to register with the CCR and ORCA offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet number.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought synopsis for market research purposes. No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time. All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration. Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the availability of contractors with the technical expertise and administrative and management capability to perform the effort.
Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Sealift Support Program Office (SSPO) has a potential requirement for the redesign and fabrication of the new ELCAS fender pontoon connector system. If awarded, the contract will include the redesign of the fender pontoon connector system and the fabrication and installation of one connector system (two pontoons) for Government testing and evaluation.  The Government has one concept design that may be implemented, or the contractor may offer a different, more cost effective connector type.  Assuming the connector system is successful, the contractor will fabricate and install the new connector system for additional ELCAS Fender pontoons in inventory.
The existing connector system for the ELCAS (M) Fender Pontoons is based on the complicated connector system utilized in the pier and in the barge ferries.  It is a connector system that serves those purposes well, but is not well-suited to the fender system.  The fender system is subjected to the high dynamic forces of surf and swell, which with time and increased severity of the surf and swell causes the connector system of the fender pontoons to break apart.  As a result, the Navy has incurred excessive expense in the repair of the P40F Fender Pontoons due to structural damage to the pontoons.  It is expected that this can be improved by utilizing a new connection that is either more simple and robust, or alternatively is a more compliant, yet safe connection, that is focused more on the unique condition of the floating fender system.
This is a new procurement; it does not replace an existing contract. 
If you are interested in this effort, please submit a capability package to Mr. Michael Fanizzo at Michael.fanizzo@navy.mil. You may also call (202) 685 6017 with any questions.
The package should include the following information:1) the business name, address and type of business (Small Business, 8(a), etc.), cage code,2) a capability statement showing recent experience with similar work, and3) a point of contact, and their email address and phone number.

<DESC>DELIVERY OF BREAK-BULK AND ROLLING STOCK CARGO TO/FROM  WORLD-WIDE LOCATIONS (PRIMARILY CONUS) TO/FROM VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ USING A COMBINATION OF SURFACE (PRIMARILY OCEAN) AND AIR TRANSPORTATION

The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is conducting a market survey on industry capabilities and potential sources for intra-theater surface (primarily ocean) and air (multimodal) transportation of military break-bulk cargo to/from various destinations in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The Government is looking for commercial solutions to maximize the cost savings associated with surface (primarily ocean) transportation for the longest and safest portions of these movements, while capitalizing on the speed and safety of airlift to move designated break-bulk cargo to the final destinations in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Maps with detailed routing, stops, and mode changes should be included for every option presented, to include information on any proposed or considered teaming arrangements.  The Cargo Preference Act, Fly America Act, DoD airlift and DoD sealift policies shall apply to any requirement for ocean and air transportation of military cargo.  There is no solicitation package at this time.
 
This market research is designed to solicit ideas and opinions from experts in the ocean and air transportation industries to determine the level of interested sources and industry capabilities.  The Government is also interested in rough order of magnitude (ROM) pricing for a theoretical unit move.  The Government is neither negotiating nor calling for offers at this time.  This announcement is an expression of interest only and shall not commit the Government to pay for any response preparation expenses or make an award on the basis of this Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information synopsis.  Copies of information submitted by interested parties shall be reproduced and submitted to a USTRANSCOM team for review and shall be used to evaluate industry capabilities. If determined feasible after review and evaluation of the responses, the Government may develop a requirement in the future.  

USTRANSCOM is seeking information on industry capabilities and potential sources who can provide reliable and secure Time Definite Delivery, in-transit visibility (ITV) and end to end management of break-bulk military cargo from/to world-wide locations (primarily CONUS), to/from various locations in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The majority of cargo deliveries in Afghanistan will be to Bagram (OAIX) and Kandahar (OAKN) airfields with additional service to airfields in Iraq.  The military cargo may consist of a 1.1 to 1.4 hazardous classification.  Shipments from/to the origin to/from the various destinations in the region could eventually amount to approximately 10,000 tons, 304,000 square feet of break-bulk cargo and rolling stock.

USTRANSCOM encourages all interested companies to submit detailed responses that specifically outline your company’s ability to meet the following requirements:

1.  Accept cargo (on behalf of the Government) at the origin and to ensure delivery at the final destination.  The Government requires transit times between 15 to 20 days from origin acceptance (CONUS) to various locations within Afghanistan and Iraq.
2.  Provide real-time in-transit visibility compatible with command and control applications on cargo location and provide full access to the shipper and other Government employees designated by the Contracting Officer.
3.  Ensure cargo security during transport and at transloading points.
4.  Ensure cargo delivery for 95 percent of shipments by the required delivery date (RDD).
5.  If required, provide direct delivery to Forward Operating Bases.
6.  Initiate process improvements and other value added services.
7.  Provide end to end management with customized information management reports related to delivery time, delivery reliability, shipment volume and other criteria that characterize and to provide performance based views.
8.  Handle substantial increases in shipments (surge requirements) as needed for wartime and other contingencies.
9.  Provide security for cargo from origin to destination not including the air portion of travel.

Market Survey:

USTRANSCOM is asking for industry input and comment for this requirement, to include commercial best practices and logistics/transportation management capabilities.  All interested parties (including potential prime contractors, subcontractors, and/or teams) are strongly encouraged to submit a response to this RFI.  Responses should be concise and include the following responses:

1.  What type of comprehensive innovative alternatives does your company have?  
2.  What capability does your company have to perform the described services?
3.  If interested, would your company be interested in submitting a proposal for the described services?  If not, why?  If so, briefly describe your capabilities.
4.  What are the recommended commercial practices for these types of services? 
5.  What are the recommended methods used to secure cargo at transloading points?
6.  What are the methods/metrics the commercial industry uses for monitoring this type of performance?
7.  In a Performance Work Statement, what flexibility must the respondent have in order to propose the most effective and economical transportation operation?
8.  What data from the U.S. Government would be required to develop a proposal to manage and operate inbound and outbound transportation requirements?
9.  Describe the risks associated with this effort and how, if any, can they be mitigated?
10.  Provide a description of your company’s teaming and relationship management practices with sub-contractors along with your company’s understanding of the challenges and risks of operating successfully in the region.
11.  Are there any specific limits to your company’s capabilities?
12.  Does your company have experience in providing the described services with an operation similar in size and scope?  
13.  What are the largest projects your company has managed, either as a prime or subcontractor, to include shipping volumes, total revenue, performance goal results, and other metrics with regards to percentage of RDD met and how long did the relationship last?
14.  What is your company’s recommended commercial pricing structure for the described service?  
15.  What limiting factors, if any, exist?  
16.  Do you have any other concerns/comments or recommendations?
17.  ROM pricing for a typical unit move.  The ROM should cover the movement of 600 pieces of rolling stock from the port of Charleston, SC to Bagram (OAIX).  For purposes of the ROM pricing, 300 pieces would be Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles (MRAPs).  Approximate dimensions of the MRAPs would be:  Width – 108 inches, Height – 104 inches, Length – 233 inches, Weight – 38,000 lbs.  The remaining 300 pieces would be “heavy vehicles.”  Approximate dimensions of the heavy vehicles would be:  Width – 91 inches, Height – 75 inches, Length – 197 inches, Weight – 14,000 lbs.  Assume all the cargo would be available to lift from Charleston, SC on the same day.  Final delivery to Bagram would be staggered depending on your proposed airlift capacity and schedules, with all cargo being in-place within 30 – 45 days from ALD at Charleston.

Provide responses to erica.blake@ustranscom.mil and charles.burton@ustranscom.mil no later than close of business 8 July 2009.  No phone or FAX responses shall be accepted.  Please ensure “USTRANSCOM SEA-AIR TRANSPORTATION MARKET SURVEY” is listed in the subject line of your responses.

<DESC>The VA North Texas Health Care System, 4500 S. Lancaster Road, Dallas, TX  75216, is seeking sources to provide consulting services, as described in the attached Statement Of Work.  Parties capable of providing these services must respond in writing to the attention of the Contracting Officer listed in this announcement by June 15, 2009, at 2:00 PM Local Time..  Capable parties must also provide in writing, their business size and description/type.  This is the only notice of this procurement and no written solicitation will be available. STATEMENT OF WORK1.	SCOPEThe Veterans Affairs (VA) Network 17 Heart of Texas HealthCare Network is the Veterans Integrated Service Network 17 (VISN 17) consisting of full-service hospitals, psychiatric facilities, community living centers, research facilities, and rehabilitation facilities within three Healthcare Systems: VA North Texas (Dallas and Bonham), VA Central Texas (Temple and Waco), and VA South Texas (San Antonio and Kerrville).  VISN 17 also currently has Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in Fort Worth, Tyler (Camp Fannin), Dallas County Primary Care Network (PCN), Bonham Area PCN, Denton Area PCN, Decatur Area PCN, Eastland Area PCN, Tarrant County PCN, McAllen Satellite, Frank M. Tejeda Satellite, Corpus Christi Satellite, Harlingen, Victoria, Eagle Pass, Laredo, South Bexar County, Alice, Beeville, Kingsville, Uvalde, Austin Satellite, Palestine, Brownwood, Greenville Area PCN, Cleburne Area PCN, College Station, Cedar Park, San Antonio Area PCN, New Braunfels, San Antonio, and Sherman.    Comprehensive health care is provided through primary care, tertiary care, and long-term care in areas of medicine, surgery, psychiatry, physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurology, oncology, dentistry, geriatrics, and extended care.The VISN 17 Healthcare Centers are primary care and tertiary care facilities providing medical, surgical, psychiatric, and community care for Heart of Texas veterans as teaching hospitals which provide a full range of patient care services with state-of-the-art technology, as well as education and research. 2.	PURPOSEVISN 17 is continually striving to improve its patient care, patient satisfaction, patient education as well as employee morale and satisfaction throughout various divisions and programs.  The procedure and policy changes required to make improvements in these areas are among the specific focuses of this contract.  The anticipated result of any cultural transformation will include national designation as a patient-centered health care environment.  VA VISN 17 proposes to accomplish the above by entering into a Membership, as an Affiliate, consisting of one (1) base year with the Government's option to renew the contract for two (2) optional one-year (1) periods with Contractor International Member Network; the contractor (Contractor) program consists of a three (3) year implementation phase. The best healthcare delivery systems in the nation have embarked on a major cultural transformation that focuses on the concept of "patient-centered" care.  This relatively new concept requires that healthcare providers and institutions completely reevaluate how they deliver care.  They then implement new processes where care is focused on patient needs and desires; as opposed to the traditional methods of care delivery which are more focused on healthcare providers and the needs of the system of care delivery itself. It has been well demonstrated where such patient-centered cultures exist, patient outcomes and patient satisfaction increases dramatically.  In these environments, staff satisfaction is also enhanced resulting in highly significant improvements in staff recruitment and retention.  Additionally, the overall organization is able to function more effectively and efficiently, and operational costs can be dramatically reduced.  These are the goals and purpose of entering into a membership with Contractor. Contractor will provide the experts who are available to provide assistance in a number of ways to include:  direct, on-site consultation and guidance, oversight of the cultural transformation process, advice and consultation to leaders at all levels and ongoing-organizational assessment to determine the progress of the implementation.  3.

<DESC><p>Special Notice DARPA-SN-09-43: Enabling Stress Resistance Proposer's Day Workshop; DATE: July 1, 2009; REGISTRATION DEADLINE: June 23, 2009; TECHNICAL POC: <br />Dr. Amy A. Kruse, DARPA/DSO, Email: amy.kruse@darpa.mil; URL: www.darpa.mil/dso; Website Submission: https://dsobaa.sainc.com/
<p>In anticipation of a potential program on the topic of Enabling Stress Resistance, DARPA is hosting a Proposer's Day Workshop that will provide critical information on the program vision milestones, and opportunities associated with the development of an interdisciplinary team. The workshop will be held on July 1, 2009 in La Jolla, CA.</p>
<p>DARPA is seeking innovative approaches for creating a comprehensive, quantitative description of the impact of stress on the brain. This effort seeks to leverage cutting-edge technologies and recent advances in molecular neurobiology, neuroimaging and molecular pathway modeling as applied to animal models of acute and chronic stress. The objective of the effort is a proactive approach to stress mitigation, starting with development of a comprehensive understanding of the complex effects of multiple stressors on the brain. The program's ultimate goal is the development and implementation of cognitive, behavioral and/or pharmacological interventions that will prevent the deleterious effects of stress on the brain. DARPA envisions the creation of molecular mechanism &lsquo;teams' of researchers for a thorough investigation into the multiple pathways involved in the brain's response to acute and chronic stress as well as physical, social, cognitive and affective stressors. Although motivation for the effort is derived from stresses associated with the operational environment, this effort will involve animal systems only.</p>
<p>Recent technological developments in neuroscience present the opportunity for these challenges to be addressed as never before. Cutting edge molecular biological techniques coupled with in-vivo measurement technologies may allow for manipulation of the stress pathways and behavioral analysis in real-time. These powerful tools allow assessment of the effects of stress with extreme temporal and anatomical precision. The initial phase of the effort will also include a prediction/validation step which will require modeling and simulation capabilities in addition to the research efforts required to meet the program metrics.</p>
<p>DARPA anticipates that a highly interdisciplinary team, potentially composed of industry, small business, and academia, will be required to span the technical breadth of the program. Specifically excluded is research aimed at targeting a single molecule in response to a single stressor in an animal model. DARPA knows of no one molecular target that has been proven to fully alleviate stress induced cognitive dysfunction and illness in animals, thus, a comprehensive approach is necessary.</p>
<p>The teaming and information session will be held at the Estancia La Jolla Hotel, 9700 N. Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA, 92037 on July 1,2009 from 9:00AM ET until 5:00PM ET. The goals of the teaming and information session are: (a) to introduce the research community (industry, small business, academia, and Government) to the Enabling Stress Resistance program vision and goals; (b) to explain the mechanics of a DARPA Program and the milestones and metrics of this particular effort, and (c) to encourage and promote teaming arrangements among potential organizations that have the relevant expertise, facilities, and capabilities for executing a research and development program responsive to the Enabling Stress Resistance program goals. The teaming and information session will include overview presentations by Government personnel and a poster session to facilitate interaction and team building among the teaming and information session participants. Additionally, a teaming website is provided to facilitate these interactions and can be found at http://www.sainc.com/ESRTeaming.</p>
<p>Potential participants should note that formation of teams with sufficient expertise to address all technical areas, which will be detailed in an impending BAA, will be critical to the success of the program. DARPA will not be funding efforts that address only a subset of the challenges listed in the BAA. Appropriate teaming will be a critical element in responding to the DARPA Enabling Stress Resistance solicitation.</p>
<p>Enabling Stress Resistance Proposer's Day Workshop participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters describing areas of capabilities in order to facilitate communications, interactions, and teaming discussions during the poster session. Workshop details including registration, poster session, meeting location, and lodging are given on the Enabling Stress Resistance registration website at http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/view/index.asp?meetingid=681 .</p>
<p>There is no fee for the Enabling Stress Resistance Proposer's Day Workshop. Registration is limited by the venue capacity (maximum of 100 attendees, no more than 3 attendees per organization) and early registration is strongly recommended. The registration cutoff date is June 23, 2009, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first. Further administrative information is available from Ms. Grace Rigdon (Grace.Rigdon.ctr@darpa.mil). Additional technical information can be obtained from Dr. Amy Kruse (Amy.Kruse@darpa.mil). Please refer to the Enabling Stress Resistance Proposer's Day in your correspondence.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a request for proposals; any so sent will be returned. Nor does this announcement guarantee any funding should a Broad Agency Announcement be published related to these workshops.</p>

<DESC>Justification for Other Than Full and Open CompetitionPer the requirements set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Parts 6.302, 6.303, and 6.304 the following justification and approval is made regarding the procurement of a service contract with iCom International. This is sole source procurement and competitive procedures will not be used. The format for this justification is from the FAR Part 6.303-2 and presented In the format prescribed.1. Agency: U.S. Department of Veterans AffairsContracting Activity: VISN 20 Purchasing and Contracting, North Branch VA Puget Sound Healthcare System, Tacoma WA 981082. Nature and/or description of the action being approved. The proposed action is a sole source action to be awarded as a commercial contract to:iCom International, Inc 2718 Linden Drive: Boulder, CO 80304 Phone: 303-449-1197; Fax: 303-415-13663. A firm fixed price emergency contract is anticipated and will be issued pursuant to FAR Part 13.5. effective May 1, 2009 to June 30, 2009 for a total of $57,500 4. A description of the supplies or services required.The contractor will be responsible for the continued development, testing and ongoing implementation and maintenance of the Cardiac Cath Lab (CART-CL) application and database. The contractor will be expected to be an active participant/consultant with the CART-CL workgroup, participate in regular conference calls and weekly face-to-face meetings with the Clinical Director and other CART-CL staff. Services required from May 1 to June 30 include:Upgrade, enhancement and maintenance to the CART application, data repository, and website data interface.	Technical training and user support to all sites.	Development of interface for CART-CL Website with clinical/technical support, and documentation.5. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. The statutory authority allowing use of other than full and open competition for this requirement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency.Hans Gethoffer, iCom CEO and chief programmer, has provided a large portion of the design, development, and testing of CART-CL application and has been responsible for all of the installation related tasks from its inception of the CART-CL program in 2003 through the end of his previous contract period. He is uniquely qualified and authorized to maintain, update, and document the systems design of CART-CL. The architecture system iCom created allows changes and additions to the system to be quicklyimplemented and iteratively tested. This capability is necessary to support the dynamic clinical environment of VA cardiac oath labs.It is estimated to take two years to train another programmer and obtain authorization and certification from VA Office of Information and Technology. Valuable time and the financial resources expended to date would be lost. There is no other VA employee or vendor with the expertise and knowledge of the CART-CL system design and capabilities. There is no other vendor or employee that OI&T or ISS has both the level of access needed to fill this position and the knowledge of the CART-CL system.iCom has been responsible for distribution of all application updates to all 76 VA Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories. This is a very demanding and timely process that includes getting authorization to access particular file and VistA systems all 76 VA facilities, using specialized tools that Hans Gethoffer has developed to verify that new updates to the CART-CL application will work safely with each facilities systems, and distribution of all new updates over a single night to all VA facilities. Because there has been no contract in place, the CART-CL program has not been able to distribute any updates to the facilities using the CART-CL program since the end of the previous contractperiod. This puts the security of the CART-CL program at risk, and that risk increases with the time that the CART-CL program goes without the ability to provide updates to the field.6. Need for Emergency contractDelay to awarding this contract has already prevented the VA from providing regular updates and fixes to our users. The dynamic nature of the Cardiology department requires that the CART-CL program be easily and quickly updatable. If these delays continue, then cardiology departments across the VA will be forced to seek out alternative and potentially costly solutions to make up for deficiencies in the current version of the CART-CL system that are ready to be addressed with an update. CART-CL staff members are currently working on a solution to this problem, but this solution is weeks, if not months in the future.in addition, if a major security flaw in the CART-CL application were to be uncovered, we would be completely unable to correct the flaw and distribute an update to users in a timely Manner. Depending on the nature of the security flaw uncovered, this could expose the VA to:	Patient data records that the CART-CL system is responsible for being lost, exposed to unauthorized users, or destroyed.	Patients at risk of going undiagnosed or having unnecessary procedures performed with potentially life-threatening consequences7. Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a CBD notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and If not, which exception under 5.202 applies. A notice of intent to award sole source will be posted on FB0 on or about April 27, 2009.8. A determination that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. At a Minimum, a price analysis will be conducted to determine whether the price is fair and reasonable by requesting a listing of other customers they have provided similar services to. If a determination can not be made based upon this information the contractor will be required to submit information other than cost or pricing data to support further analysis.9. A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason  market research was not conducted. Market research was not conducted since this contractor, iCom International has done the development and testing of CART to date through VA contracts. To switch contractors in the midst of the development would be extremely detrimental to the success of this nationally Mandated project.10. Other support the use of other than full and open competition (Quantitative/Qualitative).Initiating a new five-year contract with iCom has been delayed since September 2008. Our acquisition request was contingent on getting approval through a newly implemented Ol&IT Approval Request System (ITARS), Staff members were not authorized to enter requests into !TARS until early November 2008 and it was February 2009 before the request received focal, VISN, and National 018,T approval. During this time, little progress on CART-CL application was possible. Work was limited to tasks VA CART-CL staff members were able to do without the contractors input and expertise. While some updates to the CART-CL application have been completed, a system to distribute those updates is still several weeks away.it is Imperative that an emergency contract is put in place to ensure that the CART CL application can be updated and this gap in our development process caused by the change over from service contract to 018,T contract is quickly and efficiently filled.A full and open acquisition will add several months to the process which the program an not sustain. in addition this would require, appropriate training, obtaining security clearances, and reproducing the tools and techniques that 1Corn is currently able to provide.11. A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisitioh. How this requirement was initially procured or how was Mom selected as the contractor? No other vendor has been identified that has the programming expertise, direct experience with the CART-CL system, or security clearance that 3Com has been given. iCom has been working with the CART-CL system for more than five years, and has the,exact qualifications, tools, and experience needed to fill this position.12. A statement of actions, If any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to  competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  No competition is planned. The costs Involved in seeking out a competing bid from another entity with ' the skills to cover this position, going through appropriate training, obtain security clearances, and reproducing the tools and techniques that 1Com already has provided for the CART-CL system for the past five years are prohibitive as long as 'Com is willing to provide the CART-CL program with these services.13. Requirements Certification:I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief./s/ Larry Bradbury, Acquisition Branch Mgr

<p>52.212-2<br />EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE</p>
<p>1. CERTIFIED GUNSMITH</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous (Best Value) to the Government price and other factors considered. Technical and Past Performance when combined are significantly more important than cost or price. However, as the Technical merit becomes equal, price will be the determining factor. The evaluation of this RFQ will be in accordance with Part 12 and Part 15 of the FAR.</p>
<p>You are advised to closely read the evaluation criteria set forth in this section prior to preparation of a technical proposal. If any documentation requested in this solicitation is not provided or is incomplete, the offeror will be disqualified from further participation in the procurement.</p>
<p>Award may be made without discussions. If discussions are conducted, they will occur at the time and place designated by the FBI. Following the completion of discussions, the Offeror shall submit a revised final proposal, as directed by the FBI. The revised final proposal shall reflect the Offeror's final proposal revisions regarding technical and price.</p>
<p>2. EVALUATION PROCEDURES:</p>
<p>All proposals will be reviewed to determine compliance with the requirements identified in the Description/Specification/Work Statement. If requested by the FBI, the contractor must be prepared to submit an example of a personal workmanship weapon.</p>
<p>The FBI reserves the right to set a Competitive Range consisting of the number of offerors that will proceed, COMPETITIVE RANGE SHALL BE: FIVE OFFERORS.</p>
<p>3. SOURCE EVALUATION AND SELECTION PROCEDURES - NEGOTIATED PROCUREMENTS:</p>
<p>A. EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD<br />Source selection will be based on the technical evaluation of the vendor's submissions, past performance history and cost/price. The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance:<br /><br />Technical Evaluation<br />Past Performance<br />Cost/Price</p>
<p>In addition, the sub-factors and criteria listed under each Evaluation Factor are also in descending of importance, unless stated otherwise. The offeror's proposal will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>The Source Evaluation Panel (SEP) will use a pass/fail &amp; quantitative rating system for the Technical and Past Performance evaluation process. The color-coded rating system is identified below.</p>
<p>EVALUATION STANDARD</p>
<p>Blue Exceeded the requirements of the RFQ. Consistently high quality performance can be expected.<br />Green Meets the requirements of the RFQ. High quality performance is likely but not assured due to minor omissions or areas where an unevenness might impact performance.<br />Brown Meets the requirements of the RFQ. Satisfactory performance is like, but not assured due to omissions, defects, or deficiencies.<br />Orange Meets the requirements of the RFQ. Moderate deficiencies exists which reflect the potential for poor, marginal effective performance.<br />Red Does not meet the requirements of the RFQ. Serious deficiencies exist in significant areas. Performance demonstrates inability to provide satisfactory service.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTOR #1 TECHNICAL:</p>
<p>Sub-Factor #1: Prior Qualifying Experience. Qualifying experience must be demonstrated in accordance with Description/Specification/Work Statement as follows:</p>
<p>&#61482; United States citizen;<br />&#61482; Possess a valid driver's license for the state of residence;<br />&#61482; Capable of being awarded a TOP SECRET security clearance by the Federal Government. (Reference the Security Section within Clause 52.212-4, Addendum.);<br />&#61482; Demonstrate substantial knowledge of firearms repair and maintenance procedures for weapons identified in Section 1, Introduction;<br />&#61482; Demonstrate ability of analyzing weapons in a non-working function;<br />&#61482; Certification as a gunsmith or armorer;<br />&#61482; Demonstrate through knowledge of FBI issued firearms including, but not be limited to, the Glock family of pistols, the SIG Sauer family of pistols, the Remington 870 shotgun, and the Colt pattern rifle/carbine. Such knowledge must include operating controls, disassembly and assembly, safety systems, and safe handling methods; and,<br />&#61482; Ability to use computers, including the preparation of documents and data input. Knowledge of Corel WordPerfect and Microsoft Office is preferred, but not required.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor #2 - FBI Weapon Disassembly Evaluation</p>
<p>Offerors will be required to disassemble and assemble common FBI service weapons, including the Glock 22 pistol, the Remington Model 870 shotgun, and the Colt pattern carbine. Correct techniques and safe weapon handling skills are required. Offerors will be provided an initial briefing which describes the level to which each weapon is to be disassembled, and the time frame in which the task is to be completed.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor #3 - Weapon Failure Analysis</p>
<p>Offerors will be presented with a Glock 22 pistol, a Remington Model 870 shotgun, and a Colt pattern carbine, with known problems. Each offeror will be given the same basic information about the failure, as written on a repair tag. The offeror will be required to identify the problem, through examining and disassembling the weapon.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor #4: Audiometer, Lead and Zinc Testing Results. All offerors shall provide documentation of their Audiometer, Lead and Zinc testing. There is an established criteria for the audiometer test stated in the Description/Specification/Work Statement. The lead level must be below 25 mg/dl. The zinc protoporphyrin must be below 50 mg/dl to be acceptable. Only those offerors who pass these tests will be evaluation further.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor #5 - Technical Question and Answer Presentation</p>
<p>Once an offeror is determined to be within the set competitive Range, the offeror must demonstrate their knowledge of firearms and firearms repair by responding to a series of standardized questions pertaining to the operation and repair of FBI weapon systems, including Glock pistols, Remington Model 870 shotguns, SIG Sauer pistols, Colt 1911 pattern pistols, and Colt pattern carbines.<br /><br />EVALUATION FACTOR #2 - PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The assessment for Past Performance shall be based on the following levels:</p>
<p>Neutral: No relevant past performance for evaluation. The offeror has asserted it has no relevant experience directly related to the work to be done under this solicitation. The offeror receives no merit or demerit for this factor.</p>
<p>Satisfactory: The offeror's experience/past performance on recent projects of the nature, size, and scope of the FBI requirement is sufficient to support the requirements of the statement of work and initial tasks. The experience/past performance information presented indicates the offeror will be capable of fulfilling the requirements of the SOW and initial task.</p>
<p>Marginal: The offeror's experience/past performance is extremely weak and shows little evidence that the contractor could perform on this proposed contract. The offeror may not have any experience or evidence of past performance. The proposal reflects a lack of understanding of the requirements and embodies unacceptable risks.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTOR #3 - COST/PRICE:</p>
<p>The price submitted by each offeror will be evaluated to determine the best value for the Government. The evaluated price shall be the cumulative total of the prices for the estimated quantities, base year and all option periods. The price evaluation will determine whether each Offeror's proposed prices are realistic, complete, and reasonable.</p>
<p>UNREALISTIC PROPOSALS</p>
<p>Offeror's are placed on notice that any proposals which are unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or are unreasonably low or high in price may be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the contract requirements and may be grounds for the rejection of the proposal.</p>
<p>4. OPTIONS</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate offerors for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.</p>
<p>5. AWARD</p>
<p>A written notice of award of acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ)] for: Etching of SiC Textile Ceramic Matrix Composite BackgroundThere is growing need to integrate sensors into the materials that are used to line theinner sections of aero-engine (rotary and jet) compressors and combustion chambers.  Thisis for the purpose of close proximity real time sensing of aero- and thermo-dynamicphenomena that is occurring within that environment. By sensing in real time thesechanges (e.g., pressure and temperature perturbations) it would become possible to usesuch information to improve engine performance, increase safety, and reduce the level ofundesirable combustion by-products.  The use of silicon carbide textile ceramic matrixcomposite as part of the engine liner component poses a challenge for sensor integrationby way of embedding.  This is because the microfabrication process for this material isnot fully developed. There needs to develop the batch microfabrication process technologythat would then allow the embedding of array of sensors into cavities that are etched inthe SiC composite material.  Initial attempts have been relatively successful.	However,more work needs to be done in the area of batch microfabrication using, preferably, theplasma reactive ion etching process.STATEMENT OF WORK AND SPECIFICATIONS:A minimum of three (3) substrate samples of SiC textile ceramic matrix composite havingdifferent patterns of electroplated nickel on them would be delivered to the vendor.The vendor:	Shall etch by reactive ion plasma not less than 150 microns into the SiC TextileCeramic Matrix;	Shall ensure that the etched bottom surface is within a roughness of +/- 10microns (RMS);	Shall ensure that the edge wall angle be no more than 10 degrees outward. 	Shall ensure that delivery of first etched substrate sample out of the three beno later than one month of receipt of substrate sample(s).The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 2005-31.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following two questions have been received from potential bidders.<br />Please respond as soon as possible to me so that I can respond in the<br />form of an amendment to the solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong>&nbsp; In reviewing the above noted solicitation I have discovered discrepancies and / or conflicts in the requirements for this project.&nbsp; Please provide clarification of which item should take precedence and provide the basis for our bid.</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; B.2 Supplies Prices and Costs <br />This matrix requests&nbsp; <br />CLIN 0001 "Solid floor panels, Tate ConCore 2500 access floor panel with 1/16 ST61 IT ..."&nbsp; The panel named has a concentrated load rating of 2500 pounds.</p>
<p>2) C.2.4 Concentrated Load Strength <br />This paragraph states "A&nbsp; concentrated load of 1500 pounds..."&nbsp; This is in direct conflict with the concentrated load listed above.</p>
<p>The uniform, rolling and impact loads in section C are consistent with a ConCore 2500 panel.&nbsp; It appears that the Concentrated load listed in C.2.4 may be a typographic error, but I would appreciate written confirmation prior to submitting a firm price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Answer to&nbsp;Question 1:</strong> C.2.4 contains a typographical error. It should read "A concentrated load of 2500 pounds..."</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> I have reviewed the above solicitation and believe that you may be replacing exisiting raised floor panels. If that is the case, please consider our On-Site re-surfacing service as a "Green" and fiscally more responsible approach. Each panel we are able to return to service reduces energy use by the btu equivalent of 2.6 bbls of oil, generates @ .86 manhours for local labor and saves up to 80% of the cost of purchasing and installing a new raised floor panel.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Answer to Question 2:</strong> No. There are (3) problems we have with pursuing this option. The first is that the existing tiles are 40 years old and have<br />wooden core and will not meet the concentrated load requirements of<br />today's high-density applications. The second is that we have a zinc<br />whisker problem with the existing tiles that can only be resolved by<br />replacing them. The final problem is that the structural grid<br />underneath the tiles is rusted through and will also be replaced. There<br />is no guarantee that the old tiles will fit properly onto the new grid<br />structure.</p>

<DESC>**AMENDMENT**

The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions that were submitted regarding the posting above.


Question # 1- 

In the Statement of Work, in section 2.1-Mandatory and desirable features. Please explain more on email in and email out items. I would like to know if you want the system has a email server component, or the system integrate with exist email server, if it is the later scenario, could you please let me know what is the existing email server (exchange server or others)? I believe that these information is critical for us to propose our solutions.

Answer to questions # 1-

The FDA is not specifying how to address this requirement (to be able to send email to and from collaborative workspaces), but has utilized both scenarios described in the question.  FDA currently uses Microsoft Exchange. 



Question # 2-

The proposal states that “CDRH is piloting collaboration software that will enhance our ability to share information readily with one another.”  What is that pilot software, and will that provider be bidding on this contract?

Answer to question # 2-

Traction Teampage is the pilot software. It is a business decision on behalf of that company, as to whether or not they will be bidding.

<DESC>This solicitation is for 100% small business set-aside.

This solicitation has been extended through June 12, 2009 and will close at 5:00pm Eastern Standard Time.

Please thoroughly review solicitation before e-mailing for any question.



           Question in regards to the solicitation mentioned above. 

1.	On your solicitation you estimate a total average of about 54,000 pgs for the year on Grand Jury hearing, my questions is if that estimate is only of one specific court location or is that for all district hearing which are about 780 per year in which that number is also included in the solicitation? 

All district hearings.

2.	Estimated were only 64,000 pgs for deposition when you have over 1,500 depositions   scheduled on average is that correct as well?

                Yes

The reason why questions were asked is because they seem to be low for the amount of hearing and depositions given for the estimated pages given as well.   

3.	For these hearing It was read that there will be some type of security background check on which every employee are to attend the hearings and depositions, what would be the security clearance requirement for such hearing and depositions if any? Also will the fingerprint cards need to be sent in with the proposal for the bid or will that happen after when and if we are awarded the bid?  
                PLEASE READ THE SOLICITATION SECTION H.

4. 	Last question is, are the solicitation provisions included in the notice required to be included in the proposal our company will submit, specifically section E.3 52.212-3?   
                        
No

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Information Management Services (CIMS) Solicitation</p>
<p>Background: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), is planning to award contract(s) for CDC information management services (CIMS) as a follow-on to a series of similar IT service contracts that have been in place since the mid 1980's. CDC plans to issue the request for proposals (RFP) for this contract in the summer 2009, with contract award anticipated for mid 2010.</p>
<p>A Request for Information (RFI) was published on FedBizOpps and was open from February 27 through April 18, 2008 and resulted in 36 industry responses. A Request for Industry Comment (RFIC) was then published on the FedBizOpps website and was open from February 5, 2009 through February 27, 2009 resulting in 40 industry responses. Both sets of industry responses have been very helpful in CDC's effort on formulating this next generation contract.</p>
<p>This notice announces the availability of the draft RFP for CIMS which is not a complete RFP, e.g. does not include all the terms, conditions, and contract clauses, but does provide the essence of the statement of work, cost and pricing structure, and evaluation criteria. Please be advised that this draft may change based on further industry feedback and continued CDC refinements.</p>

<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information.  This announcement IS NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) of any kind.  Further, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
All interested parties are advised that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI).  Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey/Request for Information submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense.
Previous market surveys have solicited responses pertaining to specific switch technologies and applications.  The FAA is now pursuing an end-to-end system approach to upgrade the aging National Airspace System (NAS) voice communications infrastructure in order to satisfy NextGen initiatives that require a networked infrastructure to support dynamic asset reallocation.  The NAS voice communications system consists of voice switching functions, radio control functions, and a telecommunications medium.
The upgrade will require a system with proven technology that ensures availability in both high traffic volume and emergency situations while maintaining current voice quality and latency standards.  The purpose of this Market Survey/RFI is:  to solicit information related to improving the Government's understanding of the current voice communications marketplace, to obtain information on available technology and innovative approaches that may fulfill its mission, and to gain insight into industry capabilities and best practices in regards to a voice system that provides flexibility for the NAS.  Vendors are welcome to invite the FAA to view demonstrations of any aspect of their representative solutions.  The FAA is contemplating a Contract Award date in FY11.
Attachment A provides background information on the current NAS voice communications system, concepts and ideas being studied by our European counterparts as well standards development by International bodies in support of Air Traffic Management communications to help gain insight into issues impacting its performance and long term supportability.  
Attachment B is the vendor response template.  Interested vendors are requested to provide full and complete responses to the items in Attachment B.  Special emphasis is being placed on identifying innovative communications solutions that will improve the quality of the FAA's Investment Analysis efforts and the forthcoming acquisition of a new state of the art voice communications system.
Respondents to the Market Survey/Request for Information may be requested to provide additional information at the option of the Government. No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise for future business with the FAA.  Information obtained from Attachment B will be used to support the development of an acquisition strategy for a national program supporting all NAS voice communications; to refine the Government's NVS business case; and resolve system issues to support a business decision. Respondents who have additional material to add to previous inquiries are invited to provide supplemental responses.  
All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 50 pages.  No type font less than 12-point may be used.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  If there are questions, please submit them to the FAA Contracting Office, Ken Carter, via e-mail at Kenneth.M.Carter@faa.gov and via telephone at 202-267-3012.  Responses to this RFI must be submitted by 3:00 p.m. on July 10 2009 but are welcome before the due date as well.
The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following email address: Kenneth.M.Carter@faa.gov.  Please submit in a portable document format (PDF), however, Microsoft Word is acceptable.  If you cannot respond electronically, please send to:
Federal Aviation AdministrationATTN: Mr. Ken Carter, AJA-47800 Independence Avenue, SWWashington, D.C. 20591



ATTACHMENT ADESCRIPTION OF MISSION NEED  

There is an increasing need for flexible voice communication capabilities in support of both current and future demands on the FAA's NAS.  New capabilities must overcome the inflexibility of current NAS voice communications by allowing better access to voice communication assets, load-sharing and load balancing across facilities, and dynamicallyreconfiguring sectors/facilities to support Air Traffic Management (ATM) and Business Continuity Planning.  The future of the NAS requires the migration toward a networked voice communications system.
The NAS voice communications system consists of voice switching functions, radio control functions and a telecommunications medium that supports Air Traffic Control (ATC) facilities with as few as 4 positions to over 800 positions.  The scope of such a system creates several technical challenges.  To meet mission requirements, the FAA must field a voice system with proven technology that ensures availability in both high traffic volume and emergency situations, while maintaining or improving current voice quality levels and latency standards.  
The following documents are included in this RFI as reference:
- NextGen CONOPS (see http://www.jpdo.gov/library/NextGen_v2.0.pdf )- Presentation on European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment (EUROCAE) Working Group (WG) 67 EUROCAE Documents (EDs) 136-139.- NAS Voice Communications Proposed Functional Architecture and Definitions- Previous Market Survey Solicitations are available upon request
The following may be used for a more complete understanding of current NAS planning:NAS Architecture 6.0 - http://nas-architecture.faa.gov/nas/NextGen - http://www.jpdo.gov/	      
ATTACHMENT BMARKET SURVEY/REQUEST FOR INFORMATIONRESPONSE TEMPLATE

Respondents are requested to provide a white paper response identifying innovative approaches to the voice communications requirements in Attachment A.   The response must:
1.	Include an Executive Summary (no more than one page).
2.   Provide analyses and information in response to the following:

<p><strong>This is a request for information.</strong></p>
<p>Please address the following questions: &nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;<br />1. FEMA has in the past in most cases used tents for housing First Responders when they had to construct the camp in open spaces. Are you aware of any other options versus building a "tent city"?</p>
<p>2. FEMA needs the ability to reduce or increase the size of the camp in a short timeframe. Based on that what is the best method of cost migration? Is there a way to execute reductions or increases more cost effectively and time efficiently?</p>
<p>3. FEMA has a requirement to provide turn key housing for First Responders for a minimum of 301 and a maximum of 2000 occupants. Would you recommend phasing or modular installation?</p>
<p>4. What is the shortest period of time in which subcontracting for equipment and personnel needed to support the camp (maintenance) can be conducted?</p>
<p>5. Based on the still pending requirement that all personnel must be cleared at a minimum, fingerprinting and credit check, will this affect the time to erect a camp and turn it over for occupancy by FEMA authorized personnel? The current time is 72 hours.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of amendment # 2 is to delete SECTION C.1.7 SUBCONTRACTS and to post questions and answers pertaining to this solicitation.  The following section is hereby deleted from the solicitation:

C.1.7	SUBCONTRACTS
No subcontracts are anticipated for this contract.  However, any subcontract would require prior written permission of the NRC Contracting Officer.

The following questions and answers pertain to this solicitation:

1) In reference to C.1.3, Contract Objective, the objectives are broad. What is the level of detail expected? Will this ABWR Technology Training Manual be used to conduct a 2 week, 6 week, etc. course?

The second paragraph is specific to the level of detail required (see bullets i. through ix.).  The material will be used by the NRC for training courses of varying lengths.

2) The solicitation does not address writing Objectives for the training manual.  Is this something that the NRC would prefer to be included in the manual? 

The objectives for the various training courses, which this manual will be the text for, will be developed by the NRC.

3) Is it an option to request additional time for development? 

The NRC expects that the bulk of the material has already been developed and will only need to be adjusted as the NRC style manual. See C.1.4 Performance Work Statement.

4) More information on the level of detail or more specific objectives in these areas would be helpful.

The NRC expects that the PRA and Design Basis information used to develop the Design Certification Package and proposed FSAR will be sufficient.

<DESC>Department of State 2009 Construction Services for U.S. Embassy Rome Italy

Notice of Solicitation of Submissions for Contractor Pre-Qualification

This announcement hereby cancels the announcement posted previously under this SAQMMA09R0074 on April 3, 2009.

Any offerors that wish to be considered will need to submit a new proposal in accordance with the announcement below. Previously submitted offers will not be considered. 

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS), Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is requesting submissions to pre-qualify firms for construction services for the partial renovation and upgrade of the existing facilities at the U. S. Embassy in Rome, Italy.  The renovation will include the Marine Security Guard Quarters (MSGQ) and the multi-purpose room located on the Embassy Rome compound in the Sembler building.  This construction project will complete the MSGQ construction and the multi-purpose room improvements.

The original U.S. government-owned, 4-acre and buildings were acquired by the Department in 1946.  Portions of the 12,700 gsm chancery were constructed in the 1600s.  The twin consular and public diplomacy buildings each contain 2,500 gsm of floor space.  An additional parcel and office space were acquired and added to the compound in FY 2003.  The building was designed in 1927 for the INA Insurance Company and was occupied by the company until the sale.  Its 2 ½ acre trapezoidal site forms a natural corner to our embassy compound and brings the total compound size to 6.5 acres.

Project Description:  
Security Clearance is NOT Required

SAQMMA-09-R0074 Rome, Italy– Complete the MSGQ construction and the multi-purpose room improvements.  Estimated construction cost is $2 to $5 million. 

Acquisition Phase I – Pre-Qualification of Offerors
This announcement of solicitation of pre-qualification submissions is Phase I.  DOS will evaluate and rate the pre-qualification submissions based on the procedure and evaluation criteria set forth below.  DOS may refuse to pre-qualify any Offeror receiving less than a satisfactory rating on any evaluation factor or sub-factor.

Acquisition Phase II – Requests for Proposals from Pre-Qualified Offerors
Those Offerors determined to be pre-qualified in accordance with this notice will be issued a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) for the project and invited to submit proposed pricing in Phase II.  The RFP will include a statement of work, final design documents and outline specifications that set out the project scope, construction process, post-construction activities; unique site constraints and requirements for maintaining security and operations during construction.

Whistleblower Protections Under The American Recovery And Reinvestment Act of 2009 
(Mar 2009) 

(a) The Contractor shall post notice of employees rights and remedies for whistleblower protections provided under section 1553 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5). 

(b) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause including this paragraph (b) in all subcontracts. 

(End of clause) 


52.204-11  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act—Reporting Requirements. 
As prescribed in 4.1502, insert the following clause: 

American Recovery and Reinvestment Act—Reporting Requirements (Mar 2009) 

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause— 

“Contract”, as defined in FAR 2.101, means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see FAR Part 16. 

“First-tier subcontract” means a subcontract awarded directly by a Federal Government prime contractor whose contract is funded by the Recovery Act. 

“Jobs created” means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as “full-time equivalent” (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. 

“Jobs retained” means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as “full-time equivalent” (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. 

“Total compensation” means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the contractor’s past fiscal year of the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)): 

(1) Salary and bonus. 

(2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. Use the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Shared Based Payments. 

(3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans. Does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees. 

(4) Change in pension value. This is the change in present value of defined benefit and actuarial pension plans. 

(5) Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified. 

(6) Other compensation. For example, severance, termination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or property if the value for the executive exceeds $10,000. 

(b) This contract requires the contractor to provide products and/or services that are funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Act funds under this contract. These reports will be made available to the public. 

(c) Reports from contractors for all work funded, in whole or in part, by the Recovery Act, and for which an invoice is submitted prior to June 30, 2009, are due no later than July 10, 2009. Thereafter, reports shall be submitted no later than the 10th day after the end of each calendar quarter. 

(d) The Contractor shall report the following information, using the online reporting tool available at   www.FederalReporting.gov. 

(1) The Government contract and order number, as applicable. 

(2) The amount of Recovery Act funds invoiced by the contractor for the reporting period. A cumulative amount from all the reports submitted for this action will be maintained by the government’s on-line reporting tool. 

(3) A list of all significant services performed or supplies delivered, including construction, for which the contractor invoiced in this calendar quarter. 

(4) Program or project title, if any. 

(5) A description of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract, including significant deliverables and, if appropriate, associated units of measure. 

(6) An assessment of the contractor’s progress towards the completion of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract (i.e., not started, less than 50 percent completed, completed 50 percent or more, or fully completed). This covers the contract (or portion thereof) funded by the Recovery Act. 

(7) A narrative description of the employment impact of work funded by the Recovery Act. This narrative should be cumulative for each calendar quarter and only address the impact on the contractor’s workforce. At a minimum, the contractor shall provide— 

(i) A brief description of the types of jobs created and jobs retained in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). This description may rely on job titles, broader labor categories, or the contractor’s existing practice for describing jobs as long as the terms used are widely understood and describe the general nature of the work; and 

(ii) An estimate of the number of jobs created and jobs retained by the prime contractor, in the United States and outlying areas. A job cannot be reported as both created and retained. 

(8) Names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated officers of the Contractor for the calendar year in which the contract is awarded if— 

(i) In the Contractor’s preceding fiscal year, the Contractor received— 

(A) 80 percent or more of its annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and 

(B) $25,000,000 or more in annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies 15,055 useable square feet of office and related space in a building under lease in Washington, DC, that will expire on May 21, 2019.  The Government has a requirement for an additional 16,000 contiguous useable square feet of office and related space. The total rentable space must yield a minimum of 31,055 useable square feet.  It is acceptable to have two separate blocks of approximately 15,528 useable square feet of contiguous space in the same building. 

The delineated area is Washington, DC Central Business District, and the West End.

Other requirements applicable to this requirement include:

• Proximity to Metrorail/ Metro Bus
• Parking (# of on site, reserved spaces (inside vs. outside) for official Government
vehicles)
• Security (i.e. lobby, loading dock access, parking, etc.)

The Government is considering whether to expand at the existing location or to relocate to alternative space which can meet the entire space requirement.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s entire requirement for a ten year term, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, rent payments on vacant space under the existing lease and/or cost of buyout, etc.

<DESC><p>Document Type: Synopsis / Pre-solicitation Notice<br />Solicitation Number: W9126G-09-R-0101 (previously W9126G-09-R-0071)<br />Posted Date: April 30, 2009<br />Synopsis posted for: 15 days<br />Post solicitation no earlier than: May 15, 2009<br />Current Response Date: May 30, 2009<br />Classification Code: Y---Construction of Structures and Facilities<br />Set Aside: 8(a) Set Aside Pool of Contractors <br />NAICS Code: 236220 -Commercial &amp; Institutional Building Construction <br />Program Type: American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA)<br /><br />Contracting Office Address<br />US Army Engineer District, Fort Worth, ATTN: CESWT-CT (Karen Nelson), 819 Taylor Street Room 2A19, Fort Worth, TX 76102 <br /><br />Description <br />This is a special notice to inform the public of the use of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This Synopsis provides ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation will be forthcoming. All questions regarding this SYNOPSIS should be submitted in writing to the following E-Mail address: Karen.S.Nelson@usace.army.mil. <br /><br />This Acquisition shall be competed as an 8 (a) SET ASIDE. This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only. An 8 (a) Set Aside solicitation shall be issued for Design-Build Construction Services. Services include Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build, and Construction services to meet the requirements for the following customers: Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area. <br /><br />Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs), with a base period plus four one-year option periods, for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build, and construction services with an estimated total workload value of $140 million for SWF and SWD customers. <br /><br />Any work executed under the SWD MATOC is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico). However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area if capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. <br /><br />Scope of work includes, but is not limited to as follows: construction, renovation, repairs and alterations, preventive maintenance, environmental abatement, and operations activities. The contracts are not only intended to execute new construction, design-build and design-bid-build, but to provide a timely response to remediation of real and personal property facilities, e.g., maintenance, repair, asbestos and lead-base paint abatement, and minor construction situations relating to, but not limited to, civil, mechanical, plumbing, structural, electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), instrumentation, anti-terrorism and force protection. <br /><br />The Fort Worth District intends to award two or more contracts within the 8(a) Set Aside pool, with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $15 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3,000. The minimum guarantee for the 8(a) Set Aside contract is $3,000 and it only applies to the base period. <br /><br />In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the PDT will consider 1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement. <br /><br />Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors. However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the five contractor pools. All contracts will remain active unless or until 1) the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) contract expiration; 3) task order completion; 4) the contractual funding limit is reached; or 5) the contract is terminated for convenience or default by the Government. Separate solicitations will be issued for the different contractor pools (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB). <br /><br />Any entity may submit proposal(s) who qualifies for the Statement of Work in the Solicitation. The Awardees will make up the pool for each of the unrestricted and set-aside contract areas (HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business and unrestricted). There must be two or more awards to create each of the HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Small Business or unrestricted pool. If there are not enough offerors in any one of the pools to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by- 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be awarded. <br /><br />The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening. All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government. <br /><br />The basic contract award is anticipated to consider pricing associated with professional labor rates. These rates will not be subject to the Service Contract Act nor the Davis Bacon Act; General and Administrative rate; and Overhead rates. After award, competition among the individual pool of contractors for project specific task order requirements is expected to result in fair and reasonable pricing. However, the contractors pricing will primarily be associated with the quantity of professional labor based on the established contract unit price, competitive subcontractor pricing, and commercial items associated with a specific requirements. The contractors proposal for a task order will include all the costs for the projectlump sum. There will not be a line item cost for subcontractors or commercial items on the bid schedule. The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs. The price proposal shall also (as applicable) include cost for: All waste and excess material, Mobilization and close out for the total contract and each task order, Clean up, Safety (e.g., safety rails, safety nets, tethers, face/clothing protection, etc.), Traffic and work-site signs and barriers, Project management and supervision, Quality Control (QC), Office management and equipment, Depreciation of mobile office(s), Subcontractor profit, As-Built drawing, submittal, permits, license and other risks of doing business, and Site security. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542, a Classification Code of Y111, and a business size standard of $33.5 million. <br /><br />This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W912DS-09-B-0010. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) to award a contract for the Plattsburgh Harbor Breakwater Repairs project. The work involves placement of approximately 12,690 tons of Armor stone (4.5 9 tons each) and 9,210 tons of underlayer/bedding stone to raise the breakwater to its original design elevation. The breakwater is located approximately one-half mile offshore necessitating that the repair/placement work be performed using floating plant. All work must be completed by November 2009 due to adverse weather conditions in Lake Champlain.<br /><br />This procurement is being solicited as a 100% SMALL BUSINESS set-aside. The applicable NAICS Code is 237990. The Small Business size is $33,500,000. The SIC Code is 1629, Heavy Construction, Not Elsewhere Classified. The range of the estimated construction cost is $2,000,000.00 to $2,500,000.00. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires that Past Performance Information (PPI) be collected on Department of Defense (DoD) contracts. The Government has now implemented a web-enabled application that collects and manages contractor past performance data. Effective 1 April 2007, the system, Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), requires both the contractor and the Government to submit their portion of the CPARS report via the internet for Construction contracts in excess of $100,000.00. More definitive guidance and instructions will be incorporated in the solicitation and resultant contract. In the meantime, to become familiar with the system, the CPARS website has a computer-based training module and a practice session for your use at https://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/ct/I/home.asp by following the links to the Training. Plans and Specifications for the subject project will be available on or about 27 MAY 2009 with bid opening on or about 29 JUNE 2009. Bids are to be submitted to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Contracting Division, Room 1843, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, NY 10278. The media selected for issuance of Synopsis/Solicitation and amendments shall solely be at the discretion of the Government; accordingly, the media utilized for this project shall be the Internet. TELEPHONE, E-MAIL, OR FAX REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR HONORED. Paper copies of this solicitation and amendment, if any, will not be available or issued. Interested parties may download and print the solicitation at no charge from the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website, http://www.fbo.gov. All vendors who want access to the solicitation will be required to register with Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov) and FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). The system called Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fbo.gov) has been upgraded as a web-based dissemination tool designed to safeguard acquisition-related information for all federal agencies. Business opportunities can be located in Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fbo.gov) or the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) acquisition business website (https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi). To keep informed of changes, check http://www.fbo.gov frequently. Some contractor tools are as follows: 1. Register to receive Notification, and 2. Subscribe to the Mailing List for specific solicitation at FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov) or utilize the Vendor Notification Service in ASFI (https://www.acquisition.army.mil/asfi). A hyperlink posted in FedBizOpps will direct vendors to Federal Business Opportunities to download solicitations, plans, specifications, and amendments. Project specification files and drawings are portable document files (PDF) and can be viewed, navigated, printed using A5. Internet Explorer 6.0 is the recommended browser. However, Internet Explorer 4.x, Internet Explorer 5.5 or greater, Netscape 4.x (except 4.7) and Netscape 5.x are also compatible with the Federal Business Opportunities website.

Box), and telephone and facsimile numbers (including area codes). Make checks or money orders payable in the amount of $15.00 to USACE, NY.

As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source due to a unique capability provided, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1).

Phase I is for the troubleshooting of a condensation issue experienced in the Turret Sensor Unit (TSU) in the Q2 system. Redesign and testing of the fix will be accomplished in the TSU under Phase I.
