<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for exhibition rental space and registration fees at the AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting in Reno, NV for a NASA Langley exhibit from January 6-9, 2003. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from the American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) as the only known source that can meet the Agency's needs. The 41st Annual AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting, scheduled for January 6 to 9, 2003 in Reno, NV, is a forum for high-level program managers, engineers, scientists, and educators from the aviation industry to discuss advances in aviation design, manufacturing, and operations. This event provides a unique opportunity to educate the aviation community about our aerospace programs and research activites, build new industry partnerships and alliances, and provides an ideal forum for scientists and engineers from industry, government, and academia to share and disseminate scientific knowledge and results.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 16, 2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This is not a Request for Proposals.  This is the VA Austin Automation Center (AAC)'s notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract for CONNECT:Direct OS390 with Sterling Commerce.  The AAC currently has CONNECT:Direct MVS.  Since Sterling Commerce is no longer providing software maintenance services for the MVS version of CONNECT:Direct, the AAC must migrate to the OS390 version of CONNECT:Direct. The migration to the OS390 version requires a new license and no other source is available to provide CONNECT:Direct OS390, hence a new contract for the license and new version of the software. The procurement is being conducted using FAR Part 12 procedures, and award is targeted for December 17, 2002.

<DESC>NA david.potter@mail1.Monmouth.army.mil, francis.orzech@mail1.monmouth.army.mil.  This is a Request for Information. The Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) is gathering information regarding developed and emerging technologies having the potential for application to Army missions conducted in Urban environments.  I2WD has initiated a new Science and Technology Objective (STO) program in FY03 titled Information Operations for the Objective Force (IOOF).  The IOOF STO will have a duration of  four (4) years and will be focused on maturing sensor technology, signal processing techniques, and Computer Network Operations (CNO) and Information Operations (IO) techniques for transition to the Army’s Future Combat Systems (FCS) and other Army progra ms.  Products from the IOOF STO will be tested and evaluated with the I2WD lab facilities and in I2WD run field tests.  The information requested below will be used by I2WD in requirements analysis, planning and developing a technical architecture, and in assessing the technology readiness for the potential development of a future system by a Materiel Developer and industry. Background: The goal of the IOOF STO is to provide a Unit of Action with a capability to locate (in 3-dimensional space) and identify threat hostile Command and Control nodes located in an Urban setting; this includes being able to differentiate between threat Command and Control nodes and commercially operated telecommunications centers; it also includes an ability to locate the host of  a logical address in a given physical area (given the logical addresses in a known physical area).  I2WD believes that collection and exploitation using a number of technologies against the electronic systems that one would expect to see in an Urban C2 lo cation will be required to reliably locate the target.  The operational range for this capability will be no greater than 2000 meters, and the technologies must be capable of operating against commercially available communications equipment that emit RF si gnals during normal operations (e.g., PCS technologies, wireless LAN technologies, paging systems) and against systems that are emitting radiation allowable by part 15 of the FCC rules and other similar international standards; this capability can be enabl ed by separate receiver systems, but they must be able to be integrated with each other to provide a complete mapping of the RF environment relevant to a Tactical C2 node.   In addition, the technology must be capable of operating in conditions that would normally be expected in a typical Urban environment, one characterized by a high signal density (a large number of intentional and unintentional RF sources in a given area), high levels of multipath from buildings, and potentially co channel interferences from those sources.  I2WD is also interested in incorporating a conventional and/or unconventional CNO capability as a part of the program.  I2WD intends to integrate these capabilities into a system that is easily transportable by a single individual, rec ognizing that a number of networked systems may be required to obtain a target location suitable for deploying forces in an urban setting.  The IOOF STO intent is to integrate technology from existing 6.2/6.3 programs and commercially available technology required for successful transition to FCS and Army programs in the FY05-06 timeframe.  Successful transition is defined as a capability at Technology Readiness Level 6.  TRL 6 is defined as sensor systems, signal processing algorithms, and CNO algorithms t hat have been successfully field tested in a relevant environment on functional prototype hardware.  TRL 6 products of the IOOF STO should demonstrate sufficient risk reduction for transition to 6.4-funded productization efforts conducted by PM FCS, other Army PMs, and other users. I2WD seeks responses about the following major Components: 1. Existing High sensitivity receiver systems operating in the frequency range between 20MHz-18GHz, particularly those capable of detecting, discriminating, and identifying the operating protocols or information that may be associated with unintentional sources of RF radiation, at distances of at least 250 meters, and growing t o a range of 2000 meters;  2. Software algorithms that will take as input data from the high sensitivity receiver and allow the discrimination and/or geolocation of individual sources of RF radiation in a high density RF environment; 3. Protocol recognitio n technologies capable of working with the input from the high sensitivity receiver and identifying the underlying operational protocol 95% of the time or better;  4. Traffic analysis algorithms that will look at all available received signal data, and pro cess that data, using conventional traffic analysis, to further identify potential targets of interest.  Technical subjects: 1. High Sensitivity receiver technology; 2. Co-channel processing for intercept and location; 3. Complex modulations, i.e. digital, spread spectrum, LPI;  4. Commercially available telecommunications intercept and identification capabil ity, involving sophisticated waveforms, burst, wide-band, LPI;  5. Precision Geo-location using antenna technology capable of providing 3-dimensional vectors; 6. GPS technology; 7. Data filtering to reduce load on the communications link between sensor sys tems; 8. Sensor correlation and cross-cue; 9. Moving emitter tracking; 10. Use of Urban terrain and sensor geometry data and Urban Mapping; 11. Size, mobility, sustainability, self-deployability; 12. Size, weight, and power compatibility with FCS mini robo tic vehicle,UAV, and manpack  concepts; 13. Multipath signal analysis.  Table  I  lists typical threshold and objective technical capabilities for the IOOF sensor systems and may be used as a guide in answering this RFI.  Responses can be of any format. Su pplemental materials, such as brochures, white papers, briefings, spec sheets, etc., are welcome, as long as they accompany a response. Actual lab and field test results submitted are encouraged and desired.  When preparing your responses, be specific, and  make sure you answer the following questions. What capability, by name, fits this desired capability, falls under what component(s) and area(s), and what technical subject(s) does it address? How? What are it’s technical specifications? Describe the capab ility in detail. What is the status of the technology? Use of standard TRL Levels is encouraged in the interest of providing a common terminology. Is it available now? If not, when will it be available, and with what degree of effort is involved (i.e., min iaturization, additional cooling, lower power requirements, etc)? How extensive is the test data obtained with the devices? Does your organization wish to point out any special considerations that I2WD should know about developing the system described that  is not included in the components, areas, or technical subjects listed above? All sources involved with any subjects discussed above are invited to respond. This RFI does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government to purchase systems or ser vices. The Government will not award a contract based on this RFI. The Government will not pay for the information received in response to this RFI.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to with Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc., 6611 Dumbarton Circle, Fremont, CA 94555 for the acquisition of a SELDI ProteinChip Technology System. Requirement: (1) The system shall perform surface-enhanced affinity capture(SEAC) using surface-enhanced laser description/ionization (SELDI) for the quantitative analysis of trace components (at low femtomole levels) directly from biological samples. (2) The system shall perform analyses  of protein chips comprising arrays of antibodies to capute diagnostic marker proteins directly from biological specimens for identification based on molecular mass. (3) The system shall perform the analysis of one microliter of unfractionated biological fluid as well as extract to provide a protein  retentate map with a minimum  of 300 features (peaks). (4)  The system shall purify proteins from complex biological mixtures directly on the protein chip surface. (5) The system shall perform on-chip molecular processing, including protein purification, peptide mapping, C-terminal, microsequencing  and post-translational modification analysis. (6)The system shall provided automated peak integration (digitization) with peak map display and comparison formats for differential protein display. (9) The system shall perform analyses of protein chip molecular arrays in a fully automated mode  requiring a minimum of 1000 addressable regions per 2 mm of surface area. (10) The contractor shall provided a one year warranty for each hardware, software, and firmware product delivered. (11) All equipment will be installed on site and familiarization training provided within 60 days of  purchase. The unique aspect of the system is its ability to capture important biomolecules (proteins and peptides) directly from the biological sample (such as serum) applied to a chip, wash away contaminants, desorb analytes from the chip and simultaneously analyze for >100 proteins in the sample.  This enables one to rapidly identify and screen for biomarkers of effects by comparison of protein "fingerprints" of normal tp "diseased" animals. No other technology is known to have these combined capabilities. EPA believes Ciphergen Biosystem, Inc., is the only vendor capable of satisfying  requirements stated above. The circumstance permitting "other than full and open competition" is FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements".  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no  solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provided the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification  statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication. Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Pamela E. Smith (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. No telephonic or faxed request will be honored.

Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this posting is to release one GAO protest decision impacting this RFP.  The decision resolves the protest numbered B-290751.8 (on the GAO electronic protest docket this is B-290751.008).  The decision is available here in association with this notice, and this serves as the official notice to offerors regarding this decision.  You will have to link over to the accompanying .pdf file to access this decision (the system requires me to upload the file separate from this message.) No response to this posting is required from offerors.

No new offers are being solicited as a result of this update (there have been many calls from firms that were not offerors after each update here on fedbizopps and I welcome inquiries, but only offers received prior to the initial deadline of 3/12/2002 are under evaluation for initial awards.)  

There have been many offerors that have called desiring a firm date by which we will make awards. At this time, and as a result of this lastest protest at GAO being denied (as have all the others), the agency/GSA is now able to continue evaluations (the CICA stay is lifted.)  Although I can not state a date certain by which awards will be announced, we are getting closer to doing so.

I don't yet anticipate requesting another extension of time, but I highly recommend each remaining offeror to be cognizant that it is possible.

Thank you all for your patience as we forge ahead.

Matt

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the
purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application. The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or  call DLSC at the above number. The solicitation/data package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued. Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).  

Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.


Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified above for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition. If your concerns are not satisfied by the contacting officer, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Kathy Cames, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 912-926-2604. Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application. The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or call DLSC at the above number. The solicitation/data package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued. Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).  

Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.


Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified above for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition. If your concerns are not satisfied by the contacting officer, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Kathy Cames, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 912-926-2604. Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research related to basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines and novel therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and improvements in public health.  As a part of the research program to improve defense against bioterrorism and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases, the NIAID seeks to establish an Administrative Center in support of the NIAID Proteomics Research Program, being solicited under a separate RFP (see RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-38).  The Proteomics Research Program shall focus on early stage basic research for target discovery and identification and early validation studies.  The subject solicitation is being issued as a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  See Government-wide Numbered Note 1.  As assistance to the Proteomics Research Program, the Administrative Center will: 1) Design, develop, and maintain a publicly accessible website that contains the data and technology protocols generated by each Proteomics Research site, as well as a catalog of reagents and products developed by the sites and available for public distribution; 2) Monitor and facilitate the deposition of reagents and protein targets generated by the Proteomics Research sites.  It is anticipated that the Proteomics sites will deposit their reagents/products to a centralized repository such as the Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research Resource, a new program that will be supported by a separate NIAID contract for distribution to the broader research community; 3) In conjunction with the Project Officer, establish a Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) composed of leading scientists knowledgeable in a broad range of proteomics and bioinformatic research areas.  The committee members shall also include individuals with expertise in microbiology, immunology (both innate and adaptive immunity), and infectious diseases.  The committee shall provide advice to the NIAID on the operations and future directions of the Proteomics Centers program based on the state of proteomic technological and research advances, including those contributed by the Proteomics Centers; and 4) Organize programmatic meetings and other related activities involving all of the Proteomics Research Program sites.  It is anticipated that one (1) cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded, with a period of five (5) years, beginning approximately September 2003.  RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-45 will be available electronically on or about December 12, 2002, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>58--Lightweight Video Reconnaissance System (LVRS)
<SOLNBR>DAAB07-03-R-J018
<RESPDATE>122702
<ARCHDATE>02252003
<CONTACT>Kathleen Hageman, 732-532-5388
<DESC>NA This is a market survey to locate sources (System Integrators) for the Lightweight Video Reconnaissance System (LVRS).  The LVRS is used by United States Special Forces reconnaissance/scout squads to capture digital still pictures, compress, and transmit n ear real-time, still frame images to base stations or battalion tactical operations centers (TOCs) over standard military radios.  The system is comprised of a base station and multiple outstations.  The outstation consists of a day camera to capture the i mages, an Image Intensification (I²) attachment for use during periods of extremely low light (10-4 Foot Candles), as well as a computer to compress the image, add desired text or symbols, display the image, and interface with squad or team organic radios.   The base station consists of a computer to interface with the TOC base station radios and a printer to print the images.  Further, the LVRS base station can retransmit images to other base stations. The LVRS shall be MIL-STD-2500B with Notice 1, National Imagery Transmission Format Version 2.1 (NITF 2.1) Certified (minimum Level 3).  The LVRS shall be Joint Technical Architecture - Army (JTA-A), Version 6.0 compliant.  LVRS shall provide a full range of data transmission capabilities, communication links (e.g. SINCGARS, PSC-5 (Narrow Band, Wide Band, and DAMA), AN/PRC-148, AN/PRC-150, other HF and SATCOM).  Imagery and Data shall be able to be sent over all government voice bandwidth circuits in harsh tactical environments where airtime for transmissions is limited and using cryptographic devices (e.g. KY-57, KY-58, KY-99, KY-99A, KG-84A, KG-84C, KIV-7, and KY-100) or secure telephones (STU-III, STE).  The LVRS shall be compliant with; MIL-STD-188-184, Interoperability and Performance Standard for the Data Control Waveform; MIL-STD-2045-44500, National Imagery Transmission Standard (NITFS); and Tactical Communications Protocol 2 (TACO2).  Hardware and Software shall be user friendly to allow non-technica l users to operate the system and be able to transmit imagery in Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) Image Compression for the National Imagery Transmission Format Standard (MIL-STD-188-198A with Notice 2). The LVRS shall be configurable for use on var ious platforms, i.e. vehicle, aircraft, and man-portable. The LVRS shall consist of the following major components: an out station and a base station.  The outstation consists of a camera with a removable image intensified night channel (I2 tube will be provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)) to include  a lightweight handheld portable processor and a sensor with day/night capabilities, which can be remotely triggered.  A remote shall give the operator the ability to remotely control the modular sensor (e.g. focus, zoom, capture, save) and send still fram e images when the handle held portable processor is being operated from a remote location.  Image compression and military communication interfaces allow the user to record digital still frames.  Standard military batteries power the camera.  The outstatio n will also interface with organic communication equipment.  The day sensor system will capture and transmit still-frame color images to the base station when frame integration is turned off.  Otherwise, the images are monochrome.  It will provide digital compression and transmission of images.  It will be operable by soldiers in a field environment wearing cold weather equipment and/or Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) clothing.  The LVRS shall also provide an interface to a National Television Systems  Committee (NTSC) video in and video out sources.  The resident software shall be capable of manipulating, compressing, capturing, recording, and transmitting still frame and multi-frame images that will allow the base station operator to recognize a light  vehicle with a probability of 70% out to a range of 1500 meters in daylight with a 7-kilometer visibility conditions.  The out station will not be aco ustically detectable by unaided hearing at any range greater than 5 meters.  The base station consists of imagery compression/decompression and communications interface hardware, a monitor, and a color image printer.  The base station can be operated in a HMMWV, M577, or any other shelter with a 115-volt alternating current, 12-volt or 24-volt DC power supply source.  It will interface with organic communication equipment, retransmit to other base stations, and receive images from the outstation without any  discernable loss of resolution or image quality.  The base station will store multiple images capable of being selected and displayed on a video monitor.  In addition, it will record outstation spot reports and salute reports on the printed copy of the im age or on the retransmitted image.  The base station will not be acoustically detectable by unaided hearing at any range greater than 50 meters. This equipment is to be Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) / Non-Developmental (NDI) or COTS/NDI with minor modifications which include but are not limited to hardening for field and inclement weather use and Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI).  This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP).  This is limited only to contractors currently manufacturing systems capable of providing a completely integrated end-to-end system, who can provide a complete end-to-end working system and must submit technical information, i n writing, no later than 27 December 2002, to Project Manager Soldier Sensors and Equipment; Product Manager Multi-Spectrum Sensors; ATTN: Jaime Gonzalez; 10401 Totten Road; Fort Belvoir, Virginia 22060-5806.

<CONTACT>Carlos R McKenzie, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 286-0599, Fax (301) 286-0214, Email Carlos.R.McKenzie@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information from potential sources, comments, and inputs concerning the availability, cost, and specifications of a Ka-Band Solid State Power Amplifier (SSPA) for the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Project. SDO is the first mission under the Living with a Star (LWS) Program as part of the Sun Earth Connection.  SDO will be made up of 3 instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing our understanding of the solar process and space weather.     SDO is viewed as a follow on to the highly successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission.  SDO will be a three-axis stabilized satellite, geosynchronous orbit at ~105°W longitude, and mission life of 5 years with consumables for 10 years.	   SDO will provide a continuous downlink of high rate data (150-200 Mbps, Reed Solomon and Rate ½ Convolutionally Encoded). The transmitted data will SQPSK modulate a Ka-band carrier (25.5-27 GHz) in the SDO modulator/exciter.   The exciter will drive the SSPA, which will generate 5 to 10 Watts RF into a 0.5 meter dish, yielding an EIRP from the spacecraft of 44-47 dBW.  Other preliminary specifications for the SDO SSPA are as follows: 1.	Spacecraft bus voltage:  28 +/- 7 volts 2.	 RF input power: 0 dBm min. 3.	 RF output power (including output isolator):  +37 to +40 dBm min.  4.   Output frequency/bandwidth: ~26.5 GHz +/- 250 MHz min. 5.	 Gain flatness (peak-to-peak) across band: 0.3 dB 6.	  AM/PM: &lt;= 8 degrees 7.	  Phase nonlinearity across band (peak-to-peak): 3.5 degrees 8.	Operational temperature range (baseplate):	0 to +50 C  9.	    RF input connector:  K-female  (2.9 mm jack) 10.	   RF output connector:  WR-34 11. SSPA telemetry:  internal PA temperature, RF output power, TBD electrical interface 12. Input and output VSWRs:  1.5:1 or better 13.    Random Vibration test profile (all axes, 2 minutes duration per axis):  0.013 g2/Hz at 20 Hz, +6 dB/octave from 20-50 Hz, 0.08 g2/Hz from 50-800 Hz, +6 dB/octave from 800-2000 Hz, 0.013 g2/Hz at 2000 Hz, 10.0 grms overall. 14.      Shock requirement:	Shock specification is TBD, not to exceed the following spectrum (max. at the source):  10g from 10-100 Hz, 10-2000g from 100-1000 Hz, and 2000g from 1000-10,000 Hz. 15.   Parts radiation requirement: Dependent on enclosure material/thickness.  For example, radiation requirement is 120 krad total dose with a 100 mil thick Al enclosure, or 30 krad total dose with a 200 mil thick Al enclosure. 16.      Parts quality requirement:  Quality Level 1 (per GSFC 311-INST-001) parts shall be selected when readily available.  For those parts not readily available, Quality Level 2 parts, with additional testing as required by GSFC, shall be acceptable.   17.      Total mass:  2 kg. max. 18.     Required DC input power:  &lt; 35 Watts for 5 W RF output, &lt; 70 Watts for 10 W RF output NASA/GSFC may procure up to three (3) flight Ka-band SSPAs.	 However, in order to accurately specify the requirements of the SSPA, the SDO project seeks feedback from industry regarding the above specifications.  Responses from industry that have expertise in providing Ka-band Solid state power amplifiers and associated equipment is encouraged.  In addition to the technical questions above, please indicate your company’s relevant history associated with the development of Ka Band space flight or military hardware.   Also, feedback regarding any other relevant specifications not mentioned is requested.   Are any of the specifications not realistic with respect to today’s technology, a significant cost driver to achieve that performance, or unnecessarily over specified to achieve the necessary performance?  For Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier (TWTA) manufacturers, please explain why a TWTA may be a reasonable alternative to an SSPA for this application and compare relevant specifications. All information received will be combined and used for government procurement and planning purposes.  Sources are urged to describe their approach in enough detail so that NASA can plan for subsequent proposal opportunities for which proprietary information may be appropriate.   The information received in response to this RFI will be reviewed and summarized by a panel of government and industry experts.  Some or part of the summarized and synthesized recommendations may or may not form the basis of a future NASA solicitation. Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of twelve(12) pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.  Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm,  size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).	Technical questions should be directed to: Mr. Michael Powers.   Procurement related questions should be directed to Carlos McKenzie. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in Internet "Note A".  [INTERNET ONLY (commercial product definition)] No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these cites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.   This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered  in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.

The symposium participants will include local, state, and federal chief information officers, congressional staffers, elected and appointed officials, and public safety executives.  The PSWN Program envisions an informative panel discussion by users of existing wireless solutions, manufacturers, and commercial service providers.  Also, there is an opportunity for vendors to set up tabletop exhibits for participants to ask additional questions about their solutions.  The vendor panel [up to seven (7) seats] is planned for January 29, 2003 from 2:45-3:45 p.m..  The information shared during this panel discussion should focus on current technical solutions, but should be presented in an easy to understand format for participants from both more technical and less technical backgrounds.  Approximately 10 tabletop exhibits are planned for January 29, 2003 from 3:45-5:30 p.m.  Vendors will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.  Any arrangements or costs including a $75 skirted table will be the responsibility of the vendor.  The symposium co-sponsors will not provide transportation, per diem, or other resources or support for vendors participating in the discussion or exhibit.  Vendors desiring to send a representative to participate in the panel and/or the tabletop exhibits should make their request via e-mail (preferred), by fax, or in writing to: Mrs. Carole Kirsch, PSWN Program, P.O. Box 3926, Fairfax, VA 22038, (E-mail cakirsch@earthlink.net, Phone: 703-279-2006, Fax: 703-279-2032).  Requests must specify company and participant by name, and provide the following point-of-contact information: business mailing address, telephone and fax numbers, and email address.  Requests should be received no later than Monday, December 30, 2002.  Participation in the symposium and exhibit will be confirmed by Friday, January 10, 2003.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Automatic Power Transfer Switch (APTS)
<DESC>MARKET SURVEY
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

RFI Reference No. WMOK-03-001

Description 

The Air Armament Center, Combat Support Systems Program Office at Eglin AFB, FL in partnership with the 311 Human Systems Wing, Brooks AFB, TX seeks sources and information related to a program for an Automatic Power Transfer Switch (APTS) compatible with the Collectively Protected (CP) Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) system and other Joint Service expeditionary power needs required for operations at remote austere locations under toxic wartime and peacetime environments.  NAICS Code:  335311; Power, Distribution and Specialty Transformer Manufacturing; Size Standard:  750.
         The APTS is a power switching device, in line with the primary power source, capable of starting a standby power source (generator) and switching the electrical load to insure no loss of power to the system under control.  The proposed switch may also be used on other critical systems requiring uninterrupted power.  The APTS will be used outdoors, in fine particle (dusty) environments, Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) and non-NBC modes, and will be required to operate in temperature extremes of -25?F to +125?F and capable of being stored in temperatures ranging from -40?F to +140?F.
The APTS shall have a continuous rating of 600 amperes.  All voltage and current transformers furnished shall be rated for a minimum of this current level.
The device furnished shall have a voltage rating of 600 volts.  The nominal operating voltage shall be 208 volts, wye connected, 3 phase, 50/60 Hz.  The APTS shall operate satisfactorily at a voltage range of plus or minus five percent of the nominal voltage rating.
The APTS shall have field adjustable parameters such as time delays for the sensing features listed below, adjustable delays for normal to emergency operation and vice-versa, programmable or adjustable transition, etc.
The APTS shall have the sensing capabilities such as, under-voltage sensing, over-voltage sensing, frequency sensing, voltage imbalance sensing, phase rotation sensing, and loss of single-phase detection.
The APTS shall include a two-wire remote start kit that will interface with existing government generators.  These kits should be designed to fit the MEP 806A, MEP 006 and MEP 007 family of generators.  For more information on the MEP family of generators please visit the following website, http://www.pmmep.org.  
The APTS shall have six (6) input connectors compatible with the military provided secondary distribution center (SDC).  The connectors are to be compatible with standard military cabling systems using the plug and receptacle assemblies with Amphenol Mil-C-22992 Class L Connectors.  When commercial power is used in place of the SDC it will be required that the APTS have an input terminal block of sufficient capacity to handle the current of the system.  The APTS shall additionally require six (6) Class L output connectors along with a terminal block that are of sufficient size to carry the total load of the system.  The terminal block shall have provisions for 3 phase conductors, a neutral conductor and a ground conductor.  A door or other means to prevent accidental contact by operating personnel shall protect this terminal block.
All components of the electrical control system shall be weatherproof.  Enclosure(s) must be better or equivalent to the NEMA 4 or IP56.  See NEMA Standards Publication 250-1997 and International Electro technical Commission standard IEC 61969.  The container shall be designed to minimize damage from routine handling that would compromise the functionality of the unit.  The device shall be able to withstand extended vibration similar to secured cargo transport by conventional trucks, semi-trailers, flatbed transports, and forklifts (loading and unloading) without suffering any damage.  Unacceptable damage resulting from vibration may represent itself as loose connections, cracked welds, loose wiring, leaking seals, etc.
The government will provide all the interface equipment for the APTS such as line-side supply transformers and back-up generators.  The vendor shall provide all capability for the APTS to sense power outages, the intelligence to start the back-up generator, switch from the primary source to the back-up source and close the generator breaker.  The vendor shall also provide the modification kit to install on the government provided generators that provides a two-wire remote start capability.
The APTS shall have a fault current rating sufficient to handle any fault current it is subjected to from the b deployed base power grid, commercial power, or a stand-alone generator (mentioned earlier) providing power to the facility.  In order to promote an environment of teaming/partnering for a possible new acquisition, we are involving industry in the very early development of this acquisition. In order to initiate an exchange of information, we are requesting that interested parties submit any or both of the following: (1) an up to 10 page paper, with pictures/sketches if applicable, that identifies existing solutions for such a transfer unit, and (2) product brochures or marketing materials. Responses to this Market Survey/Request for Information should be mailed to AAC/WMO, 314 W. Choctawhatchee Ave, Suite 104, Attn: Lt Brant Lagoon or Mr. Gregory Harris, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5717.

"This Market Survey/Request for Information is for planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a Request For Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any follow-on acquisitions. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Market Survey/Request for Information or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of responses to this Market Survey/Request for Information and the Government use of this information.

<SUBJECT>D -- Development and Enhancement of the Internet based Market Research Library
<DESC>1. PLEASE SEE: NOTE 22

SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS

2.	Reason for sole source procurement:

The current vendor has designed and developed a customized solution for the U.S. & Foreign Commercial Service (USFCS).  Market Research Library (MRL) application developed by vendor is not available on the open market.  MRL is a mission critical function of USFCS' service delivery to US SME (small-to-medium sized enterprises) exporters.  Any break in service would cause a disruption of this service.  USFCS overseas personnel would be unable to provide timely reports to the MRL which could adversely impact competitive position vis-?-vis market intelligence of US exporters in foreign markets.  If there is an interruption in service or development of the MRL, USFCS would not be able to meet deadlines imposed by OMB to interface MRL data with USG export portal.

2.	Summary of Required Services:

Development and enhancement of existing USFCS Market Research Library, USFCS Trade Services Directory, USFCS internal Internet based web applications, USFCS trade lead and USFCS online single company promotion programs and online registration/logon interface with www.export.gov.

Specifically:

"	Ability to maintain, further design & develop and enhance a web - based online database.  To include:
o	Database search and sort capability,
o	Database record presentation to the public
o	Database field and record features
o	Ability to modify, change and enhance web-based database user interface
o	Continue development and enhancement of an internal upload process for USFCS domestic and international and market research.
"	Design and implementation of data syndication with selected USFCS external web sites. Continue development of vehicle to share/publish USFCS market research with USFCS internal and external partner web sites.
"	Design and implementation of statistical tracking tools for USFCS management. For example, statistics that provide feedback regarding amount of instances a specific record is accessed.
"	Ability to design an automated data dissemination service, using email, based on external and internal client profiles-e.g. "push" technology.
"	Ability to design and build email address books (for, individuals & groups) for the purpose of distributing market research via email.  In addition, the capability to track/monitor the number and frequency of automated emails sent.
"	Ability to design and develop platform to query data from existing internal USFCS databases.
"	Site hosting.
"	Ability to design a user interface, including, building custom graphics & navigation that is consistent with USFCS branding.
"	Ability to troubleshoot internal USFCS user problems and questions.
"	Ability to program a database that can exchange data in a decentralized, distributed environment.

Deliverables:
"	Completion of Section 2 tasks by December 31, 2003
"	An internet - based database enabling:
o	USFCS internal users to populate the database via the internet from offices worldwide
o	USFCS clients to conduct intuitive searches for USFCS market research, trade leads & service provider data via an internet browser.
"	An internet-based database featuring an automated dissemination system, using email to "push" relevant data to clients based on client profile.
"	Registration and log-in interface with the USG's export portal www.export.gov
"	Internet-based administrative area enabling Market Research Program Manager to edit, approve, delete report.
"	Internet-based aggregated statistics area enabling USFCS senior management to track internet database activity.
"	Secure database hosting with redundant systems, 24/7 support and minimum T1 bandwidth.
"	High-end intuitive user interface design.  Individual database records that can support picture/graphics/logos.

3.	Uniqueness of  Present Contractor:
ASI has customized the database to fit the particular needs of USFCS. For example;
"	Specific field naming & structuring of database for USFCS market research reports,
"	Structuring of the data fields to support specific USFCS market research reports including charts, graphics, pictures & logos,
"	Routing of database report approvals to specific USFCS personnel dispersed worldwide,
"	Specific experience programming in the following combination of technologies: SQL, ColdFusion, HTML and JavaScript.

With cooperation from department CIO, ASI developed interface between ASI development servers (database & web) and USFCS internal/production servers, and has been granted access to remotely maintain MRL server within USFCS network.

Database structured with a combination of SQL, ColdFusion, HTML and JavaScript which, if re-created by another vendor, would require development period and thus cause unacceptable downtime.

ASI developed authentication between internal USFCS servers and market research servers, approval granted to ASI by department CIO.

Project development and enhancement would be adversely impacted, and USFCS/clients would to be served, if ASI were not able to complete work in progress.  If project work stopped, or was required to begin anew with another vendor, client service delivery would be negatively impacted.  Any break in service would cause a disruption of
this service.  USFCS overseas personnel would be unable to provide timely reports to the MRL which could adversely impact competitive position vis-?-vis market intelligence of US exporters in foreign markets.

The small disadvantaged business goal in that subcontracting plan shall not be less than 5% of the subcontracted work.  This goal of not less than 5% also applies to women-owned small business concerns.  A subcontracting plan is not required from firms classified as a small business.  Effective 1 October 1997, A/E contractors are now required to register their firms in the Central Contractor Registration database prior to receiving a contract award.  This database provides basic business information, capabilities, and financial information to the Government and complies with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, which requires Federal agencies to have the Taxpayer Identification Number of every contractor and to pay every contractor through electronic funds transfer.  A/E contractors will only have to provide this information once with annual updates or as key company information changes occur.  Registration can be accomplished through the World Wide Web at http//www.acq.mil/ec; through any DOD Certified Value Added Network; or a paper may be obtained by calling the DOD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.   Provide SF 254 and SF 255 packages to: Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Engineering Field Activity Chesapeake (Attn: Code CH2A - Randolph Jones), Washington Navy Yard, Building 212, 1314 Harwood St., SE, Washington, DC 20374-5018.
