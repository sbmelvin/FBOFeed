<DESC>[BASIC STATEMENT OF REQUIREMENT] NASA/DFRC has a requirement for four video cameras capable of capturing images for the Abort Flight Test parachute system performance assessment. [SPECIFICATIONS] 1)	Basic Imaging Requirement 2)	Video imaging from on-board sources is required to support the assessment of parachute deployment dynamics during pad abort and ascent abort testing for the Orion crew vehicle. 3)	Required Camera Image Characteristics a)	Image Resolution: Captured images shall be appropriate for dynamic parachute deployment analysis with a resolution of at least 640 x 480 pixels. b)	Frame Rate: Image frames shall be captured at the normal NTSC format of 30 frames per second.  c)	Field of View: The required field of view will be 107 degrees Horizontal by 80 degrees vertical which is consistent with the field of view of a 3.5 mm focal length lens. d)	Image Coloration Format: Video information shall be acquired in a color format as defined by the NTSC format specification. e)	Video Image Exposure: Video shutter speed, aperture, and imaging device sensitivity shall be determined and established by the camera exposure control to automatically provide properly exposed images of events for capturing the parachute deployment event with minimal blur commensurate with available lighting conditions. 4)	Environmental Conditions and Survivability: The video imaging system shall both survive and operate satisfactorily under the following environmental conditions on the day of launch: a)	Ambient Pressure: The video cameras shall operate in an ambient pressure environment consistent with atmospheric conditions at sea level and 3-minute exposure to altitudes up to 200k feet during the launch to the test condition. Ambient pressure at 200k feet is 0.401 pounds/square foot (as derived from the 1976 Standard Atmosphere reference). b)	Ambient Temperature: The video cameras shall operate in ambient temperature at sea level up to 176º F and down to -40 F.  c)	Vibration: The video cameras shall be designed to operate under an ambient vibration environment up to 25 GRMS for 3 minutes during the launch to the test condition. d)	Acceleration: The video cameras shall be designed to operate under steady state acceleration in each axis up to 25 g during the 3-minute launch to the test condition e)	Shock: The video cameras shall operate while being subjected to shock levels up to 13,900 G during the pyrotechnic-driven stage separation and parachute deployments. 5)	The video camera performance shall not be adversely affected under the following environmental conditions for a period of up to 180 Days. a)	Humidity: The video cameras shall be designed to operate in relative humidity levels up to 95% without performance degradation (guidance from MIL-STD-810) b)	Salt Spray, Fog, Dust, and Fungus: The video cameras shall be designed to operate under conditions of salt spray, fog, dust, and fungus atmosphere consistent with a sub-tropical seashore environment (guidance from MIL-STD-810) 6)	The video cameras shall be stored, handled, and shipped according to approved procedures for flight-rated equipment used for aerospace testing. 7)	Video camera power, weight, and volume requirements a)	Weight: The combined weight of all components of each video camera exclusive of the connecting cable shall be less than 2 lbs. b)	Volume: The combined volume of all components of each video camera exclusive of the connecting cable shall be less than 50 cubic inches. c)	Power: Each video camera shall require less than 10 watts from the 12 volt power source.

[SOLE SOURCE EXPLANATION] NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the items from Ecliptic Enterprises Incorporated because Ecliptic has expertise in the broad range of disciplines required to address the needs of aerospace applications that no other commercial organization is known to possess. The hardware is designed and manufactured to withstand hard use, fabricated to operate and survive in the extreme flight environments. The video imaging equipment is fabricated to interface with avionics equipment on the flight. If other sources were used system designs would need to be re-engineered at an unacceptable cost in time and resources. No other commercial sources with these assets are known to exist. [FOLLOW-UP AND LEGAL] The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and 13. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 15, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are NOT acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>East and Central Africa Global Competitiveness Hub (ECA Hub) activities form part of the U.S. Government's Trade for African Development and Enterprise (TRADE) Initiative.  The TRADE Initiative seeks to mobilize U.S. and African partners from the public and private sectors to support specific trade capacity building needs. Three regional Hubs have been established in Accra, Ghana; Gaborone, Botswana; and Nairobi, Kenya.  The Trade Hubs facilitate capacity building activities through linkages with African regional trade organizations and networks, in collaboration with U.S. and African educational and business networks, U.S. and African government agencies, and other donors.   

The TRADE Initiative has six themes, namely to:

"	Enhance the competitiveness of East and Central African (ECA) products and services;
"	Expand the role that trade can play in African poverty reduction strategies;
"	Promote U.S.- ECA business linkages;
"	Improve the delivery of public services supporting trade;
"	Strengthen ECA capacity for trade policy formulation and implementation; and
"	Strengthen the enabling environment for ECA businesses.

Based in Nairobi, the ECA Hub covers Burundi, Central African Republic, Comoros, Congo (Brazzaville), Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa), Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.
  
The contractor for the ECA Hub will be required to work with the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA), a principal partner to REDSO based in Lusaka, Zambia, and the Transit Transport Coordinating Authority of the Northern Corridor (TTCA) based in Mombasa, Kenya. Other partners will be engaged in as far as their activities promote COMESA agenda of creating a common market where goods, services and people move freely using standards adopted from the World Trade Organization. The ECA Hub will ensure that trade between Africa and the U.S is promoted under the African Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA).  Promoting efficient customs facilitation will be important to ensure seamless movement of goods from one country to another. Enterprise capacity building and linkages for the export market will be another area of concern. The Northern Corridor from Mombasa to Democratic Republic of Congo) will act as a fast track model for all the activities the Hub will implement in the region. 
 
In summary, to achieve the objectives of the TRADE Initiative through the ECA Hub, USAID/REDSO is pursuing improvements in four key areas:
"	Building capacity for trade policy formulation and implementation with specific emphasis on the World Trade Organization and COMESA;
"	Promoting business development and market linkages under the African Growth and Opportunity Act;
"	Harmonizing customs and trade facilitation policies for the countries (Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo) covered under the Hub taking the Northern Corridor countries as the model;
"	Increasing efficiency and reducing the cost of trade related transportation on the Northern Corridor and creating an operating model for replication by other interested parties in other corridors.

The ECA Hub was opened in October 2002, and the first year of operations is being implemented under a one year, $1.5 million contract between USAID/REDSO and Chemonics International.  The work plan for the first year of the ECA Hub will be provided with the RFP. The soon to be issued RFP for the ECA Hub will require a firm to implement this activity from the second to the fifth year (four-year performance period) starting in late September 2003.

The RFP document will be posted to FBO approximately (15-19) days from this Synopsis posting. The Solicitation number will be RFP: 623-03-014. No additional notice will be given concerning the RFP Solicitation date of issuance/posting.  Once the RFP Solicitation is posted to http://www.fbo.gov/ website, this will allow you to view/download/print the document to prepare your submission, if your organization decides to submit a proposal.  The RFP Solicitation will also identify the government website(s) to view/download/print any forms which must be used by offerors submitting a proposal.  The Office issuing the RFP Solicitation will NOT mail forms or hard RFP copies out.   

The Cover Letter to the RFP Solicitation will advise that there will be approximately (15) calendar days from the RFP issuance date allowed for the electronic submission of questions about any Section of the RFP document.  Approximately week later, the USAID will post to http://www.fbo.gov/ answers to all questions by issuing an Amendment to the RFP Solicitation.  Questions submitted after (15) day period may be answered (and, possibly, another Amendment may need to be issued) however, extending the RFP's closing date is NOT considered.

<DESC>BLM Request for Proposals, NAR080001, IMPACT STUDY FOR THE SALE OF FEDERAL HELIUM RESERVE. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Operations Center (NOC) intends to award a sole source contract to National Academy of Sciences, Office of Contracts & Grants, 2101 Constitution Avenue, Washington, DC 20418 for the continuation of a study to determine whether selling off the Helium Reserve in the manner prescribed in Public Law 104-273 has had any adverse effect on U.S. scientific, technical, biomedical, and national security users of helium.  Public Law 104-273 initially called for a National Academy of Sciences study to determine the impact of selling the Reserve using the pricing mechanism described in the Law. The first study was completed in 1998. Given recent challenges experienced by the helium market and their impact on pricing and availability of cryogenic helium to the scientific community in particular, it is now possible to reevaluate the impact of selling the helium reserve under the current pricing mechanism and to determine whether there are adjustments that would optimize future availability of helium for its many scientific and industrial uses. To provide a meaningful context for this effort, the study will examine the helium market and the helium supply chain. A cost-type contract is anticipated, with a period of performance of approximately twelve to fourteen months.  The contractor must gather data and provide reports on various topics such as: Estimated helium demand for research use over the next decade; Impact of helium shortages on helium supply for Federal grant-based research versus helium funding supplied from other sources; Ensuring helium supply for research purposes, and assessment and projection of helium markets; The contractor will also provide expertise on topics such as: Applications of helium (e.g., low-temperature physics, other areas of basic physics and chemistry research, cryogenics for biomedicine, specialty welding, specialty materials, and liquid-fueled rocket operations); Helium production and distribution and closely related industries (production of compressed gases, helium separations and refining, industrial materials management and purchasing, and helium recycling), and Economics and finance (compressed gas economics, econometric modeling, commodity brokerage). All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by the BLM. Send information for technical evaluation to Steve Santoro at (303) 236-3518 by November 14, 2007. See Note 22.

<b><u>Biodiesel Processing and Energy Production Plant Project </u></b>
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study for the Biodiesel Processing and Energy Production Plant Project.

Biodiesel is a diesel-equivalent fuel derived from biological sources.  Among its advantages is the fact that it is a renewable resource, it burns cleaner than fossil fuel-based diesel, and it can be utilized without modifying vehicle engines.  Biodiesel can be produced from several feedstocks, including soybeans, rapeseed, and animal fats; however, the most efficient process utilizes palm oil.  Indonesia is the world's largest palm oil producer of palm oil.   For several years the U.S. government has promoted increased domestic usage of biodiesel and other biofuels (such as ethanol) for their inherent energy security and environmental benefits; more recently, international efforts such as those undertaken by the Indonesian and Brazilian governments have been encouraged.  

While a relative newcomer in the use of biofuels, Indonesia's domestic industry is rapidly developing as a result of the government's aggressive promotion of increased production as a means to reduce the country's reliance on imported petroleum.  The government's recently revised "National Energy Policy" set production targets for a variety of alternative energy sources; this policy targets biofuels to represent five percent of the national energy mix by 2025.  Although Indonesia currently produces less than one sixth of the amount needed to reach this target, its status as the second largest palm oil producer leads many industry analysts to conclude that Indonesia can reach its goal and become a major producer of biodiesel.  

Palm oil production serves as an important component of North Sumatra's agricultural-based economy; however, leading producers such as PT Perkebunan Nusantara III (PTPN III) are intent on diversifying into higher-value products.  This project would assist PTPN III in its efforts to develop a biodiesel processing facility capable of producing approximately 118 million liters of biodiesel annually on its 110,000 hectare palm oil plantation in North Sumatra.  PTPN III intends to sell the biodiesel to PT Pertamina, Indonesia's state-owned oil company and primary biodiesel distributor, for use in domestic markets.  In addition, the project would also utilize the palm waste generated as a byproduct of the production process to feed into a power plant to serve both the processing facility and the local community.  This study would assess the technical, economic and financial feasibility of the proposed biodiesel processing facility and the accompanying palm waste power plant, including the sale and transmission of the surplus energy to PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara, the state-owned electricity company, for use in its local power grid.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for this study include the following tasks: 1) Preliminary Review, Data Collection and Site Visit; 2) Technical Analysis; 3) Economic Analysis; 4) Financial Analysis; 5) Regulatory Analysis; 6) Developmental Impact Analysis; 7) Preliminary Environmental Analysis; 8) Implementation Plan; 9) U.S. sources of supply; and 10) Final Report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $540,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: <b><a href=https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp>https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp</a></b>.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, <u>NOVEMBER 16, 2007</u>, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), 8725 John J. Kingman Road, Room 3830, Fort Belvoir, Virginia 22060-6222

Description

DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the water distribution system and the wastewater collection system at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  
The Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:
Installation: Fort A.P. Hill
Location: Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia
Installation Description:  Fort A. P. Hill (APH) is located approximately 80 miles south of Washington D.C., Fort A.P. Hill is a U.S. Army Installation serving every component of the U.S. Armed Forces, active and reserve, and several other agencies of the U.S. Government including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the State Department.
Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

a.	Water Distribution System:
The potable water utility system at APH is composed of eight independent components including; Headquarter Areas, Central Camp, Cooke Camp, Pender Camp, and Rappahannock sites.  Wilcox, Archer, and Anderson area potable water systems are stand-alone, but can be connected to the Headquarters Area system when needed.  The water distribution systems consist of water wells, chlorination disinfection systems, booster pumps, water storage tanks, water mains, fire hydrants, isolation valves, air release valves and service lines.  
A unique requirement of the APH potable water system is to accommodate the National Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Jamboree that has been held at APH every four years since 1981. The actual BSA Jamboree lasts for only 10 days, but takes months to prepare the potable water system to accommodate the potable water demands from the Jamborees enormous attendance. It is estimated that APH hosts approximately 30,000 boy scouts and nearly 300,000 visitors during the Jamboree.
Water Sources
Water sources for Fort A.P. Hill are the Aquia, Middle and Lower Potomac aquifers. There are 25 active wells that draw water from the aquifers and supply the distribution systems.

The water systems within APH provide water for both domestic and fire protection use. With few exceptions, lines are located adjacent to roadways and fire hydrants readily accessible and each fire hydrant has its own isolation valve. Isolation valves are located near most pipe intersections making it easy to isolate portions of the system. The normal distribution pressure is approximately 54 pounds per square inch (psi) and is adequate for fire protection.

The water distribution system consists of pipes size raging from 1 to 24 inches. The total length of the pipe is approximately 256,00 linear feet.


b.	Wastewater Collection System 
The wastewater collection system at APH consists of gravity lines, equalization basins, lift stations and force mains that transport the wastewater generated to treatment facilities.  The wastewater collection system at APH can be divided into two sections.  The Main Cantonment section includes the areas where generated wastewater flows to the Wilcox Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) for treatment.  The second section includes the outlying areas where the wastewater treatment occurs within the specific area.  

Equalization Basins
Some of the areas within the Main Cantonment have equalization basins.  The basins are located near lift stations and their primary purpose is to store flows to the lift station that are greater than the pump capacity.  When the flow to the lift station is greater than the lift station pump capacity, the excess flow is transferred to the equalization basins.  When the flow to the lift station is less than lift stations pump capacity and if there is any wastewater in the equalization basin, the wastewater flows by gravity from the basin to the lift station.  Some of the basins have aeration to keep particles in suspension.  The aeration does provide treatment and assists in reducing the potential for hydrogen sulfide development


The wastewater generated at Main Cantonment area facilities flow to gravity collections lines, then on to a lift station where it is pumped to other gravity collection lines and eventually on to the Wilcox Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).  The plant is located in the southeast portion of APH. Only a small portion of the wastewater generated at APH flows by gravity directly to the WWTP.  
The sub-areas that make up the Main Cantonment area are: Mahone, Jackson, HETH, Davis, Lake Travis, Rodes, Longstreet, Wilcox, Archer ASP, Anderson Headquarters and Naval Area. 
The wastewater collection system in the Main Cantonment area consists of pipes size raging from less than 4 to 12-inches. The total length of the pipe is 30.3 miles with approximately 380 manholes. 

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.  Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for an award to a small business are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.  Interested sources shall contact Doug Smith at 703-767-9409 to be added to our bidder mailing list.

<DESC>The Defense Depot Susquehanna Pennsylvania (DDSP) has a requirement for a contractor to provide all labor, management, personnel, equipment and supplies to perform janitorial services in approximately seventy (70) buildings at DDSP on a Firm-Fixed-Price basis.

The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror using the Best Value/Trade-off Source Selection Process.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The anticipated period of performance for the base year is 01 Jan 08 through 31 Dec 08.  The BPAs will have two option years.  A sample list of items is attached and shall be the basis for the price comparison o n this solicitation.  The Governments objective is to award at least three, but possibly more BPAs.

Usually the requirements from USAMMCE are urgent and cannot be filled by the normal medical logistics supply chain using DSCP, ECAT or the Prime Vendors.   The Government seeks to establish acquisition relat ionships with medical consumable distributors who have established relationships with many manufacturers in order to offer to the Government a streamlined, cost effective, and efficient manner in which to purchase many different types of medical consumable  products.  Evaluation criteria are Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.  The solicitation will be available on or about 01 October 2007 at www.usamraa.army.mil.

<DESC>TITLE:  F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) Modernization Program BACKGROUND:  The F-15 ESTS Modernization Program is an Aeronautical  Systems Center (ASC) program.  The F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS)  is an Intermediate  level support equipment system providing maintenance  & repair for approximately 50 F-15 Line Replaceable Units (LRU).  The  system consists of a station, Interface Test Adapters (ITA), ancillary  equipment, and associated cables located at all F-15 operating locations  and the depot at Robins as well as Northrop-Grumman, Rolling Meadows, Ill.  The station (62 units) itself will become increasingly difficult to  maintain and ultimately unsustainable beginning in FY08 unless known  obsolescence for a variety of component parts is addressed.  A projected  component obsolescence analysis is attached for reference purposes. PURPOSE:  The F-15 Systems Group, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting a  survey to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise,  capabilities, and experience to analyze ESTS station instrument  obsolescence as currently fielded, identify potential solutions for same,  and demonstrate capability to replace obsolete parts as necessary.  The  overarching program objective is to avoid stations becoming Not Mission  Capable (NMC).  The government plans to issue, at a later date, a request  for proposal that will require offerors to provide a plan that provides  retrofit hardware improvements addressing obsolete parts within the  planned funding profile and meets the overarching program objective.  The  planned funding profile is as follows:  FY08 - $4.5M, FY09 - $12.1M,  FY10 - $13.4M, FY11 - $19.6M.  Respondents should maximize addressing the  projected component obsolescence issues within the planned funding  profile, i.e., address as many components as possible with the given  amount of funding.  In addition, offerors will be required to demonstrate  improvement to station MTBF as well as meeting the current performance  requirements.  In order to assist respondents with replying to this  sources sought synopsis a draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) is attached. CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY:  Firms responding to this announcement  should indicate whether they are a large or small business, small  disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, HUB Zone small  business and/or service disabled veteran-owned small business.  In  addition to the information requested above, please provide the following  information:  Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, CAGE Code, Phone  Number, E-mail address, Web Page URL.  In addition to the information  above, interested firms should also submit sufficient information (limited  to 25 pages) that will permit insight into their technical capabilities. 1.	Provide experience and expertise in aspects related to addressing  obsolescence of electronic equipment in general and specifically  obsolescence associated with support equipment. 2.

<DESC>A PUBLIC MEETING WILL BE HELD ON WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 10, 2007 FROM 4:00 TO 6:00 PM AT THE VISITOR CENTER (BLDG 6130) AT NAVAL STATION GREAT LAKES, ILLINOIS.

This notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP); it is a solicitation to invite interested parties to submit information that explores in depth all viable, practical and feasible options for use, including but not limited to, reuse, lease, enhanced-use lease, rehab, banking, mothballing, moving off base, disposal, and/or demolition for Building 76 Red Cross Building and Building 151 Camp Barry Dorm at Naval Station Great Lakes, Lake County, Illinois. 

The intent of this sources sought notice is to identify potential interested parties to explore feasible alternative uses of Buildings 76 and 151. Feasible alternatives must consider security concerns associated with properties located on a federal military installation, therefore any proposals for adaptive reuse or potential tenants must be able to fulfill the security requirements of being located at Naval Station Great Lakes. 

Buildings 76 and 151 are major contributing structures to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station Historic District, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1987. The boundary of the historic district covers a large area that includes portions of the Main side, Hospital side, and Camp Barry areas of the station and contains buildings that were part of the original ca. 1906 station development. Building 76, the American Red Cross building, is located just east of the main entrance. Building 151 is one of six receiving dormitories that are nearly identical in appearance and is located south of the main gate, in the Camp Barry area of the base.

The buildings are in severely deteriorated physical condition, including failing roof systems, extensive water leaks, and severely deteriorated interior ceilings, walls, floors, and interior furnishings. The buildings have been vacant since 2004 and due to their extremely deteriorated physical condition, constitute a safety and health hazard to personnel and guests of Naval Station Great Lakes. 

Proposed actions associated with these facilities have the potential to result in an adverse effect to historic properties within an established historic district listed in the NRHP. The Navy has intensively explored various alternatives to demolition including adaptive reuse, pursued several tenant options, however none of these arrangements proved to be successful. 

A public meeting will be held by the Navy on WEDNESDAY October 10, 2007 from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM at the Visitor Center (Building 6130 - Badge and Pass) at Naval Station Great Lakes, Farragut Ave., Great Lakes, IL., 60088, (847)688-5648, at which time any person is welcome to attend and be heard on this matter.

Interested parties may make written inquires (via mail or e-mail) by TUESDAY October 23, 2007:

<DESC>A. General Information:
The Heartland Region, TRBO Region 5, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 5 Army, Navy, and Air Force, medical treatment facilities (MTF's) in Ohio, Kentucky, and Illinois announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of IV Infusion Pumps, Tubing and Supplies. The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. A single selection is intended in this project; however, the Heartland Region acknowledges the possibility of multiple selections for this agreement. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Clinics, Illinois, Naval Health Clinics Great Lakes, Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital, Ft Campbell Kentucky, and Ireland Army Community Hospital, Ft Knox, Kentucky.
This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor Program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, (DSCP) Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) with the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items.  This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is NOT a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime Vendor program please access the web site at: https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil 
The agreement with incentive pricing will be based on a committed volume for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from the date of award with three (3) - 12 month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  A single selection is intended in this project; however, the Heartland Region acknowledges the possibility of multiple selections for this agreement.  Consideration will be based on best value to Government, based on evaluation of factors listed here.  Anticipated award date is September 2007.  The products will be evaluated on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The award will be determined utilizing Best Value/trade off criteria.       
     Point of Contact is Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil
B. Products and Performance Required
   The Heartland Region is seeking product lines in the category of IV Infusion Pumps, Tubing and Supplies.  The yearly estimated total volume for IV Infusion Pumps, Tubing and Supplies is $303,766.66.  This is based on the historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period.  
  At the request of the Heartland Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brand, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.
C. Instructions to Offerors
DAPA holders who are interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) Point of Contact (Name and phone number, fax, email address, and Solicitation Number) to Phyllis Targett @ phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil   (937) 257-9075 before 4:00 P.M. EST on the date listed for closing on the FBO announcement in order to remain competitive.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.
This process will ultimately include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical/company criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Heartland Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before 4:00 P.M. EST on the date listed for closing on the FBO announcement in order to remain competitive.  Vendors that fail to meet the re-submittal deadline will be disqualified.    
D.  Evaluation Criteria
   The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTF?s in the Heartland Region.  They are the final decision makers for this initiative. 
Phase I.  Vendors will be required to the provide responses to the technical/company criteria.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the solicitation response will be eliminated from the standardization process.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will review the responses and determine acceptability.  After review of technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in Phase II, the clinical/performance evaluation.  All Technical/Company Criteria are equally weighted.
Phase II.  The TRBO will request product samples from the product group to be evaluated in a clinical setting at select MTF?s. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTF?s.  A three-week period will be allotted to vendors for shipment. Samples must be submitted by COB at 4PM local time, 21 calendar days after request. Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.     
    Specific MTF?s will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert like one to five rating scale ranging from one, which is equal to not acceptable and five, which is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance questions are equally weighted.  The CPT has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all product groups.  Clinical/performance results lower than a 3.75 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.
Phase III.  After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who meet the minimum 3.75 threshold will be invited to participate in Phase III, pricing evaluations.  All vendors will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTF?s in the Heartland Region.
     Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  Pricing will be evaluated based on the best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.

The distribution system is composed primarily of overhead, pole-type (conventional open wire) construction with pole-mounted transformer banks. There is also some underground primary construction, utilizing both direct burial and duct-type construction methods. Most of the commercial area is served from the overhead system, and a portion of the residential area is served from the underground system. The average electrical energy requirement for Fort Belvoir during FY 01 was 134,296 MWh. This Contract does not include the procurement of electricity and shall not affect the current electricity contract with Dominion Virginia Power.

Electrical Distribution System. Two DVP-owned 34.5 kV feeders supplies four (4) Government-owned 34.5 kV feeders for service on the main post. These feeders serve as both distribution supply circuits and as sub-transmission circuits that supply switching stations, and substations. The primary distribution system contains seventy-five (75) 4.16 kV, 12.5 kV, 22.9 kV and 34.5 kV circuits, most of which are configured with loop tie switches to neighboring circuits. The distribution system also contains sub-transmission substations, distribution substations, overhead primary and secondary distribution lines, and underground distribution lines. An order-of-magnitude inventory report below, containing estimated linear feet and other information for this electrical distribution system that has been developed by the Fort Belvoir Directorate of Installation Support. The sources of the information contained in these tables are derived from electric distribution system maps as of September 2001. This Inventory Report is provided to assist the Contractor, however the Government assumes no responsibility for any conclusions or interpretations made by the Contractor based on the information made available by the Government. A number of areas within the electric distribution system may require replacements, improvements, or upgrades to conform to commonly accepted industry standards and practices such as the National Electric Safety Code (NESC). In addition to these system corrections, other improvements will be required as the system has an average age of 20 years and reaches the end of its useful life.

Electrical System Point of Ownership Requirements. The Contractor shall assume ownership at the point of the DVP 34.5 kV feeders attachment in the Humphrey?s Substation.

Transmission Voltage / Demarcation Requirements. Transmission voltage shall be distributed throughout the Installation for transformation to a primary voltage of
34.5 kV, 22.9 kV, 12.5 kV and 4.16 kV. The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring proper distribution of primary voltage for final transformation to typical operating voltages of 120, 208, 240, 277 and 480 at single and three phase, 60 Hz for each building or facility served.  The Government shall assume responsibility at the service entrance (weather head typically) for all aerial services and up to and including the main breaker (disconnect or panel), within a building on the secondary side. The Contractor will be responsible for the underground secondary service from the pad-mounted transformer to the building service entrance. There are approximately 1,100 service locations within the Installation.

The Engineering Proving Grounds (EPG) and Humphrey?s Engineering Center (HEC) is not included as part of the Fort Belvoir Installation as defined for this Contract. Fort Belvoir does own and operate two ferrous sulfate sewage injection points. All sewage generated at Fort Belvoir is delivered to the Utility Company mains and then transported to a Fairfax County, Virginia wastewater treatment plant that is governed by the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors and managed by the Fairfax County Office of Waste Management. Fort Belvoir?s average total wastewater collection for FY01 was 1.27 MGD. This solicitation does not include the procurement of wastewater treatment and shall not affect the current wastewater treatment contract with Fairfax County Public Works.

Wastewater Collection System. The Fort Belvoir wastewater collection system is composed primarily of clay pipe with the remainder comprised of mixed concrete, cast iron, and asbestos pipes.  The pipe ranges in size from 24 inches to less than 4 inches with the most common size of 8 inches. An order-of-magnitude inventory report, containing estimated linear feet and other information for the wastewater collection system has been developed by the Fort Belvoir Directorate of Installation Support is shown in the following tables. The sources of the information contained in these tables are derived from wastewater system maps as of September 2001. This Inventory Report is provided to assist the Contractor, however the Government assumes no responsibility for any conclusions or interpretations made by the Contractor based on the information made available by the Government.  The wastewater collection system at Fort Belvoir is an older system. An analysis of the system prepared in 1996 shows that over 65 percent of the investment providing wastewater collection was built in the 1940s and another 7 percent were constructed in the 1950s. 

Service Laterals. The privatized wastewater collection system shall include service laterals. A service lateral is defined as the smaller-diameter (normally 6 inch or less) lines that connect each service building to the wastewater mains.

<DESC>The NHLBI is seeking small businesses with the capability to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC) for a new nine-year multicenter clinical trial, Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT).  SPRINT is a randomized, multicenter clinical trial testing the effects of intensive lowering of systolic blood pressure (SBP) on preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Approximately 7,500 participants will be randomized into either the lower SPB goal of <120 mmHg (intensive treatment group) or the standard SPB goal of <140 mmHg (control group).  Participants will be 55 years or older with SPB ??130 mmHg and at least one additional CVD risk factor.  Only two high risk groups will be excluded.  Those patients with diabetes and those who have had a stroke because they are the target groups of other ongoing NHLBI and NINDS trials that are testing a lower BP goal.  SPRINT will focus on three other high risk groups:  patients with clinical CVD other than stroke, patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD), and patients without clinical CVD who have other CVD risk factors such as low levels of HDL.  In SPRINT, there will be a subgroup of 3,500 people with stage 3 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2).  The primary composite endpoints will be CVD mortality and non-fatal MI, stroke, and heart failure.  Several secondary outcomes will be examined, such as markers of renal functioning in non-CKD participants, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness.  It is possible that the study may be expanded to include additional secondary clinical endpoints, or additional treatment strategies to achieve the standard and lower SBP treatment goals.

There will be a one year protocol development phase, followed by the recruitment of participants over a 2 year period.  Participants will be followed for a total of four to six years.  Post follow-up there will be a two year period for close out, analysis, reporting, and dissemination.  Data to be collected includes demographics, medical history, physical examinations, medications, results of clinical laboratory tests and electrocardiograms (ECGs), as well as psychosocial, economic, and lifestyle questionnaires and data.  SPRINT will include 4 to 6 Clinical Center Network (CCN) hubs, with approximately 30-45 clinical sites per hub, which will be solicited under a separate request for proposals (RFP).  Depending on the final number of CCN hubs and clinical sites, data is anticipated to be collected from 120 to 180 clinical sites, with each CCN hub enrolling a total of 1,250 to 1,875 participants.  In addition, it is anticipated that the CC will subcontract for services for the following additional components of SPRINT:  a Drug Distribution Center (DDC), an ECG Reading Center, and a Central Laboratory.

One or more substudies that enhance the scientific value of the parent trial may also be performed in this program.  Substudies may be conducted at all CCNs or at only a subset of the CCNs.  Substudies will be selected and designed by the Ancillary/Substudy Proposals Subcommittee (ASPS), which will be established by the SPRINT Steering Committee.  The Steering Committee (SC) will be composed of the CCN investigators, Coordinating Center representatives, NHLBI and NIDDK representatives, and other experts as needed.  The SC chair will be appointed by the NHLBI director.

The SPRINT Coordinating Center will: 

1)	be responsible for the statistical design of the study and provide biostatistical support for protocol development, including power and sample size calculations and simulations; for randomizing study subjects, for study monitoring, and for the management and analysis of study data;
2)	develop operational and analytical methodology; provide administrative guidance, oversight, and support for SPRINT as a whole;
3)	coordinate protocol writing activities, including protocol drafting and finalization; develop, design, and distribute study forms and a manual of operations; ensure that the provisions of the manual of operations are carried out by the CCNs and the clinical sites; 
4)	establish the Drug Distribution Center (DDC) and two core laboratories:  the Central Laboratory and the ECG Reading Center; the DDC will package, label, and dispense drugs according to the study protocol and will also monitor compliance and provide data to the CC for further analyses; the Central Laboratory will arrange for the analysis of blood and urinary measurements, provide interpretation of blood measurements, and collect and store blood samples for biomarker and DNA analysis; the ECG Reading Center will provide a central interpretation laboratory of resting ECG; core laboratories will be responsible for developing and distributing specific measurement procedures, timely data gathering, analysis under the leadership from the CC, and providing data to the CC for central analyses;
5)	maintain quality control at participating Clinical Center Networks (CCN), and monitor their performance status; promote interactions among the CCNs, coordinating study activities among the CCNs and core laboratories, and assuring uniformity of study activities at all sites; train CCNs and core laboratories in standardized protocol implementation and data collection; provide rapid feedback to the CCNs and core laboratories on the quality of data submitted and proposed corrections; conduct periodic visits to each CCN in order to monitor and assure high performance throughout the trial;
6)	make travel arrangements and reimbursement to the Steering Committee chair and to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) members; 
7)	coordinate, plan, make arrangements for, and participate in the meetings of the Steering Committee and its subcommittees and of the DSMB and other meetings related to the conduct of the overall trial;
8)	facilitate communications among all organizational study components during each phase of the trial, including the Protocol Review Committee (PRC), the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and trial-wide subcommittees, such as the ancillary/substudy, mortality/morbidity, operational, publications, and adherence subcommittees; prepare and distribute minutes and reports of the Steering Committee, Executive Committee, PRC, and DSMB meetings, ensuring the quality and accuracy of data collection and report content;
9)	establish and maintain a computer system, secure database, and software needed for the storage and analysis of study data (including blood samples and ECGs) collected from up to 120-180 separate clinical sites; also provide for the central interpretation of quality of life and costs data collected on subsamples of participants;
10)	develop and maintain a study web site for the distribution of SPRINT information, documents, and forms to the CCNs; develop and maintain a public web site that provides information about SPRINT for the lay public;
11)	prepare and distribute periodic technical and statistical reports to the participating CCNs, the project officer, the contracting officer, and others identified as key partners by the project officer;
12)	review, at least weekly, study plans, procedures, activities, and data to ensure the scientific validity and clinical relevance of the trial and the protection of human subject safety and privacy, addressing such issues as recruitment progress and certification of new clinical sites;
13)	monitor end point results, morbidity and mortality data, and adverse event reports for patterns of safety or toxicity that may warrant changes in the study; and
14)	design and implement a plan for study closeout, analysis, and dissemination, including final data collection, verification, analytical support for scientific writing groups,  publication of study results, and plans for the investigators?? dissemination of study results. 

The CC will frequently need to make complex and rapid decisions and assist the study leadership and the DSMB in their decision-making process. These decisions will often be based on medical information obtained from the clinics and developments in the scientific literature and other sources of information, such as the FDA.  Therefore, CC staff will need to be highly experienced, with strong medical and scientific qualifications and credibility, and have specialized experience relating to hypertension, clinical cardiology, and nephrology.  The CC must have biostatistical and information technology expertise, including the ability to analyze a large volume of physiologic, quality of life, economic, and medical morbidity and mortality data, and to develop and maintain a complex website and computer system.  CC staff must be experienced coordinating several long term, complex, large scale, multi-site clinical events trials lasting more than four years.  This experience should include managing subcontracts with a DDC or core laboratories.  The medical monitor for the CC should be board certified in internal medicine with substantial experience in the clinical management of hypertension, and have significant experience in large scale multi-site events clinical research trials.  The CC must develop highly productive working relationships with the CCNs, core laboratories, academic researchers, NHLBI Project Office, advisory groups (e.g., DSMB), and clinical sites.

It is anticipated that there will be approximately 4-6 CCN hubs with approximately 30-45 clinical sites per hub.  Clinical sites will be medical facilities or individual practices that will be involved in the evaluation, enrollment, and treatment of patients in the trial.  In addition, SPRINT will include a central Coordinating Center (CC) that will be solicited under a separate request for proposals (RFP).  Depending on the final number of CCN hubs and clinical sites, data is anticipated to be collected from 120 to 180 clinical sites, with each CCN hub enrolling a total of 1,250 to 1,875 participants.  It is anticipated that the CC will subcontract for services for the following additional components of SPRINT:  a Drug Distribution Center (DDC), an ECG Reading Center, and a Central Laboratory.

Each CCN will be responsible for timely recruitment and clinical care quality assurance activities in accordance with the SPRINT protocol.  Each CCN will develop an appropriate subcontract arrangement with each clinical site; it is anticipated that the trial will use a per capitation reimbursement model for all or nearly all of the clinical sites in the study.  In addition, the CCN will provide the networks' scientific leadership and operational management.  The clinical sites within the CCN will collect data at the local level in accordance with the study protocol and the manual of operations (MOP), and will coordinate each participant's hypertension treatment.

Each CCN will be responsible for recruiting a minimum of between 1,250 to 1,875  patients, including meeting study-wide goals for recruitment of women and specific minorities (African Americans, Hispanic, Native American, Asian), and for study-wide goals with regard to patients with cardiovascular disease and stage 3 CKD.  The CCN will have the primary responsibility for timely evaluation and correction of recruitment problems, including development and implementation of alternative strategies to achieve the stipulated goals, and funding the related activities.  It is anticipated that each CCN will conduct at least yearly site visits within its network of clinical sites to supervise recruitment activities and assure high quality performance. The CCN activities will be coordinated with the CC, and may include site visits conducted by the CC, along with other organizational components of the study, leading to certification of new sites, cessation of recruitment at existing sites, and appropriate follow-up of patients enrolled from sites whose recruitment is stopped.  Each CCN will closely collaborate with and assist the CC in implementation and standardization of the protocol within their network.  

One or more substudies that enhance the scientific value of the parent trial may also be performed in this program.  Substudies may be conducted at all CCNs or at only a subset of the CCNs.  Substudies will be selected and designed by the Ancillary/Substudy Proposals Subcommittee (ASPS), which will be established by the SPRINT Steering Committee.  The Steering Committee (SC) will be composed of the CCN investigators, Coordinating Center representatives, NHLBI and NIDDK representatives, and other experts as needed.  The SC chair will be appointed by the NHLBI director.

The SPRINT Clinical Center Network will: 

1.	propose and present to the Steering Committee a step treatment drug regimen for the blood pressure strategy and for background therapy (pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic); collaborate with other CCNs, the Coordinating Center (CC), other central units (DDC, core laboratories), and the Project Office in finalizing the protocol and the manual of procedures (MOP), which includes detailed intervention and measurement descriptions and staff training procedures;

The CCN will assist the CC, the study leadership, and the DSMB in their complex decision making process.  These decisions will often be based on medical information obtained from the clinics and developments in the scientific literature and other sources of information, such as the FDA.  Therefore, CCN staff will need to be highly experienced, with strong medical and scientific qualifications and credibility, and have experience relating to hypertension and internal medicine, or clinical cardiology or nephrology.  CCN staff must be experienced coordinating several long term, complex, large scale multi-site clinical events trials lasting more than four years.  This experience should include managing subcontracts with at least 30-45 clinical sites, and extensive specialty care of patients with hypertension.  The medical monitor for the CCN should be board certified in internal medicine with substantial experience in the clinical management of hypertension, and have significant experience in large scale multi-site events clinical research trials.  The CCN must develop highly productive working relationships with the CC, clinical sites, core laboratories, academic researchers, NHLBI Project Office, and advisory groups (e.g., PRC, DSMB).

<SUBJECT>A -- Notice of Program Delay
<DESC>In August 2007 the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) released a draft RFP with the intent to conduct a full and open competition for the development of a Common Avionics Display (CAD).  The CAD design would be modular, scalable and with an open architecture to enable commonality of major sub-components. 

Recent changes to the target platform programs have resulted in an approximate one year delay in the development schedule for the CAD program.  In order to most cost effectively address several avionic system upgrades by integrating them concurrently, the V-22 program has deferred installation of a CAD solution until Lot 17, fiscal year 2013.  The H-1 program has withdrawn from the CAD program due to higher immediate priorities. Consequently, plans for release of a CAD RFP are hereby delayed indefinitely.

The Forest Service intends to build a new building in this location with the proceeds from the sales of administrative site land.  Within the next 5-year period, the new office building will be constructed.  If a new rental building were considered, there would be substantial cost to the Government that could not be recovered through competition.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>Statement of Work-USCG Aviation Training Requirements 

1.0  Scope Of Work:  This Statement Of Work describes the vessel and personnel required to support U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Miami, FL.  The contractor will be responsible for providing and operating a vessel in support of the U.S. Coast Guard?s aviation training program.  Specifically, the contractor shall provide all necessary management, supervision, personnel, labor, materials, fuel, and equipment necessary for the vessel to support helicopter hoisting and fixed wing aerial delivery evolutions by Air Station aircraft. 

1.1  Background:  One of the Coast Guard?s primary missions is Search and Rescue.  In order for the Air Station to fulfill this mission, it is necessary to conduct helicopter hoists of equipment to/from underway vessels, helicopter delivery/recovery of rescue swimmers to/from the water, and fixed wing aerial delivery of dewatering pumps and other equipment to the water.  These skill sets require both initial and proficiency training for Coast Guard pilots and aircrews. This training requires small boat support.  The U.S. Coast Guard?s increased OPTEMPO and Homeland Security mission has reduced the availability of Coast Guard small boats and crews to provide support for required aviation training.  

1.2  Vessel Description:  The vessel shall be no smaller than 38 feet and no longer than 65 feet in length and shall have at least a 11 foot beam.  The maximum draft of the vessel shall not exceed 4 feet.  Gross vessel weight shall be a minimum of 10 tons. 

1.2.1  Other Characteristics:  The vessel must have an enclosed cabin large enough to accommodate the entire crew during transit.  The vessel must be capable of easily recovering personnel from the water.  The minimum required speed for the vessel is 0 knots or ?dead in the water?.  The vessel must be capable of maintaining 10 knots transit speed for a minimum of 3 hours; 15 knots for 3 hours desired.  The vessel must be capable of maintaining a heading of + / - 10 degrees at 5 knots while operating under a large helicopter producing 90 knots of rotor downwash in varying sea states and winds.  An extremely shallow draft vessel is undesirable due to drift characteristics when subjected to rotor downwash.  The vessel must have no permanent structures protruding higher than 20 feet above the water line which cannot be quickly stowed (e.g. antennas).

1.2.2  Required Deck Area:  The minimum deck area is 64 sq ft on the aft (fantail) portion of the vessel to allow two crew members to safely conduct operations.  The deck area must be free of all obstructions.

1.2.3  Vessel Equipment:  The vessel shall have, at a minimum, all equipment required by law including a fathometer, radar, VHF-FM multiple frequency capable 2 way marine radio with specified frequencies/channels (13, 16, 21, 22, 23, 81, 83) and minimum ranges (20 NM), a cell phone for secondary communications to the Air Station Miami Operations Center, GPS, and a long distance high beam search light. 

1.2.4  Safety Equipment:  The vessel shall be outfitted with a contractor furnished first aid kit and approved Type III personal flotation devices for crew and passengers.  Survival suits shall be provided, by the contractor, as needed for crew members allowing them to operate on the weather deck / under rotor downwash continuously in temperatures ranging from 5 degrees C. to 40 degrees C. (41 degrees F. to 105 degrees F.).  The contractor shall provide helmets, goggles, and grounding rods for use by crew members during helicopter hoisting operations.

1.2.5  Required Docking/Mooring Facilities:  The contractor will also be responsible for providing docking/mooring facilities for their vessel.  The vessel shall be located within a one hour transit time from the geographical areas of operation.

1.2.6  Vessel Maintenance:  The contractor shall operate and maintain the vessel, all equipment and systems in accordance with the original equipment manufacturer?s technical manuals and specifications, United States Coast Guard regulations, and any applicable federal, state, and / or local regulations.

1.3  Personnel:  All contractor personnel are required to be U. S. citizens or legal residents of the United States.

1.3.1  Point Of Contact:  The contractor shall provide a point of contact who shall be available to discuss work performed under this contract during the normal working day and periods of underway time.  The point of contact shall be able to read, write, and speak English fluently.

1.3.2  Crew:  Minimum vessel crew shall consist of a coxswain and two deckhands.  The crew shall be currently trained in rescue techniques and water survival.  Each of the crew members shall be capable of operating and maneuvering the vessel during helicopter hoist operations and for aerial delivery equipment pickup as well as any required rescue operations.

1.3.2.1  Coxswain:  The coxswain shall be licensed, at a minimum, for the size of the vessel being operated, including the carriage of six passengers, and shall be qualified in CPR.  

1.3.2.2  Deckhands: The deckhands shall be knowledgeable in shipboard operations, rigging for helicopter operations, and deck seamanship.

1.4  Operational Requirements / Sites:  The schedule required and the operating site is as follows:

1.4.1  Normal Schedule:  Typically the contractor will be required to provide services one day per week (usually on Tuesday).  Operations will typically be conducted for on scene periods of 3 hours commencing 1-2 hours prior to official sunset.  The Coast Guard will provide specific times for services a minimum of 24 hours in advance.  Additional training periods may be conducted more than once a week to accommodate surge training requirements on a schedule mutually agreed upon by the parties.

1.4.2  Area of Operations:  The area of operations will be the shoreline out to 15 nautical miles from one of the following inlets: Port Everglades, Bakers Haulover, Hillsboro Inlet or Government Cut.

<DESC>Amendment 02, Clarification 
Questions and Answers, 1 October 2007
Combined Synopsis/Solicitation H92222-07-R-1023


Section: Environmental Requirements
a) IS:  Operating Temperatures: -40 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit
Q: These are MIL-TEMP ranges. Components requested by this solicitation are mostly commercial graded; some industrial. Items specified suggest a -20 to 100 F operational range.?

A: 100 F is not sufficient; our craft exceed that temperature range on a daily basis in real world operating environments.  Recommend retaining the -40 to 140 Operating Temperature range.

b) IS: Workmanship Vibration Levels (30 min/axis, three axis)
Q: Industry standard implements 3 (three) min/axis.? Is 30 minutes correct?

 A: 30 minutes is correct.

c) IS: Random vibration levels (30 min/axis, three axes)
Q: Industry standard implements 3 (three) min/axis. A thirty minute period suggests a destructive test procedure, a degradation of the life expectancy of the system. Is 30 minutes correct?

A: 30 minutes is correct.
 
Section: Computing Specifications
Par. 2) "Removable (to allow for storage of classified information) dual SATA Hard Drives (160GB+) configured in RAID 1 configuration."
Q1: RAID 1 is mirror mode. Is 160GB+ total RAID-1 mode (which implies 80G each drive minimum), or 160GB minimum each drive (which implies minimum total system storage capacity of 320GB?

A: The requirement is 160GB or greater for each drive.

Q2: (160GB+)?
Being a Navigation -general purpose computer - Windows XP + Digital Nav SW + Charts + applications can comfortably exist within a 32G space, with margin.
References: 160GB is a cost driver in the flash drive world; a significant vibration/shock/thermal issue in the spinning-disk (moving
parts) world.
 
A: Our requirement is for removable SATA Hard Drives.  I was not under the impression that we were considering Flash Drives.  Regarding Drive Space Capacity, 32GB is not sufficient.

The current Digital Nautical Chart Catalog encompasses 29 CD's, representing nearly 22GB of data.  Windows XP Professional requires 1.5GB of disk space.  Additionally, disk space must be allocated for the Transas NaviSailor 3000I software, plus any other software applications such as the Digital Data Switch Software required for the GEN II Communications System, ViaSat V-Mail Software, and Image Capture Sofware.

32GB Drives SATA Hard are virtually non-existent any more.  40GB and 80GB SATA Hard Drives are available, but are very rare.  The average minimum SATA Hard Drive capacity seems to be at the 120GB and 160GB mark, mostly at 160GB mark.  As Hard Drive Capacities continue to increase, smaller capacity Hard Drives cease to exist.

Strongly recommend a minimum SATA Hard Drive capacity of at least 160GB or greater.
 
Software Requirements:
Par. 4) "Norton Ghost 10.0 or later version"
Q: Industry survey suggests Norton Ghost 10 supports data backup functions very well, but not bootable image backup/restore functions.
Industry suggests other (i.e Acronics) SW for data and image backup/restore, with supported bootable functions.

A: Our Automated Information Systems Departments already possess the Software Tools required to build bootable images and can perform data backup and restoration.  No additional Software Tools are required to perform these functions.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  technical competence, past performance, and price.  Technical competence and past performance, when combined, weighs more than price.  Offerors shall submit past performance information to include contract number, government agency point of contact and contact information, description of supplies/services provided, unit of issue, unit price, and extended price.  Past performance shall be current and shall not exceed three (3) fiscal years before posting date of the combined synopsis/solicitation on FBO.  
(b)	Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options for the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c)	A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time of acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
