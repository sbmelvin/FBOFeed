<SUBJECT>R -- HHS INITIATIVE TO ELIMINATE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN HEALTH
<SOLNBR>REFERENCE-NUMBER-03M000282
<RESPDATE>072903
<CONTACT>Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-4379, Fax 301-443-3849, Email cganey2@psc.gov
<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), (DHHS) through the Program Support Center has a twelve  (12) month simplified acqusition procurement described as follows: 



The goal of Healthy People 2010 is to eliminate health disparities among segments of the population, including differences that occur by gender, race or ethnicity, education or income, disability, geographic location, or sexual orientation.  

Thus, in support of the Healthy People 2010 goal of eliminating health disparities, the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary, Tommy Thompson, mandated the elimination of health disparities as a priority for HHS.  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), an agency within HHS, has a key role in assisting HHS  in strengthening its efforts in improving minority health and in eliminating health disparities by:

1.  	Increasing/expanding efforts to coordinate and integrate disparities activities in those individuals with or at risk for mental and/or addictive disorders;
2.	Developing actions and activities to address weaknesses and gaps identified in the HHS or SAMHSA work plan;
3. 	Identifying leadership opportunities for participation by the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, or  SAMHSA Administrator that highlight a particular health concern, disparities issue, or significant accomplishment on behalf of the Department; and
4.  	Assessing and tracking progress of the Initiative to ensure success.  

These activities must make significant and demonstrable impacts on the elimination of racial and ethnic disparities in six priority health issue areas of infant mortality, cancer screening and management, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and child/adult immunizations.  

In order to achieve the goals of the Initiative, the Secretary is requiring all the agencies of the Department, such as SAMHSA,  to join him in making a concerted effort to coordinate and integrate disparities throughout the Department; to identify weaknesses and gaps in providing services to the identified racial/ethnic populations; and to develop a means that will assure that Americans are receiving information about the disparity areas and are aware of the steps they can take to prevent or reduce disease and promote their own health.      

PURPOSE:

To analyze SAMSHA grant programs, contracts, and other relevant activities related to the racial/ethnic minority populations (previously specified) impacted by health disparities and to create Departmental reports.  The information gleaned from the various SAMHSA sources and White House Initiative reports should provide information to the Secretary and the White House on SAMHSA=s efforts in eliminating racial and ethnic disparities.  



All firms interested in being considered for this potential acquisition shall submit a written request for a copy of the solicitation to the above address by 3:00 PM  EST July 29, 2003. 
E-mail and fax are accepted.

The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:  (A) Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price.  An offer’s proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item to confirm the extended amount for each.  (B) Next, using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek performance information on the lowest priced offerors (usually, the lowest 3 quotes) based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.

Past performance regarding key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be rated as highly as past performance information for the principle offeror.  (C) In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFQ.  (D) If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have an exceptional performance risk rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.  Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.  (E) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of “very good” or lower.  In that event, the contracting officer shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.

<DESC>The Government desires to solicit comments to the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) provided under this synopsis.  All comments and requested information are to be submitted via electronic mail, and are due by 4:00 PM on 8 October 2003.  It is requested that interested parties provide the business size of their company.  Telephone and facsimile responses to this synopsis will not be accepted. On 24 July 2000, the Department of the Navy announced the Fleet Technical Support Center, Atlantic Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) as a candidate for a Commercial Activities study in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76.  The intent of the study is to determine the most efficient and cost effective method of providing research, analysis, and correction of the configuration and logistics elements of each ship/submarine under the command of the Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command in the Norfolk, Virginia area.  Limiting conditions for this acquisition include the need for the Service Provider to be fully capable of ensuring that each unit has the correct configuration and ILS support necessary to ensure operational and battle readiness.  The ILO is not limited to any one system or application.  The ILS is comprised of every system and piece of equipment on the ship including HM&E, ordnance, and Electronics.  ILO provides support and configuration analysis to the systems and ensures the configuration is accurately reflected in the shipboard database and the shore commands that support the ship.  The support also includes shipboard requirements for Maintenance Assistance Modules, On-Board repair parts, test equipment, technical manuals, planned maintenance system support, allowance pages, coordinated COSAL documentation, and other aspects of shipboard readiness. Accordingly, the Service Provider must be capable of gaining access to all ships/submarines and facilities requiring support, to include the ability to obtain all necessary security clearances.  The offeror determined to represent the best value to the Government will be compared to the Government’s proposal to perform the Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) Services.  The Government intends to negotiate a Firm-Fixed Price contract.  The resulting contract will be for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods.  NAICS 561990 applies.  Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www2.eps.gov.  NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under other than full and open competition to Modular Building Concepts, 12580 Stotler Court, Poway, CA  92064 under FAR 6.302-1.  This is a follow-on procurement for continued leasing of three (3) modular buildings currently in place at US Customs and Border Protection.  The trailers have been leased since 1998.  Item 0001 is one (1) each single trailer, size 12X60 located at Brown Field, San Diego, CA.  Item 0002 is one (1) double wide trailer, size 24X60 located at the Border Station in Campo, CA.  Item 0003 is one (1) triple wide trailer, size36X60 located at the Border Station in Temecula, CA.

Any interest or pricing received as a result of this synopsis will be evaluated to include costs already expended by the Government, along with any charges for installation and setup on new trailers (FOB Destination) and dismantling and removal of existing trailers.  This is not a request for quotation and no quotation document will be issued.  Interested contractors who believe that they can meet these requirements shall submit in writing their pricing structure via email by September 19, 2003.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Electron and Optical Physics Division, Photon Physics Group, has a requirement for a major upgrade to a grazing-incidence  extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) monochromator.  In 1991-1993, a grazing incidence beamline was designed and constructed at the NIST Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility (SURF III) storage ring.  The beamline operates from 4 nm to 40 nm and was constructed with the primary intent of measuring the reflectivity of multilayer mirrors for Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL).  This beamline is an important component in NIST's role in providing advanced EUV metrology to the nation.  U.S. industry has placed accuracy and precision demands on measurements that NIST cannot meet with the current system.  The purpose of this requirement is to improve significantly the accuracy and precision of the monochromator in the grazing incidence beamline.***The period of performance shall be 12 months from date of award.*** FOB is Destination.***This requirement is being procured using full and open competition.***A fixed-price contract is anticipated.***The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.***The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), RFP amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ under RFP number SB1341-03-R-0026.***Potential offerors are advised that a SITE VISIT will be conducted.

<DESC>The pre-solicitation announcement for this RFP No. 03-SP-30-0101, issued July 15, 2003, is amended as follows: The procurement method is changed from the standard submission of competitive proposals to two-phase design-build selection procedures, in accordance with FAR Subpart 36.3. For Phase 1, Reclamation will issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) in the form of an electronic document, which will include the scope of work and evaluation factors for Phases One and Two. Offerors will be asked to submit a proposal which will be evaluated utilizing the Phase One factors, such as project understanding, technical qualifications, and past performance of the offeror's team (including the design and construction members). After evaluating the Phase One proposals, the contracting officer will select the most highly qualified offerors (not to exceed 5) and only those offerors will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. Reclamation will then issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) in the form of an electronic solicitation prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15. The short-list offerors will be asked to submit a technical and price proposal, which will be evaluated utilizing FAR Part 15 negotiation procedures in conjunction with the Best Value Trade-off process. Offers will be evaluated on factors such as the quality of the proposed approach to the work, management approach, and price. The estimated issuance date of the RFQ is on or about September 15, 2003, and the anticipated due date for Phase One proposals will be 21 days thereafter. The estimated issuance date of the RFP is on or about October 31, 2003, and the anticipated due date for Phase Two proposals will be 30 days thereafter. All dates in this announcement are estimates and are subject to change. The actual dates will be included in the issued documents.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-15.

***The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible Contractors may submit a quote.

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has a requirement for an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) Scanning Head and Controller meeting or exceeding the following specifications:

(1) A stand-alone AFM scanner, electronic controller, and computer with software.  The AFM must be compatible with operation in a working SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope), with minimal mutual degradation in performance.  For example, electromagnetic fields from the AFM must be minimized so that SEM resolution is not strongly degraded.  Quoters should either document operation of the AFM in an SEM and provide data on the SEM performance (including resolution) with and without AFM; or provide sufficient design data on the AFM to allow the stay electromagnetic fields generated by the AFM to be estimated.

(2) The AFM scanner shall have a lateral imaging range of at least 50 micrometers by 50 
micrometers, and a vertical range of at least 3 micrometers. Resolution of the X and Y axes should be at least 0.01 % of the maximum range or 5 nm, whichever is less, and Z axis resolution should be at least 0.01% of the maximum range or 0.3 nm, whichever is less;

(3) The AFM scanner shall be capable of measuring topographic features of a sample using contact and non-contact (dynamic or intermittent contact) mode.  It shall be capable of sampling other sample properties, in particular the electrostatic force when using a conductive AFM probe that is biased up to plus or minus 10 Volts relative to a sample.  It must also accept probes able to perform indentation and scratch experiments;

(4) The instrument must operate in atmosphere and be compatible for vacuum operation at pressures of one microtorr or less;

(5) The AFM must image a sample while the SEM scans the AFM.  This requires the pole piece of the SEM to approach within 12 mm of the AFM tip as defined below.  Therefore the unobstructed volume around the scanning tip must be large enough that a plane can approach to within 12 mm of the probe tip while the AFM scans a sample.  The point on the plane closest to the AFM probe tip must have an unobstructed view of the contact point between the probe and sample, and the line of sight to the probe tip must be perpendicular to the plane.  The AFM must also operate with the line of sight to the SEM vertical. 

(6) The resonant frequency of the scanner must be above 3kHz, and the thermal drift must be less than 5 nm/minute;

(7) For operation using optical beam deflection, the control electronics must operate with a 4-quadrant photo-sensor, and measure normal force as well as lateral force.  Operation using piezo cantilevers is also acceptable if all other requirements are met.  The control electronics must also perform measurements of force/distance curves, and allow for monitoring and/or modifying sensor and actuator input/output signals between the control unit and the AFM scanner. It must also be possible to use an external lock-in amplifier for non-contact mode imaging;

(8) The AFM must be small enough to be mounted within a volume 100 mm square by 40 mm high, with the probe tip centered on a point less than 25mm from the center of the 100 mm square area.

*** DELIVERY SHALL BE FOB DESTINATION.  Delivery shall be completed not later than 120 days from the date of award.

***FOB Destination means the Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  

***Award shall be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price.  Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price.

*** Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Quoters shall include the make and model of the product, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which clearly documents that the offered product meets or exceeds the specifications stated above.  In evaluating technical capability that exceeds specifications, greatest consideration will be given to the following, in descending order of importance: (1) Performance of the AFM and SEM during simultaneous operation; (2) Minimum distance from the SEM pole piece to the AFM probe tip; (3) Scan performance (such as range, resolution, and ability to sample other properties); (4) Capabilities of the control electronics and software.

Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or information provided by NIST or its' affiliates.  Quoters shall provide a list of at least THREE (3) REFERENCES to whom the same or similar products have been sold.  The list of references shall include, at a minimum: The name of the reference contact person and the company or organization; the telephone number of the reference contact person; the contract or grant number; the amount of the contract and the address and the telephone number of the Contracting Officer if applicable; and the date of delivery or the date services were completed. Past Performance shall be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and service provided by the Contractor.  Quoters with no relevant past performance shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.
