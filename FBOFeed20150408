This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) has a requirement to conduct phase one of the Mining Industry Surveillance System in the Stone / Sand and Gravel mining sector. There are three sampling phases planned for three subsequent years. This contract only includes the tasks to conduct phase one of the survey in the stone, sand and gravel mining sector. An important objective of the survey will be to obtain "denominator data" so that the Mine Accident, Injury and Illness Reports, MSHA Form 7000-1, can be evaluated in relation to the population at risk. Currently, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) collects demographic and occupational information only for injured or ill miners. As a consequence, the accident data cannot be fully exploited to study the employee-level correlates of mining accidents. Another survey objective is to obtain data that can be used to understand the demographic characteristics of the mining workforce. An additional objective will be to collect information about the mining operations, such as work schedules and the use of independent contractor labor. A firm fixed price contract award is intended. Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 2015-N-16900 will be issued on an unrestricted basis to full and open competition. The solicitation will be issued on or about April&nbsp;22, 2015. Proposals will be due on or about May&nbsp;22, 2015. Organizations interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation may submit a written request to DHHS/PHS/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NIOSH-Pittsburgh, Office of Acquisition Services - Branch 4, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236.

<SUBJECT>A--Mobile Medium Enegry Non-Instrusive Inspection (NII) Technology Modernization
<SOLNBR>D15PS00350
<RESPDATE>041715
<ARCHDATE>05172015
<CONTACT>Susanne_Lang@ibc.doi.gov
<DESC>CBP Officers and Border Patrol Agents, in the course of their work, examine conveyances and cargo. These inspections take place at controlled Ports of Entry (POE) and Border Patrol checkpoints, and are aimed at detecting items prohibited from import into or export from the U.S.  Each day CBP Officers and Border Patrol Agents use a variety of Large Scale Non-Intrusive Inspection (LS-NII) systems. LS-NII systems in the mobile configuration allow CBP to quickly move operations to different locations, based on the threat.
The LS-NII mobile medium energy imaging systems have been in operation for 8-10 plus years and are reaching the end of their predicted life cycle.  Continued use of these systems in their present condition will increase Operation & Maintenance (O&M) costs and result in unacceptable performance levels; ultimately in decreased detection limits and higher false alarms.  Based on the projected acquisition of new systems the mobile medium energy imaging fleet will be required to operate well beyond its 10 year life cycle.  Realizing these boundaries, the goal of this effort is to modernize the mobile medium energy equipment by replacing a limited number of subsystems to improve imaging performance and reliability at a significant cost savings over replacing the entire system.  The Statement of Work (SOW) for this effort will define the tasks necessary to upgrade the imaging subsystems of a LS-NII mobile medium energy system to include program management, concept definition/validation, prototype fabrication/testing and Limited Rate Initial Production (LRIP) for up to five systems to be used for field evaluation.  It is noted that this SOW will not address the mobile/mechanical aspects of the system.
The scope of this effort is a Research and Development (R&D) Program to modernize US Customs & Border Protections (CBP) Large Scale Non-Intrusive Inspection (LS-NII) mid-energy radiography equipment.  CBP has an aging fleet of LS-NII equipment with rapidly diminishing performance characteristics and increasing Operation & Maintenance (O&M) costs.  The goal of this modernization would be to extend the service life, enhance the sustainability, and improve the imaging performance of the existing fleet equipment.
It will be the Contractors responsibility to: (a) design a solution that will replace a limited number of subsystems and improve imaging performance and reliability at a significant cost savings to replacing the entire system; (b) demonstrate that the technical approach will work in a laboratory environment/proof of concept; (c) develop a prototype that can be integrated in an actual system; (d) conduct an initial field evaluation of prototype system; (e) integrate and install up to five upgrade kits; and, (f) provide operations and maintenance support for a field evaluation at Ports of Entry (POEs) within the continental United States for a period of up to 12 months.  The Statement of Work (SOW) will define the tasks necessary to upgrade the imaging subsystems of a LS-NII mobile medium energy system including: program management, concept definition/validation, prototype fabrication/testing and LRIP and support for up to 5 units.  
The primary requirements/specifications, which the Contractor shall specifically address to improve upon performance and extend the system life cycle are the following upgrade specifications:
	Inherent Availability 	Operational Environment 	Maximum Penetration 	Horizontal and Vertical Spatial Resolution 	Contrast Sensitivity 	Image Resolution 	Radiation Exclusion Zone 	Scan Speed 	Average Throughput
The Request for Proposal (RFP) will contain a baseline R&D effort with several options for additional testing, LRIP, and support for the LRIP evaluation period.  The notional  period of performance for this effort will be 38 months.
This project is under the technical direction of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science & Technology (S&T) Directorate, Border and Maritime Security Division (BMD) and the U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Office of Information and Technology (OIT), Laboratories and Scientific Services Division (LSS), and the Interdiction Technology Branch (ITB) in consultation with the Office of Field Operations (OFO).

<DESC><p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). NHTSA's mission is to save lives, prevent injuries and reduce traffic-related health care and other economic costs. The agency develops, promotes and implements effective educational, engineering and enforcement programs with the goal of ending preventable tragedies and reducing economic costs associated with vehicle use and highway travel. Current data is essential to develop future approaches to improve traffic safety. Pursuant to 23 U.S.C. &sect; 403, NHTSA is authorized to collect data and develop programs appropriate for highway traffic safety.<br /><br />According to the nationwide seat belt use surveys over the last 5 years, the average seat belt use rate has remained relatively constant at 87 percent, with the use rate having made a notable increase from 84 percent in 2011 to 86 percent in 2012, as measured by NHTSA's National Occupant Protection Use Survey (NOPUS).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NOPUS is a national probability-based survey, which is independent from State belt use surveys.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While this use rate is commendable, the percent of vehicle occupants killed in traffic crashes that are unrestrained remains near 50 percent nationally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span><br />High unrestrained-fatality rates persist nationwide and in some States are as high as 70 percent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A recent review of data shows that a disproportionate number of unrestrained occupants are killed in motor vehicle crashes in States with seat belt use rates at or above the national seat belt use rate of 86 percent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The argument or assumption could be made that when use rates are high, the number of unrestrained fatalities should be proportionately low; instead the figures do not follow this logic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in 2012, there were 21,667 occupants of passenger vehicles (passenger cars, pickup trucks, vans, and SUVs) who died in motor vehicle traffic crashes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Looking only at occupants where the restraint status was known, 52 percent were unrestrained at the time of the crashes. The data also indicates that a larger percentage of the unrestrained fatalities occurred at night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /></span><br />According to research, the use of a seat belt is 45 percent effective in reducing the likelihood of death in a motor vehicle crash; great gains are yet to be achieved and thousands of lives saved by increasing the seat belt use rate throughout the country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The implementation of a multi-faceted, technical assistance project that includes a variety of strategies such as enforcement, education, awareness, earned media, and the use of highly-visible seat belt observations, and the dissemination of the observation results may serve as a means for increasing seat belt use and reducing unrestrained fatalities.<br /><span style="COLOR: black"><br />NHTSA seeks a Contractor to procure professional and technical services to research methods to increase seat belt use &amp; reduce unbelted crash fatalities and injuries via a technical assistance project for law enforcement and community stakeholders.<br /></span><br />This acquisition is being offered as a SET-ASIDE FOR (8A) COMPETITION ONLY.

<DESC>Solicitation Number: <br />AB-133F-15-RQ-0023<br />Notice Type: <br />Pre-Solicitation Notice
<p>Synopsis: <br />The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), has a requirement for a vessel charter for the Biennial Bottom Trawl Surveys of Alaskan Groundfish in the Gulf of Alaska, Continental Slope of the Eastern Bering Sea, and Midwater and Pelagic surveys of the Northeastern Bering Sea.<br /><br />AFSC requires one (1) commercial stern trawler with experienced crew to execute stock assessment bottom trawl surveys of groundfish in the Gulf of Alaska in odd years (2015, 2017, and 2019) and in even years (2016 and 2018) to execute stock assessment bottom trawl surveys of the upper continental slope of the Eastern Bering Sea and to conduct midwater and surface trawls to investigate the impact of loss of sea ice on the marine ecosystem of the Northeastern Bering Sea.  The vessel will need to be completely rigged for trawling with a stern ramp and gallows or gantry, two net reels each with capacity for a four-seam Poly Nor'Eastern bottom trawl and a Cantrawl model 400/580 hexagonal mesh trawl, as well as be equipped with modern navigation, fish-finding, and communications electronics.  AFSC will provide the trawls, bridles, and trawl doors.  The bottom trawl survey areas comprise stations at depths that range 10 up to 1,200 m (6-660 fm) requiring the vessel to have split trawl winches with a minimum of 1,463 m (800 fm) of 2.53 cm- (1 in-) diameter steel core trawl cable in good condition and available for fishing on each drum (not total capacity) but a preference for vessels having 1,830 m (1,000 fm) or more of 2.53 cm- (1 in-) diameter steel core trawl cable or more available for fishing on each drum (not total capacity) to ensure complete coverage of the deeper sites in the bottom trawl survey areas.  An experienced skipper and a four-member fishing crew will be needed to operate the vessel and the fishing gear, while a team of six scientists will direct survey operations. The Gulf of Alaska survey operations span 75 days and will be conducted from mid-May to late July where approximately 280 tows will be conducted by each of three (3) vessels - this vessel included - in conducting the fishery survey.  On alternate years, this vessel will be used separately to conduct the Eastern Bering Sea upper continental slope bottom trawl survey, completing approximately 200 tows over a 55-day period during early June to early August, followed by survey operations in the Northeastern Bering Sea comprising a series of midwater and surface trawls over 25 days at 156 established sites to investigate the ecological impact of loss of sea ice.<br />Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, transportation and services necessary to perform the requirements for the Biennial Continental Slope Bottom Trawl Survey of Groundfish Resources in the Eastern Bering Sea, except as noted in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>The resulting firm-fixed-price (with reimbursable line items for communications and moorage with an optional line for Government Property Transport) contract will have a base period of performance and four option periods.  The yearly charter will occur from approximately mid-May to mid-August each year, depending on the survey required, for up to 75 charter days.  Currently, fuel is planned to be provided by the Government via Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) contract.  Should the DLA not be available, then fuel shall be reimbursed at cost.<br /><br />The proposed contract will be FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. The NAICS code for this procurement is 483114 and the size standard is 500 employees. All responsible and fully responsive sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. Any resulting contract will be awarded as a firm-fixed price contract. Solicitation documents will be made available for download on or about December 19, 2014 at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) intends to solicit and negotiate, on a sole source basis, a contract modification to an existing order under the Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-12-G-0006 Class Justification and Approval (CJ and A) with the Bell Boeing Joint Project Office (BB JPO) located in Amarillo, TX under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  

The United States Marine Corps (USMC) and Air Force have identified a requirement to integrate the 20.1.01/20.2.01 and 10.5.0X /20.3.0X  software, which is developed under the V-22 Avionics and Flight Controls System Engineering and Software Maintenance Support contract, into CV-22 Flight Training Devices and integrate Block C software, which is developed under the V-22 Avionics and Flight Controls System Engineering and Software Maintenance Support contract, into MV-22 Flight Training Devices in order to comply with training requirements and to maintain concurrency with Fleet aircraft.
  

BB JPO, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the of the MV-22 and CV-22 aircraft platform and all MV-22 and CV-22 flight training devices procured to date, is the only responsible source capable of upgrading the current flight training devices to the aircraft configurations, 20.1.01/20.2.01 and 10.5.0X /20.3.0X  software respectively.  Concurrent training prior to delivery of the new aircraft configurations is essential for fleet readiness to support operations overseas and reduce aircraft operating costs associated with using the aircraft for training. As such, it is not possible for any other source to upgrade the existing training devices to the new configurations.

This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.
  Interested sources desiring to contest this synopsis may do so by asserting its supportable rationale via email to Erin Young, erin.b.young@navy.mil in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2007, no later than 23 April 2015 at 1300 EST. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  No solicitation document is available.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6 SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND QUOTATIONS ARE HEREBY BEING REQUESTED. A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  This solicitation number is RFQ-RT-15-00037 and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% small business set-aside Request for Quotation (RFQ) using FAR Part 12 Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-55, effective February 2, 2012.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number 541380, Testing Laboratories, applies to this requirement and the small business size standard is $14M.  A firm fixed-pri ce contract is anticipated to result from award of this solicitation.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina has a requirement to Rank of 100 Chemicals for Reactivity Using Electrophilic Index to Estimate Relative Rates of Adduct Reactions.  The Government invites contractors with the capability to provide services capable of linking predictable chemical reactivity-based protein adduct formation to a variety of target organ toxicities: Development of putative adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) to submit an offer. A. SCOPE: Statement of Work: Rank 100 Chemicals for Reactivity Using Electrophilic Index to Estimate Relative Rates of Adduct Reactions.  a. BACKGROUND INFORMATION - Project Title: Linking predictable chemical reactivity-based protein adduct formation to a variety of target organ toxicities: Development of Putativ e Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs).  SCOPE - Many environmental chemicals produce toxic responses through non-receptor mediated actions with endogenous proteins or other biological macromolecules. The volume of chemicals present in the ambient environment necessitates a method for quantifying and predicting corresponding toxic potential. Considerations of structure-activity relationships are often used to screen and make decisions regarding chemicals with little or no toxicity data. The chemical interactions of certain toxicants with their biological targets have been described and predicted by parameters derived from quantum mechanical calculations such as softness (&#963;), hardness (&#951;) and electrophilicity (&#969;). These descriptors are based on the Hard and Soft, Acids and Bases (HSAB) theory of Pearson, and have been applied to mechanistic studies of chemicals that produce central-peripheral distal axonopathies. It has also been realized that the HSAB theory could  be applied to a broader spectrum of chemical toxicants that produce other forms of toxicity, e.g., reproductive toxicity.  The main HSAB hypothesis is that chemicals are toxic because they form covalent adducts (react) with, and consequently deactivate, macromolecules that are important in biological processes. The toxic potency of the compound is related to the rate of the adduct-forming reactions. When polarizability (relative distribution of electrons between the specific atoms within a molecule; viz., polarizable or soft vs. non-polarizable or hard) is combined with a measure of chemical reactivity (strong vs. weak, tendency to react with other chemicals), the resulting parameter (electrophilicity) exhibits quantitative correspondence to the rate of adduct formation and hence, the toxicity. These HSAB predictions are quantitative, and amenable to empirical testing in laboratory settings.  The overall approach in this project is to use HSAB molecular descriptors to develo p a list of environmentally relevant chemicals (and in some cases corresponding metabolites) ranked by their potency to produce adducts that may result in neuro- and/or reproductive toxicity. Subsequent laboratory verification of these predictions for a subset of these chemicals expand the HSAB theory to include different chemical classes and types of toxicities.  An additional outcome is the development of a testable Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) for these processes. Identification of key events will allow assays to be developed, with the eventual goal of porting to a High Throughput Screening (HTS) format, thereby increasing the biological space covered by EPA?s HTS efforts. An additional result will be the demonstration of how a common Molecular Initiating Event (MIE) can be involved in multiple types of toxicity. Such information can inform predive models that can be used by EPA for screening chemicals using only structural features. Success in this effort will allow exp ansion of the HSAB theory and development of AOPs for additional types of toxicity, increasing the value of EPA's toxicity screening programs.  b. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: This statement of work will describe the process by which the contractor will rank 100 chemicals for their potential potency to produce hard or soft protein adducts in biological tissue.  The US EPA will provide a list of chemicals that are of interest to EPA and the CSS research program. Using the supplied list and the chemical literature, the HSAB modeling expert will perform the structural analysis necessary to develop HSAB parameters (softness, hardness and electrophilicity) for each substance using quantum mechanical models. The calculated values will be used to predict the MIE (protein adducts), and the specific protein adducts will be used to predict associated AOPs. This work is expected to provide a sufficient range of chemicals from which selections can be made for hypothesis-testing in future wor k.  The Contractor will also develop plans for quality assurance and a cost estimate and time line for delivering the chemical rankings.  Following EPA approval of the Contractor-submitted plan, the EPA will provide a list of selected chemicals to the contractor within two months. c. CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS: General Overview - The Contractor shall perform the following tasks, which are detailed below: 1 - Provide a quality assurance plan that specifies how the tasks will be completed and documented; 2 - Perform HSAB analysis and rank chemicals (based on softness, hardness and electrophilicity) that are provided by the EPA; 3 - Provide EPA with output of HSAB analysis, including a list of chemicals ranked for reactivity in terms of potency; and 4 - Discuss with EPA the strengths/limitations of the rankings and any confidence limits for the HSAB predictions and rankings. Tasks to be Completed by the Contractor: Task 1 -  Demonstrate QA/QC Compliance.  Prior to award, the Contr actor shall provide a Quality Management Plan (QMP) based upon EPA requirements R-2, as described in http://www.epa.gov/quality/qa_docs.html#noneparqt.   After award, the Contractor shall provide a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP), in accordance with requirements R-5, as described in http://www.epa.gov/quality/qa_docs.html#noneparqt. This plan shall describe (a) the methods by which the HSAB ranking will be performed, (b) any known caveats regarding the proposed HSAB methods for the chemicals on the list provided by EPA, and (c) how these actions will be documented and how the documentation will be provided to the EPA. This QAPP shall be provided within 30 business days after award of the contract, and must be approved by the EPA before work can begin.  Task 2. Perform HSAB analysis ranking.  EPA will provide a list of 100 chemicals that are of interest to EPA and the CSS research program. Using the supplied list and the chemical literature, the HSAB modeling expert wil l perform the organic structural analysis necessary to chemically classify each substance (hard/soft, electrophile/nucleophile). Values for HSAB parameters (softness, hardness and electrophilicity) of relevant substances will then be calculated using quantum mechanical models. The calculated values will be used to provide a ranking for the likelihood of binding to different types of biological proteins.  Task 3. Delivery of HSAB analysis ranking.  The contractor will provide the EPA with a ranking based on the HSAB parameters (electrophilic, nucleophilic index, softness, hardness) for each of the 100 chemicals. Predicted protein residues that are likely sites of reaction by the chemical shall be included where possible. For this effort, the contractor will focus on the nervous and reproductive systems in rodents.  d. GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES.  The EPA will provide a decision to the Contractor regarding approval or request for changes of the QAPP within 15 business days af ter receipt of the QAPP.  The EPA will provide the initial list of 100 chemicals for HSAB characterization. The contractor can suggest additional chemicals (or metabolites) that may be of interest to the EPA. After discussion, the EPA may modify the final list, keeping a total of 100 chemicals.  The period of performance for this contract shall remain active through the completion of production and delivery of the ranked list of chemicals, but no longer than six months after award of the contract.  e. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS - The Contractor shall provide the information about all software packages that were used to perform the HSAB analysis and generate the final ranked list of chemicals, their HSAB parameter values, and quality control procedures. The general procedure shall be provided to the EPA, in sufficient detail such that an independent expert should be able to replicate the results. The EPA will consider other reporting options proposed by the Contractor.  f. SCHEDU LE OF DELIVERABLES - The EPA proposes the following schedule of deliverables: 1. Completion of Task 1: 1 month after award of contract; 2. Completion of Task 2: 5 months after award of contract; 3. Completion of Task 3: 6 months after award of contract.  The schedule for completion of Tasks 2 - 3 can be negotiated with the EPA prior to award of the contract, if the Contractor believes that it is either not attainable or can be accelerated. However, once a schedule has been agreed to by both the Contractor and the EPA, then the Contractor shall adhere to the schedule unless changes are authorized by the EPA. If changes are not authorized by the EPA and the Contractor fails to meet the scheduled delivery dates, then the dollar amount of the final payment will be reduced by 10% of the amount remaining in the contract per month of delay. The amount remaining in the contract shall be determined at the time at which completion of the task was scheduled to occur. B. PROVISIONS ?

<a href="mailto:beverly.chin@gsa.gov">Email</a>
<DESC>Project Summary:  The General Service Administration (GSA) plans to reconfigure and expand in two phases the existing Calexico West Port of Entry (POE) in Calexico, CA.  The Phase 1 project is the subject of this Fed Biz Opp (FBO) Notice.  The award of this contract is subject to the availability of funds. 

The Calexico West Land Port of Entry (LPOE) is one of the busiest crossing points between the United States and Mexico.  It handles approximately 20,000 pedestrian and 17,000 to 20,000 privately owned vehicle (POV) border crossings every day of the week.  Construction of the Phase 1 project will not interfere with the current 24 hours/ 7 days a week operation of the LPOE.  The existing ten (10) primary vehicle inspection and sixteen (16) secondary vehicle inspection booths, located at the existing Main Administration building, will remain operational during the Phase 1 new construction.  The existing pedestrian crossing facility will not be affected during the Phase 1 project.

The Phase 1 project will expand the existing LPOE to accommodate increasing volumes of POV for north and south bound traffic.  The Phase 1 construction will occur on the decommissioned Commercial Port site west of the existing port and the railroad track.  This area is sloped, dropping approximately 30 feet in elevation from Northeast to the Southwest, bordering the New River.  The Phase 1 project will encompass land fill in this area to support the construction of a new Head House, vehicle canopies, walkways, roadways and traffic lanes.  Additionally, Phase 1 includes surface vehicular parking, and primary and secondary canopies for northbound POV inspection, POV primary inspection booths for 10 new north bound lanes, a new temporary southbound inspection area, and a three lane south bound bridge over the New River all west of the existing port.  There are no commercial truck facilities at the Calexico West LPOE.  

The cost of construction is estimated in the range of $80,000,000 to $85,000,000.  

The period of performance for the Phase 1 project is estimated to be thirty (30) months after the issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP) by the GSA Contracting Officer.  

Acquisition Strategy:  This is a competitive acquisition source selection using the best-value trade-off process to award a firm fixed price contract.  This procurement will be advertised for Full & Open Competition. This source selection is based on FAR Part 15 and GSAM.  The evaluation process will result in selection of the proposal that represents the best value for the Government in terms of technical and price factors as identified in the solicitation and in accordance with FAR Part 15.3.

RFP Requests:  Contractors are to submit a written request for a copy of the RFP to:  Beverly Chin, GSA, PBS, Acquisition Management Division (9PQ2CP), 50 United Nations Plaza, First Floor West, Room 1298, San Francisco, CA  94102.  Requests may be mailed or e-mailed:  beverly.chin@gsa.gov.  Refer to RFP No. GS-09P-15-KT-C-7000.

<DESC>Snatch Block <br> US Army RDECOM-TARDEC Market Survey <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: <br> THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation documents exist at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered. <br>  <br> OBJECTIVE: <br> The US Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) Center for Systems Integration (CSI) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources and the status of innovative designs for winch line/snatch block recovery of military vehicles.  TARDEC is requesting a detailed breakdown of the snatch block (or related item) designs, to include estimated costs, performance, and timing. The intent of the market survey is to gather information to assess the readiness of potential designs.  <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION: <br> The goal of this Request for Information is to identify potential sources, and the status of innovative designs that prevent damage to the synthetic rope when used with a snatch block. The current snatch blocks were designed for stiff wire rope and do not prevent more flexible synthetic winch rope from jumping off the sheave groove and being pulled across the sharp edge of the block if the line momentarily goes slack during a recovery. When this occurs, both the rope and the block are damaged (See appendix A for photos of damage and rope information). There are two snatch blocks currently being used on the vehicle: <br>  	Part quote mark 109251 quote mark   McKissick block rated for 8 tons (with 4:1 safety factor), weight ~ 30 lbs  <br>  	Part  quote mark 8383238 quote mark   rated for 15 tons (w 4:1 safety factor), weight 85 lbs, 10 quote mark  sheave,   quote mark  rope <br>  <br> A solution could consist of an add-on to the existing snatch blocks (measurements available from emily.a.neville2.civ@mail.mil), new blocks with self-contained solutions, or new blocks with an add-on solution.  <br>  <br> The ideal solution would be to replace the two different snatch blocks with two of the same snatch block, rated for at least 15 tons (with 4:1 safety factor), each with a solution that allows the snatch block to handle angles between approximately 30  and 180  (see Appendix B), each assembly weighing less than 40 lbs. To handle varying angles, the solution may be adjustable or removable. <br>  <br> This equipment will be used with a 30,000 lb single line rated pull winch. Any load bearing component must have at least a 2:1 safety factor for the loads it will experience; i.e. a snatch block must have a minimum breaking strength (MBS) of at least 120,000 lbs in order to withstand the 60,000 lbs it will experience when used in a double line (180 ) pull from a 30,000 lb rated winch. The snatch block must be suitable for   quote mark  diameter synthetic rope.  <br>  <br> Please provide a CAD model and/or drawing that describes the breaking strength, weight, size, and significant design features of the snatch block or other design solution, along with test results and the unit cost. If a solution has been designed but not yet tested, provide an analysis of expected performance characteristics and a description of the recommended test method.  <br>  <br> RESPONSES: <br> Responses shall include four items (at a minimum):  <br> 1.	3D Models in Pro/E format or a step file preferred; 2D drawings with package dimensions at a minimum <br> 2.	Description or illustration of the feature/s that prevent damage to the synthetic rope <br> 3.	Unit cost and any volume discounts that may be offered <br> 4.	Test or analysis results showing minimum breaking strength and other relevant characteristics <br>  <br> Responses are requested no later than 30 days after announcement post. The Government will begin analysis in the short term following the 30 day submission period. Please address any questions regarding this market survey via email to emily.a.neville2.civ@mail.mil.  Include in the Subject line  quote mark Snatch Block Market Survey quote mark , and provide your name, phone number and email address in the body of the email to ensure a timely response.  Responses will be furnished via e-mail or phone.  <br>  <br> Submit unclassified responses to emily.a.neville2.civ@mail.mil. Do not respond with any classified data to this email address.    <br>  <br>   <br> Participation in this market survey is completely voluntary. If the Government seeks additional information that is not included in a submittal, TARDEC representatives may contact the participant for further information exchange. Vendor teaming is permitted, but not required.  Information developed as part of this market survey may be shared with US Army Research, Development Engineering Command (RDECOM) subordinate commands and Other Government Agencies (OGAs) (i.e. Office of Naval Research, Marine Corps, Army, Project Management offices, etc.). <br>  <br> GENERAL INFORMATION:  <br> The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as  quote mark confidential quote mark  under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term  quote mark confidential quote mark  in the context of Classified Information, quote mark  we will use the term  quote mark PROPRIETARY. quote mark ] Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <br>  <br> 1.	Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps)  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br>  <br> 2.	In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected. <br>  <br> 3.	The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data. <br>  <br> 4.	Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS: quote mark  and  quote mark PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS. quote mark  <br>  <br> 5.	In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <br>  <br> 6.	The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses.  Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.  The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available. <br>

<DESC>The DoS is installing BAS systems in New Embassy Compounds (NEC's) around the world. Currently there are 100 NEC's with BAS systems installed by a variety of third party vendors. The implementation of the BAS is providing many challenges for DoS oversight and management; examples of the challenges faced include: varied skillsets among FM's responsible for BAS operations; inconsistent power supplies at embassy compounds; varying skill levels among LES responsible for BAS oversight; limited resources for BAS support; limited vendor availability, responsiveness and support; language barriers impacting the ability to train LES responsible for BAS management; limited protocol for emergency response when BAS systems fail; lack of knowledge on how to modify BAS parameters for new space allocation or other NEC facility modifications; no best practice strategies for troubleshooting BAS problems; lack of a plan/process for upgrading BAS software that is outdated; and minimal knowledge of how manual overrides or modifications of BAS parameters impacts overall facility operations. These are in addition to the challenges related to a lack of basic BAS operational knowledge. The types of systems installed at NEC's involve, at a minimum, seven different BAS vendors as well as an undetermined number of third party contractors responsible for the system installations, support, and knowledge transfer. <br />The goal of this training is to provide FM's and LES with the knowledge, skills, abilities, and resources necessary for the successful integration, operation, and support of BAS systems at NEC's as well as existing embassy compounds. <br />

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for commercially available low power consumption multiband sun photometers in support of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) project.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASAs) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses,  and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for commercially available sun photometers (Note:	a commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101). <P> The AERONET project is an internationally federated network of sun photometers.  The program provides a long-term, continuous and readily accessible public domain database of aerosol optical, microphysical and radiative properties for aerosol research and characterization, validation of satellite retrievals, and synergism with other databases. <P> This global network, imposes standardization across all AERONET instrumentation such that future instruments will be compatible with the current systems in the network.	The instrumentation must have the ability to automatically make sun and sky-scan measurements according the AERONET protocols with almucantars, principle planes and direct sun triplets as documented in the AERONET webpage:	<A HREF="http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov">http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov </A>	.  The system must have the capability to collect and transmit data via the Data Collection System (DCS).	The instrument must be able to withstand harsh weather conditions including temperatures from -40 C to +50C and still be able to collect and transmit data consistently in various climate settings.  The instrumentation should be light, portable to facilitate shipping, and be easy to install in the field.  Because of poor infrastructure at many remote locations, the instrument must be able to operate on 5 watt solar panels and batteries. <P> The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. <P> Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references.  Your documentation should include data on measurement specifications, power consumption, environmental conditions and weight.  It should also include information on software and instrument options. <P> This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. <P> All responses shall be submitted to Tamika Seaforth no later than April 24, 2015.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice only; it is not a request for quotations or offers. 

The VISN 9 Network Contracting Office is conducting market research for the Huntington Veteran Center to identify potential sources for a contract within the service area to provide Re-Adjustment Counseling Services (Off-Site).  It is the intention of the Huntington Veteran Center to solicit a proposal in accordance with all terms, conditions, provisions, specifications, and schedules and award a Firm- Fixed price contract on a competitive basis under the authority of 38 USC 8153.  

BACKGROUND: BACKGROUND

Public Law 96-22 in 1979 added Section 612A to 38 U.S.C. authorizing the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide readjustment counseling to veterans of the Vietnam era (August 5, 1964 to May 7, 1975).  Subsequently amended several times between 1979 and 1989, Section 612A, currently guarantees readjustment counseling as a lifetime entitlement to Vietnam era veterans and requires no change in venue for VA's system of community-based outreach and counseling centers (Vet Centers).  Readjustment Counseling Service (RCS) currently administers a nationwide system of 300 Vet Centers located in all 50 States and surrounding territories including the District of Columbia, the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam and American Samoa.

The Vet Center mission is to provide outreach and counseling to assist Vietnam era veterans (and now veterans of the Persian gulf war and the Conflicts in Lebanon, Grenada and Panama and the Global War on Terrorism), Somalia, Korea, WWII resolved war-related psychological difficulties and to help them achieve a successful post-war readjustment to civilian life.  Toward these objectives the Vet Centers provide a mix of psychological and social services: psychological counseling and psychotherapy (individual, group, and family), outreach, networking and referral, employment counseling, education/career counseling, crisis counseling, community education, substance abuse aftercare and referral, consultation to professionals, and conjoint services at VA medical centers and clinics.

The initiating legislation also authorized VA to augment Vet Center services through contract with private sector providers for provision of readjustment counseling to veterans geographically removed from existing Vet Centers and other VA healthcare facilities.

In 1991, legislation was enacted amending Section 612A of Title 38 U.S.C. to expand the definition of veteran for readjustment counseling entitlement purposes to all post-Vietnam era veterans who served during a period and in the theatre of armed hostilities since May 7, 1975, such as existed in Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, Somalia, Korea WWII and most recently in the Persian Gulf.  The range and types of services provided to these newly eligible veteran populations are identical to those already provided to Vietnam era veterans.

 Individuals with other than honorable but more-than-dishonorable discharge may also be eligible as determined by the VA (see 38 CFR, Section 3.12).
 
NOTE:	For definitions of eligible veterans by exact periods and locations of service refer to the Contract Program Handbook (Appendix A, Chapter 2).

http://www1.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=2288



DESCRIPTION OF THE SUBJECT WORK

The contractor shall furnish readjustment counseling services to eligible veterans referred by Vet center staff members or professional staff members of VA Psychiatry, Social Work, Psychology or Nursing Services (Off-Site).  Readjustment counseling, for purposes of this contract, is counseling provided by social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, or other qualified counselors, individually or in groups, specifically directed at social, psychological, or behavioral difficulties specifically related to the post-war readjustment to civilian life.  Such difficulties may interfere with a veteran's job performance, educational pursuits, family and other interpersonal relations, or overall ability to cope with daily life.  Modalities of readjustment counseling include individual, group, and family counseling; all of which must have as their central purpose the post-war readjustment of Vietnam era and/or post-Vietnam war zone veterans.

This service does not include general mental health services, but only provides readjustment counseling for psychosocial difficulties related to post-war readjustment from military duty for example:

a.	Exposure to combat-related war trauma.

b.	Exposure to other aspects of war zone stress.

c.	Post-traumatic stress disorder (as defined by DSM-III-R) and/or other war-related social and psychological difficulties.

d.	Stressors unique to military duty for eligible veterans.

e.	Psychological concern over a possible service-connected condition.

f.		Substance abuse connected with military duty and/or post-war homecoming and readjustment.

g.	Difficult post-war experiences, including disrupted homecoming and unsuccessful re-entry into civilian roles.

h.	Concern over possible Agent Orange, biological or chemical agent exposure or ramifications thereof.

i.		Generalized alienation from society manifested by lack of expectable familial, educational and/or vocational activities.

j.		Psychosocial difficulties related to type of military discharge for other than a dishonorable discharge.

The provision of medications and physical examinations are not to be considered a component of readjustment counseling, and therefore, will not be provided under this contract mechanism.  Nonetheless, offerors should have the capability through referral to arrange for needed physical examinations, prescription medications and/or other medical treatment.  Veteran consumers should be advised that VA will not reimburse through this service for physical examinations, drugs, or other medical treatments.  In all such cases, VA medical facilities should be the priority referral for the veteran's medical care.  When this is not feasible due to geographical distance, VA Fee Basis providers should also be considered.  The contract provider should coordinate with the COR for assistance in facilitating referrals to VA medical providers.

GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF ELIGIBLE SERVICE PROVIDERS

Service providers submitting offers in response to this request for proposal must be physically located in: 

Ohio Counties (South East and Southern Ohio): Athens, Gallia, Jackson, Lawrence, Meigs, Scioto, Vinton and Washington
The geographical boundaries described here will be determined by Readjustment Counseling Service officials and local VA Medical Center officials, based upon what they consider to be geographical areas of need; e.g., a given city, county, or in a locality where a Vet Center is present but, because of large population of Vietnam era and/or post-Vietnam era eligible veterans, the Vet Center cannot adequately provide services.  

Enhanced patient access is one of the fundamental purposes for this contract. Therefore, location/proximity to the South East and Southern Ohio counties shown above is extremely important. Offerors must submit the company address of the location where the Re-Adjustment Counseling services will be performed and the distance between that location and the Counties shown above. Offerors must provide evidence of facilities compliance with all federal, state, and local fire and life safety codes including accessibility and convenience for wheelchair patients or other handicapped/disabled veterans.

VA will only make referrals to providers under this contract for circumstances where VA or other government facilities are not capable of furnishing needed services or cannot do so economically because of geographical distances.

PROCEDURE FOR SERVICE INITIATION

Service initiation under this contract will be limited to referral only by Vet Center personnel, RCS Regional Managers and/or Chief of Staff or designee at a VA medical facility.  The number, type, and frequency of readjustment counseling services provided to the veteran and/or significant others (i.e., members of the veteran's immediate family, legal guardian, or individual with whom the veteran lives or certifies an intention to live with) will be as specifically authorized by referring Vet center or VA Medical Center officials.

Upon determination of eligibility and completion of psychosocial assessment, determining the need for readjustment counseling services, a referral will be made by completion of Contract Services Authorization Form (VAF 10-5565b).  Copy 1 will be mailed or given to the veteran or significant other-who will present it to the designated service provider.  Copy 2 will be mailed to the designated contract service provider; Copy 3 will be forwarded to Medical Administration Service (MAS) at the VA Medical Center responsible for assisting the Vet Center in the local administration of the contract program.  Copy 4 will be maintained on file at the Vet Center.

NOTE:	Referral procedures are detailed in Fee/Contract Program Handbook (Appendix A, Chapter 3). See Link below:

<DESC><p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for the project is 541712 Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)<br />The small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Epidemiology Branch (EB) addresses the mission of the NIEHS by applying and extending the tools of epidemiology to study the effects of the environment on human health. EB investigators study a wide range of health effects with potential links to environmental exposures. Studies cover outcomes across the lifespan from pregnancy and child development to chronic diseases of aging, and focus on known and potential environmental hazards. EB studies often include the collection of biological and environmental samples to measure biomarkers of exposure, susceptibility, or effect. EB's research portfolio includes large multi-purpose cohorts designed to study effects of environmental exposures, genes and gene-environment interactions, genome- and epigenome-wide association studies, more narrowly focused studies in clinical or population settings, and laboratory-based mechanistic studies and covers the range of topics represented in the eight research groups. New groups addressing additional topics in environmental health are anticipated in the near future. The current eight research groups are: Aging and Neuroepidemiology, Biomarker-based Epidemiology, Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Genetics, Environment and Respiratory Disease, Molecular and Genetic Epidemiology, Pediatric Epidemiology, Reproductive Epidemiology and Women's Health.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The NIEHS seeks capability statements from qualified small businesses to provide epidemiological, scientific, technical, data management, managerial, clerical, and statistical support to Principal Investigators (PIs) within the Epidemiology Branch, Division of Intramural Research, NIEHS. The Contractor shall assist the Government by identifying and enrolling subjects, and administering, managing, and conducting epidemiological studies designed and conducted by Epidemiology Branch PIs alone or in collaboration with other scientists inside or outside of the NIEHS.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) in support of market research purposes only. The Department of State's Office of Acquisition Management, on behalf of the Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA), Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST) is seeking potential sources that are capable of providing services for performing automated face recognition (FR) to accomplish the mandates in the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002. This SSS is a posting which&nbsp; seek potential sources that are capable of providing installation, operation, and maintenance of software and hardware associated with the FR system during the like of a potential contract. Potential vendors will provide updates to the FR matching algorithm (to meet the evolving state-of-the-art) aw well as any necessary software and hardware. <br /><br />Biometric technology is required by the Department of State (DoS) to meet mandates in the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002. The Department of State (DoS) believes that biometric recognition systems will (a) more reliable confirm the identity of an individual holding a visa or passport;(b) facilitate the detection of the fraudulent applications; (c) increase the security of U.S. visas and passports; (d) detect and/or deter known terrorists or criminals; and (e) verify the identity of travelers at U.S. ports of entry. The biometric capability to be provided by the selected vendor will support the issuance of U.S. visa and passport travel documents and petitions for Diversity Visa (DV).&nbsp; For approximately 10 years DoS has been performing automated face recognition (FR) to accomplish the goals stated above. At present, the Visa and Passport face galleries contain over 275 million images combined, which are among the largest face recognition datasets in the world and growing annually at an anticipated rate of 23 million images per year. Every passport and visa application requires a face recognition search of the legacy and watch-list galleries.&nbsp; As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this SSS are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.<br /><br />Any information submitted by respondents to this SSS is voluntary and are not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not infividually be notified of the results of any Government assessments. <br /><br />The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent acquisition. The government's evaluation of the Capabilities Package received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open unrestricted competition, a set-aside for small businesses, or as a set aside for the socio-economic programs (e.g. HUBZone, WOSB, SDVOSB, etc.).
<p>SCOPE OF WORK<br /><br />The Department of State is seeking&nbsp;businesses' who believe thay can satisfy all or part of the requirements for providing a large-scale, , high-throughput FR system. Proposed solutions must comply with recognized industry standards, where applicable.<br /><br />For the purpose of this SSS, an FR solution provides the following:<br />Ability to enroll a face photograph image (template) into a gallery for matching. The number of enrolled templates will exceed 300 million. It is expected that at least 15 million passport, 12 million visa, and 13 million DV new images will need to be enrolled each year.<br />Ability to perform automated one-to-one matching (verification) of face photograph images (templates).<br /><br />Ability to perform automated open-set one-to-many matching (identification) of face images. The number of images (biometric templates) searched may range from 1,000 (or less) to 275,000,000 (or more). The search space may be (a) extended to cover multiple galleries or watch-lists and (b) reduced using biographical indexing (filtering). The result of an identification search should be a sorted list (candidate list), of size L, containing the subset of L identities whose (numeric) values exceed a decision threshold, t. The parameters L and t can be user-specified. The identification search should be able to ascertain when no matching identities are found within specified parameters.&nbsp; Ability to process an excess of enrollment and search requests (exceeding 50,000 per hour) during peak load times.<br />Ability to filter the search results of an identification task based on metadata associated with each image.&nbsp; Ability to integrate enrollment and matching capabilities for other biometric modalities, such as iris.<br />Ability to combine information from multiple biometric modalities (e.g., iris) to perform a single recognition decision (biometric fusion).<br />Shall be based on a Linux architecture that minimizes or preferably eliminates proprietary hardware, firmware, or software. Proprietary elements such as the FR matching algorithm must include provision for Government access to usage on a fair and equitable licensing basis.&nbsp; Shall deploy to at least two geographically-diverse environments to share the computational load and to provide failover capabilities.&nbsp; Shall enroll DoS' legacy image databases.<br />Shall read biometric data from persistent storage (which may include one or more platforms such as Oracle database(s), Hadoop Distributed File Systems, or other mechanisms accessible via SOAP or Representational State Transfer (ReST) web services), perform FR on read data, and write transaction outputs as records to persistent storage. Shall record the match score for each candidate (potential match) from the FR search as an output.<br />Shall provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) software tool to facilitate manual review of face images by trained face examiners.&nbsp; Shall provide a software utility for manual enrollment of face images (based on manually entered eye positions), when the automated system cannot find the eyes.<br />Shall provide a means to programmatically invoke enrollment or matching capabilities via an Application Programming Interface (API) capable of being exposed as SOAP web services.&nbsp; In addition, Vendors are required to provide, install, operate, and maintain all software and hardware associated with the FR system during the lifetime of the contract. Vendors will provide updates to the FR matching algorithm (to meet the evolving state-of-the-art) as well as any necessary software and hardware at no additional cost to the Government.<br /><br />QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS<br />It is mandatory that contractors submitting a capability statement related to activities required to establish, deliver, and manage services for the DOS shall be appraised for CMMI&reg; for Development (CMMI-DEV&reg;) or CMMI&reg; for Services (CMMI-SVC&reg;), Level 3 compliance. <br />Firms must have a system of internal controls to manage (control, use, preserve, protect, repair, and maintain) Government property in its possession.

b. The Joint Commission's Environment of Care (EC) standards require written Utility Management Plans. The Utility Management Plan must ensure reliability, control risks, reduce failures, and train users and operators of the Electrical Power Distribution System. 
c. Occupational Safety and Health Requirements (OSHA) Part 1910 Subpart J, The control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout) (1910.147); Occupational Safety and Health Requirements Part 1910 Subpart S , Electrical (1910.301-1910.399); and Safety and Health Regulations for Construction Part 1926 Subpart K, Electrical (1926.400-1926.449) apply. 
d. Working on energized electrical equipment is inherently dangerous to patients, staff, visitors, and VHA property. Such actions, if unplanned or poorly executed, can result in disruption of operations, injuries, loss of life and/or loss of property. 

3. POLICY: It is VHA policy that the Electrical Power Distribution System must operate in a safe, reliable, and efficient manner, recognizing its importance and potential danger; and in compliance with The Joint Commission, OSHA, and NFPA electrical standards. 

4. RESPONSIBILITIES: 

a. Veterans Integrated Service Network Director. The Veteran Integrated Service Network (VISN) Director is responsible for ensuring that: 
     (1) The installation, operation, testing, and maintenance of Electrical Power Distribution Systems meet or exceed The Joint Commission, NFPA, and other applicable requirements; 
     (2) That all work on this system complies with OSHA and NFPA standards; and 
     (3) Appropriate resources are provided to each medical facility in order to ensure compliance. To ensure each subordinate VA medical facility is in compliance with this Directive, the VISN Director must: 
     (a) Delegate review and interpretation of electrical power system documentation, including 
tracking of status reports regarding the installation, operation, testing, and maintenance of Electrical Power Distribution Systems within the Network to a qualified member of the VISN staff. 
     
July 25, 2014 											VHA DIRECTIVE 1028 

     (b) Conduct a status verification survey annually on or before May 1st using the survey tool found on the VHA Center for Engineering and Occupational Safety and Health (CEOSH) website at: (http://vaww.ceosh.med.va.gov/OnlineSurveys/Scripts/ezs.exe?DATABASE=ElectDirComp& ACTION=START). NOTE: This is an internal Web site and is not available to the public. 

     b. Medical Facility Director. 

     (1) The medical facility Director is accountable to the VISN Director for ensuring that the installation, operation, testing, and maintenance of Electrical Power Distribution Systems meets or exceeds The Joint Commission, NFPA, and other applicable requirements; and that all work on this system complies with OSHA and NFPA standards. 
     (2) The medical facility Director is responsible for ensuring: 
     (a) Appropriate resources (funds, equipment and qualified personnel) are allocated in order to achieve compliance; 
     (b) Only qualified senior staff at the facility and/or qualified electrical contract professionals are authorized to execute any design, installation, operation, testing, and maintenance of the Electrical Power Distribution System in accordance with The Joint Commission and NFPA requirements and that all work on these systems is compliant with OSHA standards; 
     (c) Appropriate actions are taken to correct deficiencies found in the Electrical Power Distribution System; 
     (d) All electrical work is executed with all proximate energized circuits de-energized. The Process of Achieving an Electrically Safe Work Condition as prescribed in NFPA 70E shall be followed to ensure electrical equipment is de-energized. It is the intent of this directive to make planned electrical system shutdowns for maintenance/repair the standard operating procedure, not the exception; 
     (e) If work on energized electrical system components cannot be avoided, a management system is developed and implemented so that work on energized equipment does not take place without the medical facility Director's prior knowledge and approval; and 
     (f) Written procedures are established to prepare the medical center for a planned electrical outage. The procedures must take into account the worst case of risk to patients, staff, visitors, and VHA property. When a planned electrical outage cannot be accomplished, the following requirements are mandatory for working on energized circuit: 

          1. Full and proper personal protective equipment (PPE) is available and worn by the qualified persons performing the work. PPE shall include, but not be limited to, appropriate clothing, eye protection, face protection, hearing protection, gloves, certified and tested insulating material to cover exposed energized electrical components, and certified and tested insulated tools. NOTE: Refer to the NFPA 70E, and General Safety Guidebook for guidance on the appropriate PPE. 
         2. Qualified persons (e.g. electricians) are provided with the appropriate PPE, including arc-rated (AR) clothing. The appropriate PPE is to be determined in accordance with requirements of NFPA 70E which include assessment of the voltage, incident energy and hazard risk category. 
          3. Before initiating work, a specific work plan is developed and a peer review of the plan documented.  

        
July 25, 2014 											VHA DIRECTIVE 1028 

         a. The work plan must include: procedures to be used on and near the energized electrical equipment, barriers to be installed, safety equipment to be provided, and exit paths to be accessed. 
          b. Energized work is only to be accomplished by Qualified Persons as defined in NFPA 70E. As noted therein, qualified person shall be trained and knowledgeable of the construction and operation of equipment or a specific work method and be trained to recognize and avoid the electrical hazards that might be present. The employer is required to document that each qualified person has received such training. 
          c. An Energized Electrical Work Permit must be obtained from the appropriate Office (typically within Engineering or Safety service). The Energized Electrical Work Permit shall include Elements of Work Permit identified in NFPA 70E. 
          d. Any energized electrical work plan must have the prior knowledge and approval of the medical facility Director. However, the Chief of Engineering Service may approve energized electrical work plan for Branch Circuits (i.e., those circuits and components thereof from the final overcurrent protecting devices to the outlets) that do not serve the critical patient care areas, such as Surgery Rooms, Critical Care, Intensive Care, Dialysis Units, Isolation Rooms, Catheterization Laboratories, Emergency Rooms, or Sterile Processing Areas. 
     (3) A Utility Systems Management Plan is developed which meets, or exceeds The Joint Commission, OSHA, and NFPA requirements and is approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facility EC committee and/or medical facility Director. 
     (4) Arc flash and shock hazards are analyzed, to include the following: 
     (a) A shock hazard analysis must be performed to determine the voltage(s) to which personnel will be exposed, boundary requirements, and the PPE necessary to minimize the possibility of electrical shock to personnel. 
     (b) An arc flash hazard analysis determines the arc flash protection boundary and the PPE required for employee protection with within the arc flash protection boundary. 
     (c) The shock hazard and arc flash hazard analyses, along with any subsequent system labeling or output reports, must comply with the requirements outlined in NFPA 70E and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard 1584. The preceding analyses, labeling and reports must be updated regularly to ensure accuracy and reflect current facility conditions, including additions, upgrades and other changes that occurred following completion of the previous analyses. 

     (5) The Electrical Power Distribution System is supplied by a source of power from the Utility Power Company (UPC). A second independent source from the UPC, referred to as utility redundant feed, should be considered only when utility power reliability is proven to be questionable or it can be justified as cost effective. 
     (6) Where there are two sources of power supplies (Primary and Redundant Feeds) coming from the UPC, a test is coordinated with the UPC to maintain the tie-circuit breaker, or transfer switch for such system every 36-months. 
      (7) Where required by NFPA 70, NFPA 99, or NFPA 101, an Essential Electrical System (EES) is provided for each building; it must include the following: 
     (a) EES must consist of an alternate source of power, all connected electrical power distribution systems, and ancillary equipment 
July 25, 2014 											VHA DIRECTIVE 1028  

     (b) The EES must have a minimum of two independent sources of power: a normal source generally supplying electrical power to the entire Electrical Power Distribution System, and one or more alternate sources for use when the normal source of power is interrupted. The alternate source must be one or more emergency generator(s) located on the facility property. NOTE: When the alternate source requirements are sufficiently small, a stored energy (battery) supplied source may be considered. 
     (8) The EES, including all related components, such as Automatic Transfer Switches and emergency generators, must be inspected weekly. 
     (9) The EES, including all related components, is exercised under load at least monthly, for a minimum of 30 minutes, in accordance with the requirements of NFPA 99 and NFPA 110. 
     (10) All risks to the patients, staff, visitors, and VHA property is mitigated with proper planning prior to any test of the EES and with safe execution during the test period. Individual medical facilities with a significant rate of key staff turnover, absence of key staff during the most recent test, significant incidents during the most recent test, significant modifications to the Electrical Power Distribution System, significant modifications or seasonal variation to the electrical loads, may consider more frequent testing of the EES. 
     (11) A test of the EES that lasts for 4 hours continuously should be planned and executed every 36 months, in accordance with the requirements of NFPA 99 and NFPA 110. This test must meet The Joint Commission requirements to be under load (dynamic or static) of at least 30 percent of the nameplate load. Locations at high altitude where generator capacity is to be derated, 30 percent of the derated generator capacity should be used (versus 30 percent of the nameplate value). NOTE: The Joint Commission now requires a 4-hour generator test under load (dynamic or static) that is at least 30 percent of the nameplate rating of the generator once every 36 months. If a facility's generator requires an annual load bank to comply with EC.02.05.07 EP 5, it will also require a load bank every 36 months for 4 hours to comply with EC.02.05.07 EP 8. It is important to note the annual load bank only exceeds 30 percent for 1.5 hours.

      (a)This test must meet two objectives: 

	1. EES Response a thorough test of the EES initiated by a loss of utility normal power. 

	2. Facility Staff Response a thorough test of the medical center staff's ability to operate while restricted only to the EES. 
     (b) This test requires coordination with the local UPC. The main electrical switch, owned by the local UPC that serves the medical facility, must be opened to simulate a total electrical power outage. This switch is to remain opened for a minimum of 4 hours continuously. During this time, the facility's staff must test, inspect, and record the operation of the EES, including all related components. 
  (c) Deficiencies found in the EES must be recorded promptly, and corrected in a timely manner.  
  (d) This test may be incorporated into the facility-wide disaster drills required by The Joint Commission. Moreover, an unscheduled facility power outage of at least 4 hours continuous duration may be documented and considered the equivalent of the EES test, providing that all requirements listed in subparagraph 4b(11)(b) are met. 
     (e) Testing, maintenance, and exercising of the EES, including all related components, must be executed to meet the requirements of NFPA 99 and NFPA 110, whichever is more stringent. 
July 25, 2014 											VHA DIRECTIVE 1028   

     (12) Transformers, including all related components, are inspected, tested, and maintained every 36 months. The following is a minimum list of items to be inspected, tested, and maintained: (a) Transformers of 500 Kilovolt-Amps (kVA) or larger must be cleaned exteriorly, inspected for signs of overheating with infra-red thermal detecting equipment, and inspected for any damage to the housing, connection points, or insulation. 
     (b) Liquid cooled transformers must have the cooling liquid tested and replaced, when tests indicate that the liquid no longer meets manufacturer's specification. The liquid must be re-filled to meet the manufacturer's specification. 
     (c) Dry type transformers must be thoroughly cleaned exteriorly, and inspected for overheating with infra-red thermal detecting equipment. 

     (13) Electrical equipment (including, but not limited to switchgears, switchboards, distribution panels, motor control centers, and all related components) is inspected, tested, maintained, and/or calibrated every 36 months, and all work must be documented. NOTE: The National Electrical Testing Association (NETA) provides guidance which is considered best practice for the maintenance of electrical equipment; these practices should be followed to the extent possible.

     (a) Use lint-free rags to clean conductors, contact points between the circuit breakers and main buss bars, buss bars and interior of the electrical equipment. Use a vacuum cleaner to remove large debris; compressed air is not to be used for this purpose. Visually inspect for signs of overheating, misaligned contacts, damaged insulation, or lose lugs. (b) Lubricate all moving parts with manufacturer's approved lubricants. 
     (c)Test and exercise circuit breakers located in switchgears, switchboard, and distribution panels to ensure operation under overload, and short circuit conditions. NOTE: The following maintenance requirements, although not mandatory, are strongly encouraged: All molded case circuit breakers (frames size 225 amps or less) should be tested annually to determine if contacts open and reclose when breaker is manually tripped and restored. All panels are to be tested including emergency panels. If no failures are encountered and the test is fully documented, the interval between molded case breaker testing may be extended in 6-month increments, up to but not to exceed 36 months between successive tests. 
     (d) Test ground fault protection devices for proper function if they are installed in the Electrical Power Distribution System. 
     (e) Inspect and tighten ground connections. Test ground resistance for the entire facility grounding system. 
       (f) Identify the hot spots in the electrical equipment by using infra-red thermal detecting equipment. Tighten problem connections to meet equipment manufacturers' specification using a torque wrench or other approved devices. 
     (g) Calibrate and maintain adjustable protective relays. 
     (h) Test all control systems equipment for proper operation after maintenance is performed and before placing them back in normal service. 

     (i) To ensure access is limited to qualified persons, electrical equipment is to be secured. For example, electrical panels located in corridors or other public areas are to be locked or otherwise secured.

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>Afghanistan Basic Trainer/Light Lift (BT/LL) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) Program Request for Information (RFI) Synopsis. This synopsis is a RFI only. This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation is being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this RFI notice is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. There is no entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government for response to this RFI. The information obtained from industry's response to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP. In the following RFI Synopsis, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Wright-Patterson AFB is contemplating a single award, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. Period of Performance will be for one (1) basic year with four (4) one (1) year options.</p>
<p>The below listed paragraphs and technical requirements describe an acquisition strategy for an anticipated CLS program for the BT/LL program in Afghanistan. The contractor is to respond to the best of their ability with the qualifications of the contractor team to perform this program and answer all questions stated.</p>
<p>Government Furnished Property The government will provide up to twenty-six (26) Cessna C-208B aircraft and one (1) C-208B Aircrew Training Device (ATD).</p>
<p>Contractor Maintenance Support CLS should encompass all launch, recovery, towing and flight line servicing, including actions required for operations and maintenance of aircraft subsystems and support equipment. CLS should include aircraft maintenance and personnel, all materials, inspections, publications, supply of all contractor owned and maintained spares and support equipment, repair and overhaul of all repairable spares, maintenance, repair or replacement of all support equipment, engine repair and engine overhaul. The contractor must use a "Remove/Replace" concept for maintenance for the aircraft and ground equipment supporting the operations of the fleet and must take advantage of the common commercial pool of parts.</p>
<p>All aircraft and equipment are to be maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (including service bulletins, etc.). Where licensed or certified personnel are required for proper task performance or record entry, they must be provided.</p>
<p>Q1: Does your firm have experience providing CLS services?</p>
<p>Include past performance ratings/evaluation s (e.g. Contractor Performance Assessment Ratings, Award Fee, similar contract awards).<br /><br />Q2: What experience does your firm have with FAA certification and maintaining airworthiness? How would your firm seek to establish and/or maintain this capability for yourself or your potential suppliers? Information should be pertinent and specific to CLS.</p>
<p>Maintenance Training The contractor will provide the necessary technician and organizational level maintenance training based on data available under this program, developed and presented in accordance with the specific Afghanistan equipment. Contractor provided training shall be transition-type training intended to enhance the existing skill sets already possessed by the Afghan Air Force (AAF) students in their particular field of expertise. This maintenance training must develop a cadre of maintainers to provide Afghan maintenance on the C-208B aircraft without oversight correction. All maintenance actions must be witnessed and signed off by an FAA Airframe and Powerplant (A&amp;P) certified maintenance technician as long as the aircraft are in USAF ownership. Maintenance training shall also include Supply Chain Management training to allow Afghan maintainers to order aircraft parts for maintenance actions.</p>
<p>Q3: Describe approach to maintenance training, specifically for non-English speaking students.</p>
<p>The Contractor will also provide Technical English language training to AAF maintenance students. AAF maintenance students will be taught conversational English separately; however a need exists to enhance that basic English training with Technical English which includes language that may be present in technical documents or aircraft maintenance manuals. AAF maintainers will need to be able to read and understand all maintenance manuals associated with the aircraft as these will not be translated into their native languages.</p>
<p>Q4: Describe your approach to providing Technical English training.</p>
<p>All responsible sources interested in providing services for this requirement are requested to provide a written summary of information concerning their technical certifications, capabilities, experience (current services or contracts - to include points of contact, email address and telephone numbers) and corporate background. Interested parties should provide a description of potential approaches for review by the Government no later than 14 days from the date of issuance of this RFI. Information provided per this synopsis must indicate in writing, whether your company is a large, small, disadvantaged, or woman owned business. This acquisition will fall under NAICS 336411 and its applicable size standard. Responses shall be limited to 15 pages or less. The response package should contain one (1) copy provided in ADOBE ACROBAT (.pdf) format and typographical font of 10 or greater. All response packages should be emailed to the attention of the Contracting Officer listed below.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary. This RFI does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government's ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this RFI.</p>

<DESC>U.S. Army Contracting Command- Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC APG) intends to modify Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-II (ENVG) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts W91CRB-10-C-0177 and W91CRB-10-C-0179; the Government shall extend the period of performance for an additional 12 (twelve) months, using the authority provided by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(2)(ii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supply or Service will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The current contracts are awarded to Exelis, Inc of RoanokeVA (W91CRB-10-C-0177), and L-3 Systems, Inc of Londonberry NH (W91CRB-10-C-0179). The extension is required to enable the vendors to design, build, and conduct qualification testing on Helmet Mount Assemblies (HMAs). An extension shall allow for the potential procurement of 6,600 (Exelis Contract W91CRB-10-C-0177) and 7,700 (L-3 Contract W91CRB-10-C-0179) HMAs. The Government intends to negotiate solely with Exelis and L-3; Exelis and L-3 have independently designed and developed ENVG systems with designs that are completely distinctive and proprietary to each vendor. This includes the HMA used to attach the ENVG system to a Soldier's helmet; no commercial off-the-shelf, modified commercial off-the-shelf, or Government HMAs suffice.  <br>  <br> Exelis and L-3 are currently the only two qualified sources that possess the requisite capability to design, build, and test HMAs for their respective proprietary systems, and within the necessary amount of time. Any other prospective manufacturers (and their suppliers) would need be qualified by the Government to perform the requirement; the qualification process would take longer than the anticipated fielding gap, and would be prohibitive from a cost standpoint. <br>  <br> The NAICS Code for this requirement is 339115, with a size standard of 500. Other sources interested in this requirement may identify their interest and capability by responding to this synopsis/ special notice. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government will only consider capability submission(s) received within fifteen (15) days of this synopsis/ special notice. Information provided will be used only to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. All respondents must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) program, and have a valid DUNS number, CAGE Code, and Tax Identification Number. All responses and questions must be written and submitted via electronic mail (Email) to the Government POC; Contact Mr. Andrew Mitchell at Andrew.C.Mitchell1.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>On July 18, 2012, the Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Region, awarded a requirement for the design and installation of a new laser light show at Grand Coulee Dam. The intent of this project was to procure a laser light show that provides a stimulating, memorable, quality laser light experience while at the same time providing the viewing public with a better understanding of Reclamation's service to the public as represented by Grand Coulee Dam and other features of the Columbia Basin Project.
In addition to designing the laser light program, offerors were required to be able to supply and install the laser light equipment. Selection procedures were conducted in a two-phase solicitation process similar to that process set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 36.3, Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures. 
The resulting contract is a firm-fixed price type contract with a base year and four option years. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code associated with this project is 713990. The small business size standard applicable to this project is $7.0 million in gross annual receipts averaged over the previous three 1-year accounting periods. The order of magnitude for this project is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00. This procurement was advertised on an unrestricted basis. Offers were accepted from all responsive and responsible small and large business concerns. Prospective contractors were required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to the award of the contract (for more information regarding registering in SAM, please visit www.sam.gov.).
The government intends to exercise Option Year One of Contract No. R12PC10009, Laser Light Show, with an award date of the modification to the incumbent contractor issued no later than May 23, 2015, with an additional three option years exercised thereafter in accordance with FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (MAR 2009), included in contract, until the end of Option Year Four on May 23, 2019.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Malvern Instruments Incorporated, 117 Flanders Road, STE 110, Westborough, MA 01581. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p><br />This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to award a non-competitive, sole source contract to Malvern Instruments Incorporated, 117 Flanders Road, STE 110, Westborough, MA 01581 for a Particle Analyzer.</p>
<p>The FBI has a requirement to directly and accurately measure the particle size of explosive compositions or their precursor materials. This capability will add greater flexibility in terms of answering time sensitive requests, as well as provide the FBI the ability to evaluate the effects of different particle sizes on the hazards and performance of an explosive which is of great importance to the intelligence community. Having the capability to precisely and accurately determine the particle size of an improvised explosive will also all the FBI to design better, more detailed, full-scale tests in that estimates of changing various technical parameters can be more thoroughly assessed before these tests are performed, saving crucial time and funding since not as many full-scale tests need to be performed.</p>
<p>The FBI has found that the Malvern Mastersizer 3000 Laser Diffraction System is the only particle size analyzer that can meet the FBI requirements listed below:</p>
<p>1. System must be a laser diffraction type instrument;<br />2. System must be able to measure particle sizes in the range of approximately 0.02 - 3500 microns;<br />3. System must be able to measure samples in both dry and liquid suspensions;<br />4. System must possess an angular detection span of approximately 0.02 - 140 degrees;<br />5. System must allow the operator to change samples easily and quickly ( ~ &lt; 30 seconds);<br />6. The power of the blue laser light source must be greater than 15mW to facilitate a particle size resolution in the sub-micron range;<br />7. The system must be able to produce a reproducible dispersion of powder samples;<br />8. The system must come equipped with a vacuum system for sample collection;<br />9. The system must come equipped with applicable in-take filters;<br />10. The system must come equipped with specific dry and wet sample cells that the system interface control automatically recognizes;<br />11. System must come with its own computer and software environment that facilitates stand-alone operation, interface control, data processing and printing;<br />12. The software must be able to easily output graphs and tables for use in technical reports;<br />13. The software must be able to display data results in various graphical formats, such as bar and scatter graphs, including appropriate error bars.</p>
<p>The FBI performed market research to determine if any other company manufactured a particle size analyzer meeting the requirements of the FBI. Other manufacturers were considered, however, did not meet the particle size range technical requirements. The Malvern Mastersizer 3000 Laser Diffraction System was the only system that met all the requirements of the FBI. Malvern Instruments Incorporated is the sole manufacturer and distributer of the Mastersizer 3000 Laser Diffraction System and therefore is the only vendor that can fulfill the specialized and unique technical research requirement of the FBI.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to this office by 08:00 am, EST, April 13, 2015, by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Promega Corporation, 2800 Woods Hollow Road, Madison, WI 53711. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p><br />This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to award a non-competitive, sole source contract to Promega Corporation, 2800 Woods Hollow Road, Madison, WI 53711for Promega PowerPlex kits.</p>
<p>The FBI is currently validating the Promega PowerPlex kits for use within the laboratory. PowerPlex Y23 is a Y STR specific amplification kit, and contains much more genetic information than the kit currently used by the FBI for casework. Historically Y STR typing has only been sufficient to identify males of the same genetic lineage; however, the PowerPlex kit contains rapidly mutating loci which may be sufficient to distinguish males from one generation to the next. Identification of male specific DNA is important in sexual assault samples where there may be a mixture of male and female DNA.</p>
<p>Promega Corporation is the sole-manufacturer and sole-provider of the PowerPlex &reg; Y23 System, 200rxn that is needed to meet the FBI's requirement.</p>
<p>Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement can only be provided by Promega Corporation as they are the sole-manufacturer and supplier of this product.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to this office by 08:00 am, EST, April 13, 2015, by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov.

<DESC>It is the Governments intent to compete a requirement for cataloging and producing short topic-specific training segments for the Department of the Navys Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Offices (DON SAPRO) training video library on a limited source basis between Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) and Armed Forces Services Corporation (AFSC).  


Under the resultant purchase order, the contractor will be required to compile and edit Government provided raw documentary video footage into fifteen short topic-specific segments with a maximum of 150 minutes of final video footage and accompanying facilitated group discussion guides. The final product shall consist of fifteen training video segments (five to ten minutes per video topic) and fifteen facilitated group discussion guides (five to ten minutes per video topic) with both a basic and advanced level.
 The contractor shall provide fifty copies of each video and each handout. The finished videos, at a minimum, shall be full HD with 1920x1080 resolution and twenty-four frames per second and be web compatible. 


The completion date for the videos will be staggered with the first five videos (videos 1 through 5) due five months after award, the second five videos (videos 6 through 10) due seven months after award, and the last five videos (videos 11 through 15) due nine months after award. The circumstances surrounding this requirement are unique in that the Government does not currently own all of the raw footage needed to produce the fifteen short topic-specific videos. SAIC is currently recording and cataloguing a significant portion of the raw documentary footage needed for these short topic-specific training segments under Contract N00189-12-C-Z158.
 SAICs raw documentary footage will be provided to the Government upon the completion of Contract N00189-12-C-Z158 in August 2015.


SAIC and AFSC have been determined to be the only contractors potentially capable of meeting this requirement within the required timeline due to their respective and unique digital video cataloguing systems and databases and their experience with regard to this sensitive issue. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, the Government will consider all responses received within seven days after the date of publication of this notice of intent.
 A determination by the Government not to compete the requirement among additional vendors is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 


The applicable NAICS Code is 512191. All responses may be emailed to Danielle Udinson at danielle.udinson@navy.mil. Please reference number N00189-15-T-0125.

<SOLNBR>09-032
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:gilham.michael@epa.gov">Michael Gilham</a>
<DESC>1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY.  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) / Headquarters Procurement Operations Division (HPOD) / Administrative Contract Service Center (ACSC).
2.  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED. The purpose of this justification is to extend the Office of Civil Enforcement (OCE) Mission Support contracts ? EP-W-09-032 with Leidos, Inc., and EP-W-09-033 with Eastern Research Group, Inc. (ERG) ? for three months, with six one-month option periods, due to a pre-award protest filed against Request for Proposals #SOL-DC-13-00031 which was intended to award a follow-on vehicle to the expiring contracts. Pursuant to FAR Subpart 33.104, the Contracting Officer suspended contract award after the agency received the protest from the Government Accountability Office (GAO).  
3. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY?S NEEDS (INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VALUE). The purpose of the services provided under the OCE Mission Support contracts is to assist the EPA civil enforcement program protect the environment and human health by assuring compliance with federal environmental laws. Civil enforcement encompasses the investigations conducted, and the cases filed and settled, to address environmental violations including EPA administrative actions and judicial cases referred to the Department of Justice (DOJ). EPA works closely with states (e.g., in the joint development of cases) as well as with tribes and other federal agencies to implement enforcement programs. Civil enforcement actions serve a number of important goals such as returning violators to compliance, eliminating or preventing environmental harm, deterring the violator from future violations and others from misconduct, and preserving a level playing field for responsible companies that work hard to abide by the law. The agency puts an emphasis on those actions that reduce the  most significant risks to human health and the environment; and it has extensive consultation with states and other stakeholders on the determination of risk-based priorities.         The OCE, within the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, and its regional counterparts, is charged with the development, litigation, and settlement of administrative and civil judicial cases against violators of the environmental laws pursuant to federal environmental statutes. These include the Clean Water Act (CWA); Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA); Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuary Act (MPRSA); Clean Air Act (CAA); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); Oil Pollution Act (OPA); Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); Federal Facility Compliance Act (FFCA); Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA); Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA); Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA); and Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act (Battery Act).
The OCE Mission Support contractors provide analytical, technical, and administrative support services to OCE and other EPA offices, regions, states, U.S. territories, and tribes. Major activities can include case development and settlement negotiation strategies support; developing management controls and data systems for assisting with enforcement of, and monitoring compliance with, all national enforcement initiatives and programs; targeting, developing, and implementing compliance assurance activities to monitor and improve compliance of regulated pollution sources; ensuring effective enforcement of environmental requirements; compliance monitoring including on-site inspections and investigations of pollution sources; motivating the regulated community to voluntarily discover, disclose, and correct violations; developing and implementing, in association with the National Enforcement Training Institute (NETI), enforcement related training and workshops; monitoring and enfo rcing federal, and federally-authorized, state programs; and providing support to Regions, states, territories, tribes, and other regulatory authorities. 
These requirements are perpetual in that there is no foreseeable ?end date? when these services will not be required by the agency. The maximum estimated value for the three month extension of both contracts is $1,400,000 ($700,000 each). Each option period (one month) is estimated at $200,000 per contract. This estimate is based on the average spend per invoice period, as well as the time of year of the extension, certain inspections which are done more frequently in the spring/summer time, the amount of the current ongoing work, and the slowdown in work as we have approached ceiling and funding capacity.
4. AN IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1:  only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.
5. A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTORS? UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED. The contractors listed under Section Two of this document are currently providing support for the requirement. This is ongoing work, the majority of which is for case and settlement negotiations support and inspections. Until the follow-on contract(s) are awarded, Leidos and ERG are the only sources that possess the ability to perform the EPA requirement in a timely, uninterrupted, and cost-effective manner.
Cases and negotiations are initiated under single or multiple EPA statutes. Most cases or negotiations involve confidential business information (CBI) and the contractors are allowed access to this CBI. There are various requirements under the different statutes for access to CBI, with TSCA and RCRA being the most stringent. Currently, both contractors have work assignments under which they must access TSCA and/or RCRA CBI. Contractors have to be certified to receive these types of CBI. Currently Leidos and ERG both have employees that have been approved to receive such CBI under the OCE mission contracts. Employees have to go through a testing process for both TSCA and RCRA CBI as well as annual refresher training for TSCA CBI. Also, both contractors have a required EPA approved TSCA CBI room at their facility.
When new contract awards are made, the TSCA and RCRA CBI requirements require an announcement in the Federal Register stating that the awardee will be allowed access to TSCA and RCRA CBI. This requirement allows time for businesses to respond to the announcement. Meeting all of the TSCA and RCRA CBI requirements ? announcement period in the Federal Register, approval of employees to access the CBI, and the creation and approval of a TSCA CBI room would take a minimum of 60 days to complete. An open competition to compete the extension period would cause unnecessary and damaging delay and costs, and would be impossible to implement with the TSCA and RCRA CBI requirements. 
In addition, inspectors need to be credentialed by EPA to conduct inspections under the aforementioned statutes (see Section Three). Credentialing requirements include having the inspectors complete specialized courses as well on the job training for each statute they are credentialed to inspect under, being trained in EPA?s Safety and Health requirements, and passing a moderate background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management. Both current contractors have credentialed inspectors and have been trained in the requisite EPA requirements which will ensure uninterrupted support in compliance inspections.
Because the current contractors have staff already approved by EPA to access TSCA and RCRA CBI, an EPA approved TSCA CBI room, and inspectors that have EPA issued credentials, they are the only contractors that can continue the current work being done under each contract. Also, OCE?s procurement initiation notice had required a two month overlap between the current contracts and any new contract(s) to allow time for the CBI and inspector requirements to be met while current work continued. 6.  A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS OR WILL BE PUBLICIZED AS REQUIRED BY SUBPART 5.2 AND, IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER 5.202 APPLIES. As required by FAR Part 5.2, a notice of the intent to extend the two current OCE Mission contracts was publicized in FedBizOpps on February 26, 2015 (postings:  Extension of EP-W-09-032 and Extension of EP-W-09-033).
7.   A DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE. At the respective times of award, the Government determined that the cost plus fixed fee dollar values of the OCE contracts were fair and reasonable. The respective extensions to the contracts are for three months from April 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015. If the option periods are needed (six one-month option periods), they will extend the contract end dates up to December 31, 2015. The estimated cost of the extensions is based on previous invoiced amounts and direct and indirect billing rates that have already been determined to be fair and reasonable.  Therefore, the Contracting Officer hereby determines that the anticipated cost to the Government for the extensions is fair and reasonable.   
8. A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED. Market research was not conducted for this action as doing so was not relevant to the contract extensions. Extensive market research was conducted during the pre-solicitation phases of both the previous and current acquisition. 
9. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. The work performed under these contracts provides critical and indispensable services to the Agency, DOJ, state, tribes, and the general public, and the continuity of these services is imperative. If the current contracts were allowed to end, and there was a lapse in support services, it would cause irreparable damage, specifically to ongoing cases and settlement negotiations. There is the potential that cases could be overturned and negotiations could be halted and settlements not reached. There is additional potential for the U.S. Treasury to lose funds since the settlements reached have the violators/defendants pay the settlement amounts directly to the Treasury. It is imperative that the current OCE Mission Support contracts remain active to fully provide required services to EPA. 
A break in these essential services at any point would adversely impact the EPA, as well as the public in both health and economic perspectives. It is vital that the agency be able to continue these ongoing OCE Mission Support services with the current contractors. Therefore, as a result of the halt to the award of a new contract(s), it is imperative that both contracts be extended to assure that there is no gap in essential services. 
10. A LISTING OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED IN WRITING AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION. Based upon the rationale contained in the foregoing, no other sources will be solicited for the period of the extension.
11. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS REQUIRED. The current solicitation, that is under protest, was competed under full and open competition, as the next requirement will be. When the government begins acquisition planning for OCE Mission Support in four years, it will again opt for a full and open and competition, thus eliminating all barriers to competition.

<a href="mailto:gilham.michael@epa.gov">Michael Gilham</a>
<DESC>1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY.  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) / Headquarters Procurement Operations Division (HPOD) / Administrative Contract Service Center (ACSC).
2.  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED. The purpose of this justification is to extend the Office of Civil Enforcement (OCE) Mission Support contracts ? EP-W-09-032 with Leidos, Inc., and EP-W-09-033 with Eastern Research Group, Inc. (ERG) ? for three months, with six one-month option periods, due to a pre-award protest filed against Request for Proposals #SOL-DC-13-00031 which was intended to award a follow-on vehicle to the expiring contracts. Pursuant to FAR Subpart 33.104, the Contracting Officer suspended contract award after the agency received the protest from the Government Accountability Office (GAO).  
3. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY?S NEEDS (INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VALUE). The purpose of the services provided under the OCE Mission Support contracts is to assist the EPA civil enforcement program protect the environment and human health by assuring compliance with federal environmental laws. Civil enforcement encompasses the investigations conducted, and the cases filed and settled, to address environmental violations including EPA administrative actions and judicial cases referred to the Department of Justice (DOJ). EPA works closely with states (e.g., in the joint development of cases) as well as with tribes and other federal agencies to implement enforcement programs. Civil enforcement actions serve a number of important goals such as returning violators to compliance, eliminating or preventing environmental harm, deterring the violator from future violations and others from misconduct, and preserving a level playing field for responsible companies that work hard to abide by the law. The agency puts an emphasis on those actions that reduce the  most significant risks to human health and the environment; and it has extensive consultation with states and other stakeholders on the determination of risk-based priorities.         The OCE, within the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, and its regional counterparts, is charged with the development, litigation, and settlement of administrative and civil judicial cases against violators of the environmental laws pursuant to federal environmental statutes. These include the Clean Water Act (CWA); Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA); Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuary Act (MPRSA); Clean Air Act (CAA); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); Oil Pollution Act (OPA); Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); Federal Facility Compliance Act (FFCA); Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA); Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA); Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA); and Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act (Battery Act).
The OCE Mission Support contractors provide analytical, technical, and administrative support services to OCE and other EPA offices, regions, states, U.S. territories, and tribes. Major activities can include case development and settlement negotiation strategies support; developing management controls and data systems for assisting with enforcement of, and monitoring compliance with, all national enforcement initiatives and programs; targeting, developing, and implementing compliance assurance activities to monitor and improve compliance of regulated pollution sources; ensuring effective enforcement of environmental requirements; compliance monitoring including on-site inspections and investigations of pollution sources; motivating the regulated community to voluntarily discover, disclose, and correct violations; developing and implementing, in association with the National Enforcement Training Institute (NETI), enforcement related training and workshops; monitoring and enfo rcing federal, and federally-authorized, state programs; and providing support to Regions, states, territories, tribes, and other regulatory authorities. 
These requirements are perpetual in that there is no foreseeable ?end date? when these services will not be required by the agency. The maximum estimated value for the three month extension of both contracts is $1,400,000 ($700,000 each). Each option period (one month) is estimated at $200,000 per contract. This estimate is based on the average spend per invoice period, as well as the time of year of the extension, certain inspections which are done more frequently in the spring/summer time, the amount of the current ongoing work, and the slowdown in work as we have approached ceiling and funding capacity.
4. AN IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1:  only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.
5. A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTORS? UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED. The contractors listed under Section Two of this document are currently providing support for the requirement. This is ongoing work, the majority of which is for case and settlement negotiations support and inspections. Until the follow-on contract(s) are awarded, Leidos and ERG are the only sources that possess the ability to perform the EPA requirement in a timely, uninterrupted, and cost-effective manner.
Cases and negotiations are initiated under single or multiple EPA statutes. Most cases or negotiations involve confidential business information (CBI) and the contractors are allowed access to this CBI. There are various requirements under the different statutes for access to CBI, with TSCA and RCRA being the most stringent. Currently, both contractors have work assignments under which they must access TSCA and/or RCRA CBI. Contractors have to be certified to receive these types of CBI. Currently Leidos and ERG both have employees that have been approved to receive such CBI under the OCE mission contracts. Employees have to go through a testing process for both TSCA and RCRA CBI as well as annual refresher training for TSCA CBI. Also, both contractors have a required EPA approved TSCA CBI room at their facility.
When new contract awards are made, the TSCA and RCRA CBI requirements require an announcement in the Federal Register stating that the awardee will be allowed access to TSCA and RCRA CBI. This requirement allows time for businesses to respond to the announcement. Meeting all of the TSCA and RCRA CBI requirements ? announcement period in the Federal Register, approval of employees to access the CBI, and the creation and approval of a TSCA CBI room would take a minimum of 60 days to complete. An open competition to compete the extension period would cause unnecessary and damaging delay and costs, and would be impossible to implement with the TSCA and RCRA CBI requirements. 
In addition, inspectors need to be credentialed by EPA to conduct inspections under the aforementioned statutes (see Section Three). Credentialing requirements include having the inspectors complete specialized courses as well on the job training for each statute they are credentialed to inspect under, being trained in EPA?s Safety and Health requirements, and passing a moderate background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management. Both current contractors have credentialed inspectors and have been trained in the requisite EPA requirements which will ensure uninterrupted support in compliance inspections.
Because the current contractors have staff already approved by EPA to access TSCA and RCRA CBI, an EPA approved TSCA CBI room, and inspectors that have EPA issued credentials, they are the only contractors that can continue the current work being done under each contract. Also, OCE?s procurement initiation notice had required a two month overlap between the current contracts and any new contract(s) to allow time for the CBI and inspector requirements to be met while current work continued. 
6.  A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS OR WILL BE PUBLICIZED AS REQUIRED BY SUBPART 5.2 AND, IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER 5.202 APPLIES. As required by FAR Part 5.2, a notice of the intent to extend the two current OCE Mission contracts was publicized in FedBizOpps on February 26, 2015 (postings:  Extension of EP-W-09-032 and Extension of EP-W-09-033).
7.   A DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE. At the respective times of award, the Government determined that the cost plus fixed fee dollar values of the OCE contracts were fair and reasonable. The respective extensions to the contracts are for three months from April 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015. If the option periods are needed (six one-month option periods), they will extend the contract end dates up to December 31, 2015. The estimated cost of the extensions is based on previous invoiced amounts and direct and indirect billing rates that have already been determined to be fair and reasonable.  Therefore, the Contracting Officer hereby determines that the anticipated cost to the Government for the extensions is fair and reasonable.   
8. A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED. Market research was not conducted for this action as doing so was not relevant to the contract extensions. Extensive market research was conducted during the pre-solicitation phases of both the previous and current acquisition. 
9. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed price contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The Government intends to award to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) at Five Moore Drive, RTP, NC 27709 for the antiviral medicine Zanamivir (trade name Relenza). <br /><br />DHS, Office of Health Affairs (OHA), requires this antiviral medicine for the DHS Antiviral Stockpile for pandemic and avian influenza preparedness. The stockpile is needed in order to have a readily available supply of medicine to protect DHS personnel in the event of a pandemic to ensure the continuity of its essential services and overall critical mission. The medicine must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration and demonstrated by the Centers for Disease Control to be effective in treating Influenza A, H1N1 Influenza and H5N1 Avian Influenza. Market research has shown that no other known contractors presently exist who could get the necessary CDC/FDA approvals to produce the product in sufficient quantities and deliver it in time to meet the current requirement.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action. If parties choose to respond, any cost associated with preparation and submission of data or any other cost incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government. The point of contact for this purchase is listed below. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br /><br />The ordering period of the resulting contract will include a 12-month base and four (4) 12-month options.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address P.O. Box 190022, North Charleston SC 29419-9022  Description: Request for Information (RFI)  USMC Intelligence Analysis System Advanced Analytics Capability  DUE: 5/8/2015  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) Atlantic, Expeditionary Intelligence Solutions Portfolio, Distributed Common Ground Systems (DCGS) Marine Corps Integrated Product Team, Intelligence Analysis System (IAS) program is seeking information on commercial products that offer advanced analytics capabilities. Once eligible products are identified, additional information will be requested.  System Need Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) intelligence analysts require a working environment where they can collect and organize data from disparate sources, conduct analysis of data, which may require visualizations of data, and disseminate relevant intelligence information to tactical operators in support of missions.  Initial Data Population A capability is required to Extract Load Transform (ELT) multiple-intelligence data stores into one (1) data repository. The baseline-data ontology will be derived from the Modernized Integrated Data Base (MIDB) and the U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance-Enterprise (MCISR-E) ontology. The new database must accept this ontology and use open-architecture standards to allow for quick integration of new data sources, both structured and unstructured.  System Functions The desired system must allow the analyst to execute each function associated with Planning and Direction, Acquiring Data, Processing and Exploitation, Production, and sharing Data, Information, and Intelligence, in accordance with Marine Corps Warfighting Publication 21, Intelligence Operations.  The following sections describe each high-level function required:  1. Planning and Direction A capability is needed to assist the analyst in refining data pertinent to the operational environment, both conventional and unconventional, and must provide the ability to view information in a format that is easily understood. Some examples are map/charts/graphs/timelines/link charts, etc. This system must help the analyst identify gaps in the dataset and develop intelligence requirements that can be tracked within the system. The system should use predictive analytics and machine-learning to assist the analyst.  2. Acquire Data (Aggregating) The acquiring data phase encompasses assembling information from a network or disconnected internal and external data sources. The solution will allow data to be received by electronic message, automated ingestion using a rich set of Application Programming Interfaces/Software Development Kits (APIs/SDKs), such as audio, visual, and written data. At the time of data aggregation, the system must normalize the data into the ontology/system standards. The analyst needs the capability to receive, retrieve, and store data for local manipulation, tagging and sharing.  3. Processing and Exploitation Processing and exploitation involves the conversion of collected data into information suitable for the production of intelligence. Processing is largely a technical function that does not add meaning to the data, but is necessary to convert the data into a form that people understand. When resources are required to accomplish the processing and exploitation phase, it is crucial that processing requirements be prioritized. An advanced analytics capability would allow the intelligence analyst to locate data stored within the database, using simple searches for entities and documents. It will also allow for geospatial, temporal searches by data range, and complex algorithms. The analyst should be able to filter results based on data attributes defined within the ontology. An advanced analytics capability would support several types of terrain analysis. Terrain analysis includes, but is not limited to line of sight, terrain masking, and mobility studies. Pattern/trend analysis identifies common attribute values, social relationships, geospatial significance, and or temporal significance. Advanced analytics would provide the capability to analyze vast amounts of data to determine organizational structure, key leadership, support networks, social networking, and operational patterns. Cultural/socioeconomic graphics give the analyst a capability to show how entities are related and affect the social structures of an area. Geospatial analysis allows an analyst to combine multiple data layers on a map to obtain a complete picture of the area. Data layers include digital elevation, imagery, overlay graphics, Track Management System (TMS) tracks and other entities stored in the database. Advanced analytics supports tagging, creates new objects, associations and potential outcomes based on automated processes, and displays quantitative and qualitative results to allow the manual manipulation and approval by the analyst. The system must take into account subjective probability and confidence.  4. Production Production involves the evaluation, interpretation, integration, analysis, and synthesis of new and existing information to support or disprove a hypothesis presented. The capability should allow the intelligence analyst to manipulate and display data via maps, charts, reports, lists, timelines and temporal wheels. The intelligence analyst needs a local workspace to create and modify entities and associations that are not publicly visible to others until approved for release. The output of this work needs to be consolidated into a user-defined product. An automated mechanism is needed to capture and report changes to the data, such as documents uploaded, data enriched, or products created or published. This mechanism also needs to allow the analyst the ability to filter the changes and query for changes within a particular timeframe. This should be available at all times to support intelligence analysts as they rotate and prepare for shifts.  5. Share Data and Intelligence Sharing data and information is the timely conveyance of intelligence to users via reporting or dissemination. Dissemination must be planned and supervised to allow for updating the Common Operating Picture (COP) and to pull all available data sources for enrichment. Enriched data must be shared for federated analysis and command and control programs of record to all, for sharing geo-located data via Track Management Service (TMS). The Advanced Analytics Capability must allow the intelligence analyst to share data and intelligence by sending it thru message, export or print, disseminating to adjacent or lower units, replicate/publishing to the database for retrieval by adjacent, higher, or lower units, or to formally report them to higher entities.  Hardware Constraints This advanced analytics capability must operate on existing IAS Family of Systems (FoS) hardware suites. The IAS FoS tiered architecture allows for the system to be scalable from a single, stand-alone, portable workstation (Tier III); to a multi-user, online, moveable, intermediate suite (Tier II); to a multi-station, real time, service-wide, intelligence-communications link (Tier I).  The suggested solution must operate within a VMware ESXi virtual environment and fit within the following constraints:  Tier I: - System must use no more than 10 CPU Cores - System must use no more than 328 GB RAM - System shall not exceed more than 100TB of physical hard drive space Tier II: - System must use no more than 19 CPU Cores - System must use no more than 432 GB RAM - System shall not exceed more than 49TB of physical hard-drive space Tier III: - System must use no more than 4 CPU Cores - System must use no more than 8 GB RAM - System shall not exceed more than 750GB of physical hard-drive space  Requested Information Respondents are requested to address the following questions with detailed information sufficient to inform requirements analysis prior to future procurement actions. The conditions under which the software will be displayed is described in Appendix A (USMC Tactical Intelligence Use Case).  1. Has this capability been fielded or employed by any other federal agency? 2. What is the estimated Technical Maturity Level (TRL1-9) of the capability in its currently available form? 3. Is this capability available via GSA schedule, ESI, Blanket Contract Agreements (BPA)? 4. Describe the Licensing Structure for this capability. 5.

The Government DOES NOT intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  E-mail your non-technical, contract-related questions to the Contract Specialist at shannon.britt@navy.mil  ______________Appendix A_______________   Scenario Upon receipt of a mission from Higher Command, a Commander drafts an operational plan (OPLAN). From this OPLAN, all subordinate-staff sections, notably the intelligence staff, begin the process of mission analysis. The analyst works within a Collect Process Analyze Disseminate (CPAD) framework for the majority of the work. The most common type of work done by the analyst is outlined below.  RFI The analyst receives a request to begin collecting data regarding a specific RFI. The intelligence analyst begins using the various IAS software applications to gain all relevant data on the topic. The analyst also sends out requests to additional USMC analytic and collections entities to provide all relevant data on the topic, and if needed, requests assistance from national-level entities. The analyst constantly reviews the incoming data to ensure applicability, confidence, and accuracy. The analyst then compiles information-derived-collection efforts to begin analysis and create a product that answers the RFI. The analyst and approving authority authorizes the release of that product and exports or saves the final product for dissemination to intelligence consumers and other intelligence systems. The analyst always retains the ability to review and update information, as required by the mission or events. The analyst then disseminates the product. The analyst retains the capability to search based upon all published RFIs as well as completed (published) products. The current system requires the analyst to search using outside databases and programs that are not contained within the IAS. The system does not provide the ability to track and view the progress of RFIs and other requests made. The proposed solution should allow the analyst to query data that is organic to the IAS prior to going to outside resources and should contain a RFI workflow process which allows the Supervisor, Analyst and the consumer the ability to view the process of the request.  Targeting The analyst begins working thru an already well-defined target package template, according to their unit Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). The template typically includes recent reporting on the target, biographical information on the target, a graphic or image of the target, target associations, effects-analysis documents, recommended-effects means, and video or audio attachments. The analyst selects data records and designates them into a target-package product, for approval. The targeting list and package are constantly updated with mapping capability to show where the target was last reported. The analyst has the capability to move data freely between products (targeting lists), collected information, RFIs, tactical reporting, and published products, as detailed below. The current system requires the analyst to create the template, which takes time away from the analysis needed on the possible target. The proposed solution should present the analyst with a targeting section that is only accessible to individuals with the correct permissions. The section should include a target-package template and a baseball-card template that are preset, but should allow the analyst to make changes to the template to conform to SOP.  Tactical Reporting When the analyst receives urgent tactical reporting in real time, the analyst annotates in the INTEL JOURNAL (outlined below), the key information from the report (Ref, MCRP 2-25A) and inputs that information into the advanced analytics capability database for use within the CPAD process. The analyst has the ability to later filter and search for Intel reports based on text-search logic, time, or location. Tactical reporting may also take the form of a message received or chat group monitored as an operation is underway, directly following completion of the mission, or during after-action-review debriefing. The reports received from chat messages and email conversations are entered by the analyst into the advanced analytics capability database using the proper report format located in the advanced analytics capability reporting tool. The current system requires the analyst to wait for the information to be placed into the system by outside entities. It is not local to the IAS system. This creates a gap in actionable intelligence while the analyst waits for the report to be emailed or placed into a larger database that can be searched to locate the report. Currently, there is no available database within the IAS system. The proposed solution should give the analyst the ability to enter tactical reports into the database as information is received from different sources. The solution should provide the analyst with easy-to-fill-in templates for each of the report types, in accordance with the format found in the USMC MCRP 2-25A. Reconnaissance Reports Guide.  MIDB Interaction Advanced analytics capability provides a means to locally work data and information into intelligence for eventual integration with MIDB. MIDB is the current DoD source of Nationally Validated Military Information. The analyst has the capability to search and select records through the COP, found on the IAS Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J)-Integrated Imagery and Intelligence (I3) baseline. The analyst has the ability, upon leadership validation to nominate that record (e.

<DESC><p>This "<strong>Request for Information "</strong> is<strong> NOT </strong>a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotatioins.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The purpose of this RFI is to solicit technology experimentation candidates from Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations, private industry, and academia for inclusion in future experimentation events coordinated by the U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). USSOCOM invites industry, academia, individuals, and Government labs to submit technology experimentation nominations addressing innovative technologies leading to possible Government/Industry collaboration for development of USSOCOM technology capabilities. The goal is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter, while providing participants with the opportunity to gain Special Operations Forces (SOF) insight/perspective on participant technologies.</p>
<p>SOF experimentation will explore emerging technologies, technical applications, and their potential to provide solutions for future SOF capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>This RFI is for TE 15-4:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp; Date: 3-7 August 2015<br />&nbsp; -&nbsp; Theme: SOF Combat Swimmer/Diver<br />&nbsp; -&nbsp; Location: Naval Amphibious Base, Coronado, CA </strong></p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong>:<br />1. USSOCOM technology experimentation events provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel to determine how their technology development efforts and ideas may support or enhance SOF capability needs. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between Government, academia, and industry to promote the identification and assessment of emerging and mature technologies.</p>
<p>2. The <strong>deadline for nomination package(s) is 15 May, 2015 at 12:00 Noon EST.</strong>After review of the TE nomination submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to demonstrate their technologies at the USSOCOM sponsored event. <strong>Experiments will be conducted from 3 through 7 August, 2015 at Naval Amphibious Base, Coronado, CA</strong>and will explore emerging technology solutions and revolutionary improvements in relevant technologies. Materiel solutions brought to the event should be between a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 and 6. Proposed experiments may be between a half day and two days in duration and may be conducted in unimproved expeditionary-like conditions. There is no intention on the part of USSOCOM to purchase or procure equipment based solely on participation in TE.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Experimentation Focus:</strong>The primary intent of this event is to highlight technologies that support the capabilities of the SOF Combat Swimmers/Divers in the water column.<br /><br /><strong>***See Attachment 1, RFI TE 15-4 DCB 3 Apr 2015 for the complete RFI, Topic Areas of Interest, Submission Details, and future Technical Events planned.****<br /><br />NOTE: Attachment 4, Vendor Loan Agreement - is not to be completed until requested.</strong></p>

<DESC>Please see attached RFQ. <br /><br />THIS IS SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES <br /><br />This will be a Firm Fixed Price purchase order.
<p>Please email the Technical and Business proposals to: mbartkevicius@cdc.gov</p>
<p>Questions may be submitted until:<br />04/13/2015 by1:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Proposal must be submitted by (Includes separate Technical and Business Proposal):<br />04/20/2015 by1:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Title: Questing Attributes of Ticks as Determined by Relative Time, Temperature, and Precipitation</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose/goal of this study is to determine the effects of time (daylight), temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation (rain events) on questing Ixodes scapularis (blacklegged tick) and Amblyomma americanum (lone-star tick). These factors ultimately affect the presence and questing behavior of these tick species and will allow investigators to make recommendations on intervention-based strategies for tick control (applications of acaricides) based on peak questing times and seasonality. These variables are needed to account for efficacy of deployed interventions, spatial distribution of ticks, and human tick encounters when determining entomologic risk.<br /><br />SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The vendor shall furnish all labor, materials and equipment necessary to evaluate questing attributes of blacklegged ticks and lone-star ticks as determined by relative time, temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Vendor will also determine spatial distribution of ticks on residential properties - particularly within versus outside of areas on a residential property that would be included in a barrier spray application focusing on the lawn/wood edge - via flagging and/or tick-drag sampling methods. Vendor will provide weekly reports and perform statistical analysis. All data will be sent to CDC/NCEZID/DVBD, Fort Collins, CO.</p>
<p>TASKS TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>1) Vendor will compare questing tick behavior in both forested/natural settings (areas with a minimum of &gt; 0.1 tick/m2 and sufficient historical tick sampling data) as well as residential areas.</p>
<p>2) Data loggers will be set out at predetermined areas to record temperature and humidity. Targeted areas will include: centrally located forested sites, near residences, high-traffic areas, maintained landscape, ecotone, forested-natural areas, as well as small mammal reservoir-targeted habitat.</p>
<p>3) An aerial tripod mounted weather station will be centrally located at each of the two designated test areas (residential and forested/natural area). These units will remotely provide investigators the ability to record relative time, temperature, humidity, wind speed, barometric pressure, and measureable precipitation. This data will be used to make comparisons of tick collections on/near location of weather stations and data loggers.</p>
<p>4) Flagging and/or tick-drag sampling of all areas will be conducted according to recorded captured weather information and comparisons made among weather events, among tick species, and tick life stages for the following:</p>
<p>-Time of day<br />-Wind speed<br />-Relative humidity<br />-Temperature<br />-Dry weather vs post-rain event</p>

<p>The U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration intends to issue a sole-source modification to Summer Productions Inc. under Contract No. HHSF223201400134C. The estimated amount of this modification is around $63,504.00 and it will extend the contract completion date by six months. The above contract at $175,271.00 was awarded to Summer Productions Inc. on September 18, 2014 through FDA's Broad Agency Announcement for research and development to support regulatory science and innovation, solicitation number FDABAA-13-00119. The purpose of the contract was to understand the FDA's brand awareness among physicians; to understand how physicians access information from the FDA and what the preferred strategies are for physicians to receive regulatory and scientific information from the agency; to evaluate the effectiveness of information related to the FDA and drugs that physicians receive from the agency; and to recommend improvements in the strategies and platforms that the FDA uses to communicate to physicians</p>
<p>Purpose of Modification:</p>
<p>In the original statement of work, the offeror proposed the production, dissemination, and review of physician focus groups to learn about their interactions with CDER and their understanding of its regulatory mission. Upon further review of its original statement of work and research plan, one additional focus group with physicians in New York and three additional focus groups comprised of pharmacists are needed.</p>
<p>The purpose of adding an additional focus group of physicians in New York is to capture a more complete and representative view of physician opinion across the United States. As the most populated city in the United States with a large diverse medical practice, New York could offer insights unique to every other city the offeror has previously sampled.</p>
<p>The purpose of adding pharmacist focus groups is to augment the information that has already been gleaned from the physician groups. The physician focus groups have helped FDA understand how different healthcare professionals access information differently. The offeror's preliminary findings show that some of FDA materials and assets used with physicians may be targeted more towards pharmacists in their practice. This has allowed the offeror to develop a hypothesis that other health prescribers, especially pharmacists, access the Agency's regulatory information in different ways. Adding three pharmacist groups will ensure that FDA understands how it communicates to an overlooked partner of the healthcare continuum.</p>
<p>Award will be made in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements using Simplified Acquisition Procedures per FAR Part 13.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement within Seven calendar days after the publication of this synopsis which shall be considered by the agency. Responses received after Seven days or without the required information may not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete as a result of information received is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. For information concerning this acquisition, contact Natalie Mitchell, Contract Specialist at Natalie.Mitchell@fda.hhs.gov</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number is FDA-SOL-1145520. This solicitation is issued as a, Total Small Business Set Aside in accordance with the SBA Non-Manufacture Rule waiver dated January 1, 2015, Request for Quote (RFQ), using the Simplified Acquisitions Procedures of FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. <br />The solicitation documented and incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) FAC 2005-80, Effective 02 Mar 2015.<br />The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is - 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 in number of employees.<br />The US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) intends to issue a Commercial Item Firm Fixed-Price purchase order that meets the following specifications below. Please submit all quotes to be valid until September 30, 2015.<br />SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTS<br />The contractor shall fill out the following pricing sheet:<br />CLIN Description Qty Unit<br />of Issue Price<br />0001 Agilent 1290 Infinity UHPLC System 3 EA $<br /><br />Total Amount <br />$</p>
<p>I. Background/Intro<br />The Mycotoxin Group in the Southeast Regional Laboratory (SRL) analyzes various grains, nuts and milk commodities for toxic metabolites produced by certain fungi that can infect and proliferate on various agricultural commodities in the field and/or during storage. SRL serves as the national servicing lab for all districts for domestic aflatoxin testing. The increase in sample load for FY15 is justification for the need a Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) system to analyze large volume of samples in less time would greatly increase sample throughput and decrease sample turn-around times. The demand for multi-residue analyses would require the use of this UHPLC system since it employs a dual detection system for both fluorescence and diode array detection. <br />II. Minimum Salient Characteristics<br />All of the following system requirements are minimum requirements. Equivalent requirements that differ from these minimum requirements must be justified by the proposing vendor and evaluated by the FCC prior to purchase.</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action<br />is precluded. (ii) Examples.<br /><br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.<br />&sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.<br />&sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with<br />the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p><br />(c)</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart<br />42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct<br />these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart<br />204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT<br />PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU,<br />Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.<br /><br />This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p><br />(xv) Brand Justification:</p>
<p>Bromium vSentry software creates a specific environment isolated down to the hardware which mimics a singular system which prevents the malware from escaping. The software provides a micro virtualization (also referred to as a hardware isolation virtualization) capability which uses hardware level isolation to stop targeted attacks including zero day exploits, commonly considered undetectable, from successfully penetrating Department systems. The software utilizes micro-virtualization for the most common untrusted tasks and threat vectors, including browsing the internet, downloading documents, opening email attachments, and launching files from authorized USB/removable storage devices. This software is currently in use by the Department and a transition to another system could cause a loss or damage to data.</p>

All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopters Incorporated (Cage Code 3GSZ1).  Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>The Contractor shall make reasonable arrangements with the Government or Contractors of the Government, as shall have been identified and authorized by the Contracting Officer, to be given admission to the Contractor's facilities and access to the vessel(s) and to office space, work areas, storage or shop areas, or other facilities and services, necessary for the performance of their respective responsibilities and reasonable to their performance.

<p>(3) CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>

In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p>(4) INSPECTIONS</p>
<p>Except as specified elsewhere, the U.S. Coast Guard shall rely on the contractor to accomplish all inspection and testing needed to ensure that the work conforms to contract quality requirements. <br />Records of all inspection work by the contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the term of this contract and for such longer period as may be specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>The name and telephone number of the U.S. Coast Guard Inspector will be provided after the award of a contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(5) MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed.</p>
<p>2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the contractor at time of award.

Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a, and b) above shall be reported on the report.

A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard.

<p>(6) GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a <br />Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an MLCA 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), U.S. Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC) has a project that requires genotyping cattle for large numbers of markers concordant with current genotypes in the population. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 (current as of FAC 2001-24), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The NAICS is 541380. The Solicitation number AG6538S150039 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The description of items and clauses incorporated in this synopsis/solicitation are applicable to this procurement and will be incorporated into any resultant purchase order. <br />The goal of this project is to determine genomic associations of markers with cattle phenotypes for feed intake, weight gain, and susceptibility to bovine respiratory disease complex.  The cattle population is a subset of the germplasm evaluation program, a large beef cattle resource herd, which has been extensively genotyped for markers on the Illumina BovineHD genotyping array.  In order for these ungenotyped animals to have utility through imputation techniques, these animals must be genotyped for a broad marker set spanning the entire genome using a subset of markers from the Illumina BovineHD.  Additional bulls (parents of these animals) will also need to be genotyped using the Illumina BovineHD genotyping array.<br />These markers can be used in selection programs to reduce the increase the efficiency of gain for steer and heifers during high growth periods and to reduce the incidence of bovine respiratory disease complex. The work supports the Center's missions of increasing the production efficiency of safe, high-quality food products.
<p>Technical Requirements:<br />The provider must genotype DNA from 2437 animals for a subset of markers found on the current Illumina BovineHD(SNP770K) BeadChip&reg;.  We expect the subset to be a panel of 20,000 to 30,000 markers with approximately equal spacing across all bovine chromosomes. In addition, the provider will genotyped DNA for 240 sires of these animals for the identical marker set the currently exists on the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip&reg;.  Finally, the provider will genotype a minimum of 25 and a maximum of 75 animals for a subset of markers found on the current Illumina BovineHD BeadChip&reg;.  We expect this second subset of markers to be a panel of 75,000 or 150,000 markers with approximately equal spacing across all bovine chromosomes.  All resulting genotypes must be returned to USMARC.  All data needs to be available for USMARC download by July 1, 2015.</p>
<p>SAM: Vendor must be registered in the System for Award Management prior to the award of the contract. You may register by going to www.sam.gov. You will need to your Tax ID, Duns Number, Bradstreet number and banking information.</p>
<p>PAYMENT: Any award made under this solicitation is subject to 31 CFR Part 208 which requires all payments made by the government to be made by electronic funds transfer. Please note on your proposal if you will accept a government purchase (VISA) card.</p>
<p>This is a Buy Best Value acquisition. The Government will award a Purchase Order resulting from this Request for Quotes to the responsible offeror whose quote is conforming to the solicitation and represents the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD<br />1.

The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</span></span></p>

An offer may be determined un-awardable if its price is evaluated to be unfair or unreasonable. Comparison of proposed prices received in response to this solicitation is the preferred and intended price analysis technique. Other techniques and procedures, if deemed necessary, may be used to ensure a fair and reasonable price, to include but not limited to the following: a comparison of all offerors' proposed labor rates, comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial prices for the same or similar services.</span></span></li>

  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 
  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>************************************************************<br />National Library of Medicine Requirement for "V" Cradle Digital Imaging System</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine needs a dual-camera adjustable "V" cradle imaging system to capture images of rare books and other print material, including bound volumes up to 6" thick with page dimensions up to 17" X 24", at a minimum 400 ppi (non-interpolated), without extensive manual adjustment and pose no risk of damage to the items being scanned. Ergonomic considerations are of high importance. The device shall allow the operator to sit while working and complete image capture tasks without undue stress associated with repetitive turning or reaching beyond what is necessary to position books in the cradle and turn pages. The system shall include LED lighting that does not shine directly into the operator's eyes or subject the operator to intense glare. A "V"-shaped non- reflective glass platen shall be provided to secure materials for imaging. Operator control of the platen shall be both manual and mechanical (pneumatic or hydraulic) to mitigate risk of either operator injury or damage to items being digitized. Image resolution shall be verifiable using a device calibration target and analysis software system that can analyze images of the target according to the latest version of Federal Agencies Digitization Guidelines Initiative (FADGI) specifications. The imaging system shall be capable of producing images that meet current FADGI quality benchmarks for capture at a minimum of 400 and up to 600 ppi, and include software that enables the operator to view captured images on a monitor in the correct orientation without additional adjustment. The Library shall be able to configure automated transfer of images created using this system into docWorks image processing software. The imaging system housing shall make it possible to position the monitor where it can be easily viewed by the operator. The software shall support sRGB color space and be capable of providing uncompressed 24-bit color TIFF files that conform to ISO 12234-2. System shall include ongoing technical support and maintenance, including recalibration, replacement of worn or defective parts and software upgrades as needed.</p>

Brothers Elizabeth City, NC 27909 NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>For reference see attached a .pdf version of the RFI prior to completion at survey monkey.</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) questionnaire being conducted in conjunction with U.S. Air Force (USAF) Special Notice (capabilities session) posted on 30 January 2015 to FedBizOpps (FBO) under Solicitation Number FA8056-15-R-0001, for USAF Fire Emergency Services Personal Protective Equipment (FES-PPE).</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=65eb7abb3064e8936d884a698913742a&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=65eb7abb3064e8936d884a698913742a&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0</a>)</p>
<p>The purpose of this questionnaire is to gain insight into the products and suppliers/manufacturers which can meet the USAF requirements for FES-PPE. Nothing in the questionnaire implies a government obligation to implement.</p>
<p>This questionnaire is similar to an RFI released in February 2015 prior to the capabilities sessions. Significant changes are included here. Please complete the entire questionnaire. Note - some questions may not apply to your company.</p>
<p>Note: If you answer these questions pertaining to products you did not manufacture, the Government requires you confirm your answers with your manufacture(s) prior to responding.</p>
<p>The questionnaire consists of 18 pages, 41 questions in total and may require up to 2 hours to complete. Questions with an asterisk (*) are required to be answered. Please complete this survey by COB Thursday, 23 April 2015. To advance the survey, click the "Next" button. To go back a page, click the "Prev" button. Do not use your internet browser icons to navigate the survey. If necessary, you may exit the questionnaire while in process and resume on the same page at a later time. Please ensure you use the same computer and have cookies enabled.</p>
<p>The information provided here is subject to change. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned. We highly encourage all interested parties to provide a complete and thorough response; however not responding will not preclude participation should a formal solicitation be released at a later date. Any questions should be directed to AFICA.PPE@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>These questions are asked for market research purposes in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation 10.002. The only person authorized to bind the Government is the Contracting Officer. Under no circumstances will the Government be bound by an action or statement in this survey. Any proprietary information provided to the Government will not be released to the public.</p>

<DESC>The release of the Final Request for Proposal (RFP) has been delayed.&nbsp; The USG expects to release the final RFP on or about 10 April 2015.<br /><br />******************************************************************************<br /><br /><br /><br />Please see attached document entitled "Pre-Proposal Conference Notice" scheduled for 15 April 2015; registration due 10 April 2015.<br /><br />****************************************************************<br /><br />Please see attached Pre-Solicitation Notice dated 9 March 2015.<br /><br /><br />****************************************************************<br /><br /><br />To better understand the impact of PROS business processes upon potential offerors, the USG invites interested parties to respond to the question below:
<p><br />The current PROS contract requires vendor quotes to be valid for 60 days. There are instances when vendor quotes are higher than anticipated, forcing the FMS customer to obtain additional funding and potentially resulting in a request for the vendor to extend the timeframe of their quote. Anecdotal data suggests that it may require FMS customers more than 60 days to amend their case in order to add funding. To account for this possibility, the USG is considering revising the vendor quote validity requirement from 60 to 90 days. Please identify what impacts, if any, this revision would have upon your proposal.</p>
<p><br />Responses to this question should be submitted in writing to Ms. Tamara Tobe, Contract Specialist, at tamara.tobe@us.af.mil by 12:00pm Eastern on Friday, February 27. Non-responses will not negatively impact an offeror's eligibility.</p>

<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">****************************************************************<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Sources Sought Synopsis:<br />THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTE. </span>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation (AFSAC) Directorate located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base OH anticipates a competitive acquisition to provide acquisition services for non-standard and difficult to purchase standard items in support of foreign military sales. This tri-service contract will support FMS Air Force, Navy and Army requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contract Effort Description: The Parts Repair Ordering System (PROS) Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. The contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor's performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing, quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer. The PROS program goal is to provide "one stop shopping" for the FMS country. The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ), period of performance June 2012 - June 2017 (3-year base period with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), firm fixed price and cost reimbursable (task orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and an Objective Performance Incentive (OPI) . NOTE: The contemplated period of performance for this acquisition is 5-7 years, with a 3-6 month ramp up period to create and implement a procurement software system capable of interfacing with AFSAC's Security Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS), along with a logistics transition phase between the current and subsequent contractor. Government requests industry feedback on contemplated Period of Performance (PoP) and suggested ramp up period required in order for USG to solicit realistic time frames.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Historical Environment: Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The 90+ plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure rates. The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate computations make predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) supported on this contract are waived by the USAF for supply action usually due to inability to meet an established need date. However, the managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved sources. Approximately 22,000 supply requisitions and 4,500 maintenance requisitions are issued per year. Approximately 80% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being maintenance and task orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service. The majority of the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service. The successful bidder for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of the contract. The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized) sources of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and OPI. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs). This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have been completed several years before. The successful bidder shall be advised to make arrangements to address this potential liability. <br />NOTE: The SDR process has been problematic in previous contracts. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract value amount is pass-through costs for procuring required parts and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Desirable Features: Competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance; current contract contains a 90% effective competition rate. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings - best available price - minimizing participation fees, turn-around time - shortest possible lead-time - lead-time from after receipt of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Small business and other than small business participation is encouraged. Each company responding should indicate their business size in relation to the stated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code size standard. The NAICS assigned to this acquisition is 541614, "Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting", with a size standard of $15M. Your response must also indicate all socio-economic small business categories for which you qualify; small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), woman-owned, economically disadvantaged women-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, and HUBZone. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) database to be awarded a DOD contract. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. If you are a Small Business and you intend to subcontract a portion of this effort, please explain in your response how you intend to meet the 50% performance requirement. Additionally, firms having GSA schedules should indicate their GSA schedule number in their responses.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capabilities Package. All interested firms should submit capability packages that outline their capability to provide the required purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. Additionally, interested firms should specifically state how they intend to meet the 3-6 month ramp up after contract award and discuss their capability to be fully operational within that time frame. Also, include any comments/suggestions on structuring SDR liability and resolution. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience and/or capabilities in all areas should be provided. Recent, relevant experience is defined as performance of the same or similar work within the past three (3) years. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. The response must not exceed 10 pages. Submit capabilities packages via e-mail to Tammy Tobe; tamara.tobe@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "Parts Ordering Repair Service-PROS." If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachments. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, or .xls documents are attached to your email.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions related to this sources sought synopsis must be submitted via e-mail to the person indicated above NLT COB (Monday, 28 July 2014.) No further questions will be entertained after that date.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN COB Monday, 18 August 2014.<br />The PROS Program Management Office (PMO) will be hosting an Industry Days event for all interested parties. Information about Industry Days will be posted as a separate notice.</span></p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is post questions and answers as follows: <br>  <br> Question:  Please advise if the 15+ years experience in DOD source selections may be combined with other U.S. government agency experience. For example, may a combination of source selection/evaluation support to FEMA, Department of Homeland Security, and/or Department of Transportation - in addition to DOD - be acceptable to meet the requirements of the subject effort? <br>  <br> Answer:  The years of experience cannot be combined with other U.S. Government agencies.  Acquisitions are different for military items and DoD has its own source selection guidance.  <br>  <br>  <br> All other terms remain the same.

<DESC>This is an announcement by the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) on behalf of the Airborne, Maritime, Fixed Station (AMF) Program Office to announce updated information for the Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) Program. This announcement serves as a notification to industry of procurement of Non-Developmental Items (NDIs) to meet the requirements of the Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) system for Army Aviation platforms. SANR is intended as a two-channel, software-defined, National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 networking radio providing seamless real-time information operating in highly mobile and dynamic combat environments. SANR will provide Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS), Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) and Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) capability, offering voice and data networking and increased data throughput to Army Aviation platforms.    <br>      <br>   This announcement contains two (2) notifications for vendors interested in the SANR acquisition.    <br>      <br>   1. SANR Information Repository Content    <br>      <br>   The Government hereby advises potential industry sources having an interest in the SANR acquisition program of the availability of SANR-related technical data (documentation).    <br>      <br>   The applicable technical data (documentation) may be provided to each authorized vendor and their subcontractors, if applicable. In order to receive a copy of the technical data (documentation), vendors and their subcontractors must be authorized to have access to the Joint Tactical Networks (JTN) Information Repository (IR) AMF SANR folder. To obtain authorization, each vendor/subcontractor must complete the request for AMF SANR access available only on the JTN IR Registration website, https://ir-registration.sd.spawar.navy.mil. Vendors are encouraged to request authorization to the AMF SANR folder as soon as possible. Those vendors that do not have a properly certified Military Critical Technical Data Agreement (DD Form 2345) can start that process immediately by following the procedures documented at the JTN IR Registration website. Access to the JTN IR Registration website requires users to have a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate. For information on External Certification Authorities (ECA) vendors that are authorized to provide non-DoD personnel and contractors with PKI certificate services, please see the following website, http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/.    <br>      <br>   Authorized contractors and/or subcontractors interested in the SANR acquisition may be granted access to the AMF SANR unclassified folder on the JTN IR, but access will be allowed only after the contractor/subcontractor has completed and submitted the request for AMF SANR access and only after the DD Form 2345 information is verified by the Government. No classified information will be made available to any contractors or subcontractors via the JTN IR. Contractors and/or subcontractors requiring access to the JTN IR classified artifacts for SANR will be provided the information on a Compact Disk (CD) upon Government confirmation of clearance and approval of a need to know. The CDs will be encrypted in order to protect the data, and will be sent to the contractor's approved address for receipt of classified information. The CD recipients will need to contact the Contracting Officer, Matthew Connolly at matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil, in order to receive the CD's password to decrypt the content. All recipients of the classified artifact CD shall agree to return the CD as well as any/all copies of the Data contained on the CD in the vendor's possession as agreed between the vendor and the Government JTN office.    <br>      <br>   Important Note: All recipients of SANR related JTN IR artifacts from the previous Solicitation No. W15P7T-13-R-5005 must destroy all downloaded data, including source code, and notify in writing to Matthew Connolly at matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil. Failure to do so shall constitute a material breach of the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR) RFP Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement, paragraph (1)(a) and a rejection to access the SANR updated information under Solicitation No. W15P7T-15-R-0014.    <br>      <br>   2. Government Site Visits    <br>      <br>   The Government hereby advises potential industry sources having an interest in the SANR acquisition program of Government's interest to visit vendors' facilities that intend to produce the SANR.    <br>      <br>   The purpose of the site visit is for AMF's market survey update and to provide vendors an opportunity to demonstrate small airborne technology, the status of SANR NDI activities, and manufacturing capabilities.    <br>      <br>   Vendors interested in hosting AMF Program Office representatives at their facilities will need to contact Matthew Connolly at matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil in order to schedule the visit.

<p>THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE HEREBY ANSWERED AND ARE PART OF THIS SOLICITATION AS FOLLOWS:</p>
<p>1 - Are all items on drawing #002-3727 to be "Government Supplied"?</p>
<p>If so will the shell sections, item #2, be supplied as flat plate or will they be rolled to size?</p>

<p>Answer:</p>
<p>1. The plates in question are on 002-2936, this is what the vendor is to supply/make.</p>
<p>Drawings 002-2937(not 002-3727), 002-2938, 002-2939 &amp; 002-2940 are the pieces that are supplied by the government.</p>
<p>They are shown on 002-2936 so that the vendor will know where to weld them onto the tank they will make.</p>
<p>Everything else on 002-1936 is supplied by the vendor, not the government( shell sections, item #2, etc.).</p>
<p>From the spec,</p>

<p><br />2 - Please provide outside diameter of the tank.</p>
<p>Answer: <br /><br />Diameter is 8 feet, based on size of the rolled plates.</p>
<p>All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">The above numbered solicitation is amended as set forth below. The hour and date specified for receipt of offers is NOT extended. All other terms and conditions of the Request for Proposals (RFP) remain unchanged.</p>
<p>PURPOSE OF AMENDMENT: To answer additional questions related to the Solicitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br />The questions and answers below are focused on significant clarifying information.&nbsp; Any question from your inquiry that was not answered is due to the solicitation being clear and accurate on what is required at the completion of Phase 1, or due to the question addressing Phase 2 issues which are outside of this solicitation such as an IND.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Question 4<strong>: </strong>What is the likely regulatory jurisdiction (CDER or CDRH) that the offeror shall anticipate will manage regulation of the product?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Answer 4: The FDA stated that the primary contact for electronic cigarettes is CDER.&nbsp; This information can be found here: <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/UCM225263.pdf">http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/UCM225263.pdf</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Question 5<strong>: </strong>In the section &ldquo;<strong><em>Phase I Activities and Expected Deliverables&rdquo;</em></strong>, the solicitation states, <em>&ldquo;A DMF for the device including all liquid formulations, completed to FDA specifications (see Drug Master File: Guidelines).&rdquo;</em> &nbsp;Our understanding is that the FDA would require a Master File for Device (MAF), not a DMF.&nbsp; Please clarify.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Answer 5:&nbsp;&nbsp; The DMF is not for the device, but covers the liquid formulations and includes characterization of the aerosol generated. &nbsp;&nbsp;For Phase 1 of the solicitation, only a DMF (not an MAF) is a required deliverable. &nbsp;The DMF required is a Type II:&nbsp; Drug Substance, Drug Substance Intermediate, and Material Used in Their Preparation, or Drug Product.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Question 6: Please clarify the entity responsible for holding and maintaining the IND and DMF?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Answer 6:&nbsp; All intellectual property including patents and FDA filings will follow the standard data rights clauses. Please see page(s) 20, 23-24 of the RFP.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Question 7: Should the offeror obtain guidance concerning product characterization from the FDA as a component of the Phase 1 or Phase 2 scope of work?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Answer 7: &nbsp;Meetings with the FDA may or may not be a deliverable for a Phase 2 award, but are not a deliverable in the Phase 1 solicitation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

The proposed contract will be issued for commercial firm fixed price contract types. The period of performance for this contract will be one year, with four additional, one-year option periods from date of award, which is estimated for Oct 1, 2015. 
  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
	(1) Technical capability:
a.	Evaluation of the demonstration of the ability to deliver radiopharmaceutical STAT orders to the hospital within two (2) hours of the order being placed.

b.	Licensing:  Contractor Shall abide by (CFR) Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations, which states: A license may use for medical use only: By product material manufactured, label, packaged, and distributed in accordance with a license pursuant to the regulations in title 10, code of Federal Regulations of an Agreement State. Regents Kits that have been manufactured, labeled, packed, and distributed in accordance with approval by the commission pursuant to SS32.72 or an Agreement State under equivalent regulations for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals for medical use. 
(2) Price:  The total evaluated price of an offer will be calculated as the sum of the extended prices (unit quantity multiplied by unit price) for all Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) 0001 through 4049 for the base and option years.
Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. Technical proposals shall be evaluated by the Technical Evaluation Team to ensure offerors meet the minimum mandatory factors and standards established for this solicitation.  Technical proposals will be evaluated using an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" rating.  An acceptable rating indicates the offeror passes (or meets) minimum mandatory requirement.  An unacceptable rating indicates the offeror fails to meet minimum mandatory requirement.   A rating of unacceptable for any factor will result in an overall rating of "unacceptable" for the technical factor.   Proposals receiving a rating of "unacceptable" will be excluded from competition.  Only those proposals determined to be technically acceptable shall receive further consideration for award.  

   (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
 506-15-1-1405-0018	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER N/A
	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT:

Monitoring and advising about Methodological/empirical  advances in cognitive rehabilitation. Interpretation of group-level findings and result dissemination. Base year contract with three (3) option years.

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

Only one responsible source (FAR 6.302-1) Dr. Anthony Stringer is uniquely qualified to perform the services above. Specifically, he is board certified in Clinical Neuropsychology and has over 25 years of experience diagnosing and treating cognitive deficits.

Dr. Stringer is approved and named on the Grant for the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System to complete this study. The Grant is approved by VACO.

4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Only one responsible source (FAR 6.302-1) Dr. Anthony Stringer is uniquely qualified to perform the services above. Specifically, he is board certified in Clinical Neuropsychology and has over 25 years of experience diagnosing and treating cognitive deficits. Searches within GSA/FSS Schedules did not show this type of service available.

5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Only one responsible source (FAR 6.302-1) Dr. Anthony Stringer is uniquely qualified to perform the services.

2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

Varian Medical will provide emergency and non-emergency service repairs/replacement to the ARIA/Eclipse (Serial # H484288) equipment and software (as specified in maintenance Agreement DOR201140916-001A. The reference maintenance agreement is for the Varian Premier Assurance Essentials Maintenance Plan which carries a 97% up-time guarantee, mandatory upgrades coverage, Firmware and software upgrades coverage, comprehensive parts coverage, discounted labor rates etc. This is a full service coverage plan. The ARIA/Eclipse is the software and hardrives which run the linear accelerator used to provide treatment to cancer patients used in radiation. This is Temporary order for continuous service for the period of 4/1/2015 to 6/30/2015 while a new contract is completed for approval. 

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

Varian Medical Systems is the original equipment manufacturer.  Only Varian Medical Systems can perform the required maintenance, upgrades and repairs to this equipment.  The vendor has access to their servers with a VA national agreement to access them via VPN communication which means that they are able to log into our servers remotely and be able to resolve any software issues as well as provide software upgrades and system diagnostics. In addition, the software and hardware components make the system impossible to work on without manufacturer training and service keys.  Accordingly, Varian Medical is the only firm capable of providing the supplies and services components described in Section 2 above without the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition.

4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Currently working on a new contract with a Base Year and four (4) option years. Only Varian Medical Systems can perform the required maintenance, upgrades and repairs to this equipment since they are the manufacturer of this system.  The vendor has access to their servers with a VA national agreement to access them via VPN communication which means that they are able to log into our servers remotely and be able to resolve any software issues as well as provide software upgrades and system diagnostics for the system they designed and manufactured.

5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Robert Hijazi searched GSA advantage.gov and the internet for applicable FSS contract or an open market contractor that could provide the services and supplies required and was unable to locate one.  He also obtained a quote from Varian Medical for the proposed services so that the VA would know exactly what was covered and what was not. The Contracting Officer searched the internet and found no other vendors that could provide the services or supplies and contacted Varian Medical via phone and e-mail to verify whether the service plan was available on FSS or not.According to Donald Rubino, of Varian Medical, it is not available under any FSS contract. The contracting officer also issued an intent to sole source announcement on FBO on 12/18/2014 and only one source replied, Varian Medical.

6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>Description of Action<br />This contractual modification action is for a limited source justification award for a new modification to International Business Machines (IBM), 6300 Diagonal Highway, Boulder, CO 80301 for additional support required for the sustainment of the IBM provided training environment and continuation of support for the secure Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) between the vendor (IBM) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).<br /><br />IBM currently provides a virtual training environment for use in delivering coursework on operating the Human Resources Information System (HRIS) Shared Service Center (SSC) (a.k.a., HR Smart). IBM does not sustain this environment in between training classes. VA requires that the training environment remain active in between delivered coursework and until all deployments are complete as it could be used to re-orient trained personnel and for VA to access it to supplement IBM delivered training where and when needed during transition from the legacy system to HRIS.
<p>The TIC support requires continuance due to VA issues with installation causing delay in testing. VA experienced un-anticipated delays in delivery of hardware for installation of the TIC permanent connection at its Austin Information Technology Center (AITC). As a result, testing of the permanent connection could not be completed within the allotted time on contract. It is necessary to ensure operational status thru testing prior to live production.<br /><br />The requesting activity has an already awarded requirement for the design, development, testing, training, deployment, hosting, help desk support, and also operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) services for an enterprise Human Resources Information System (HRIS) that will replace the legacy 50+ year old Personnel Accounting and Integrated Data (PAID) which is nearing its end of life. The new system, being provided by IBM, will provide VA Human Resource (HR) Specialists with personnel action processing capabilities, and both HR Specialists and all VA employees with benefits administration and compensation management capabilities. This enterprise system will serve the entire VA and over 300,000 personnel.</p>
<p>The TIC is being installed to create a permanent, secure connection between the external host (IBM) of HRIS and VA. The TIC permits for a more efficient, effective, and reliable continuous transfer of data between the service provider and end user. It also provides for improved monitoring of data and flow of data between systems for better overall management of delivered services. Due to issues VA encountered with acquisition and installation of hardware at its own facility, it is necessary to permit the vendor (IBM) more time to complete testing the connection to confirm it is operational, which must occur prior to HRIS deployment to the VA community.</p>

<DESC>Determination for sole source to Amtex Security Inc. for Camp Guernsey Meals  <br>  <br> 1.	In Accordance With FAR 13.106-(b).  Intend to Award a sole source contract award (W912MM-15-P-0028) for $35,076.25 to Amtex Security Inc, doing business as Amtex Global Services.  Amtex Global Services has a current contract as a Food Service Contractor with the Wyoming National Guard to run and operate at Camp Guernsey DFAC.  South Dakota Army National Guard soldiers will be eating their meals at the Guernsey DFAC and lodged on Camp Guernsey also. <br>  <br> 2.	It is not feasible to have another contractor feed SDARNG soldiers.  SDARNG units will be training at different field locations thus complicating a contractor's ability to serve.  The units would also have to rearrange their missions in order to accommodate serving.  It is not practical to have two contractors serving meals out of the Guernsey DFAC. <br>

<DESC>The United States Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) Acquisition Center, National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) Branch made a sole source, firm-fixed-price award to Data Solutions & Technology (DST), Inc. on 27 September 2014 to provide CJDB Support Services for the Combat Incident Analysis Division (CIAD) at NGIC and Joint Trauma Analysis for the Prevention of Injury in Combat (JTAPIC).  The award was made against DST, Inc. Contract GS-35F-0587S, Task Order W911W5-14-F-0034, to provide these services, pending the resolution of protests against the award of NGIC Production and Science and Technical Intelligence (S&TI) Software Programs (NPSP) Contract W911W5-14-D-0001 to Blackhawk Enterprise Incorporated on 5 September 2014.  The period of performance of W911W5-14-F-0034 was 27 September 2014 to 27 March 2015.   <br>  <br> The SBA size challenge and GAO protest were dismissed, but additional delays occurred postponing protest resolution efforts.  In light of the underlying reason for the corrective action, the contracting officer was required to re-evaluate the need, and remove a requirement for Intelligence Community Cloud integration. In addition, after GAO dismissed the protest to permit corrective action, there were internal changes to NGIC's IT infrastructure that potentially impacted requirements and needed further evaluation before soliciting final revised proposals.  After considering alternatives to the NPSP contracting vehicle, the contracting officer determined that it remained the best method of fulfilling the Agency's requirements.  After submission of final revised proposals by offerors, award has been further delayed to permit a more detailed technical analysis.  As a result, proposals remain under evaluation. <br>  <br> Pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), the agency's compelling need for CJDB Support Services was so urgent that following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays.  Further, pursuant to FAR 8.405-6 Limiting Sources, a new Limited Sources Justification was required for an extension of services on the sole source award to DST, Inc.  The Limited Sources Justification was necessitated by the fact that the option under FAR 52.217-8 was not previously evaluated as part of the contract award.  This option exercise will be at the current rate specified in the current contract, as allowed by FAR clause 52.217-8.  This option exercise will further allow for solicitation, evaluation, and award of a follow-on procurement.  The incumbent contractor, DST, Inc. is the only responsible offeror for the exercise of this option, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements if this option were not exercised before the expiration of the current task order's end date (27 March 2015).  A contract extension for continued services is essential to maintain continuity of service, prevent unacceptable delays and duplication of cost to the Government in fulfilling agency requirements for up to six (6) months until the new contract is awarded.
