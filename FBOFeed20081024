<DESC><p>A multidisciplinary research program is required to conduct research, development, and technology maturation in the area of metals behavior and life prediction. The required program will utilize numerical and experimental techniques to study metals behavior and the evolution of damage. An emphasis on physically-based, probabilistic approaches to the studied problems is highly encouraged.
<p>The proposed effort should be optimized for maximum impact in metals behavior and life prediction needs for legacy and emerging Air Force and Department of Defense systems. In addition to evolutionary research in the mechanical behavior and life prediction of conventional aerospace propulsion and airframe metals, research in emerging, high impact areas is desired. Examples of relevant, high-impact research areas are behavior and life prediction in a) graded metallic structures, b) metallic thermal protection systems, c) articles containing significant residual stresses, d) emerging hybrid materials containing combinations of metals and other materials systems (polymers, ceramics, etc.)</p>
<p>The proposed effort should also be in harmony with other, high-impact Air Force programs such as the DARPA Accelerated Insertion of Materials (AIM) and Engine System Prognosis (ESP) programs, the Engine Management Logistics Infrastructure (EMLI) program, the Engine Rotor Life Extension (ERLE) program, the Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines (VAATE) program, the Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) program, and the Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) program.</p>
<p>Specific materials systems of interest to the Air Force include, but are not limited to aluminum, titanium, and nickel-based alloys, advanced intermetallics, metal matrix composites, and fiber metal laminates.</p>

The current SATCOM terminal systems and the newly acquired systems under this requirement are and will be part of the Digital Video and Imagery Distribution System (DVIDS), a program currently under the direction of USARCENT.  These SATCOM terminal systems are and will be used to send interviews, imagery, and video footage and print stories, etc. to a centrally located hub.  Currently fielded DVIDS SATCOM terminals are in three (3) configurations DVIDS Type A (~1m antenna) - Deployable, DVIDS Type B (~2.4m antenna) - Transportable, and DVIDS Type C - Man-packable.  A potential requirement for two (2) additional configurations exists which will be called DVIDS Type D (~1.6m antenna) - Vehicle (HMVV) Mounted and a DVIDS Type E  Maritime version.  There are approximately 130 legacy terminals currently fielded in various configurations of the Norsat Newslink (DVIDS Type A/B) and Norsat Globetrekker (DVIDS Type C) systems manufactured by Norsat International (America), Inc.

<DESC>Catalogers Desktop Modernization Project
	Description, Specifications, and Statement of Work	
1. Background
The Cataloging Distribution Service (CDS) of the Library of Congress ( LC) is required to migrate its web based cataloging documentation product, Catalogers Desktop, from its current FAST NXT software to the next generation of web search delivery platform on the World Wide Web. Catalogers Desktop provides access to a large number of electronic manuals and procedural documentation that describe standards for performing cataloging and classification tasks in a library. The product is used by staff at LC as well as by many library professionals and para professionals worldwide. LC staff is located in three buildings on Capitol Hill. A very small number of LC staff are located at remote sites: Taylor St. (Washington, D.C.) and six Overseas Field Offices. Additionally, this product has subscribers in the library field nationally and internationally. 
2. Scope
The Contractor shall migrate the current FAST NXT web based delivery system for Catalogers Desktop to current web delivery search delivery technology. This systems content must be updatable on at least a quarterly basis, with web based resources updated on at least a monthly basis. The web application must use the current Catalogers Desktop product as a starting point for interface and functionality design, preserving all of the products current capabilities, but the Contractor is encouraged to use their experience to enhance Catalogers Desktops interface, search technology, and other capabilities. The application must be updatable by CDS staff, and the accompanying Subscription Management System (SMS) must be administratable by CDS staff. The product will be owned by LC, and accessible to LC staff, as well as U.S. and international subscribers of the product. The current end user product will be referred to throughout this document as Desktop 2.0. The modernized end user product will be referred to throughout this document as Desktop 3.0.
3. General Requirements
3.1 	Components of Catalogers Desktop 3.0
The Contractor shall create an information delivery system that interfaces with an already existing customer subscription management system (SMS). The SMS enables CDS staff to manage subscription  and access information for individual subscribers of Catalogers Desktop. The information delivery system that is within the scope of this project must comply with Section 508 to assure web accessibility.
3.2	Detailed information delivery system design requirements
Detailed design and functionality requirements for the information delivery system are found in section 5 below.
3.3.	Design Prototypes
The Contractor shall prepare in consultation with CDS no more than three design prototypes for the overall look and feel of Desktop 3.0. CDS will evaluate and select the preferred design. 
3.4	Target Audience
The targeted audience is library staff working in cataloging areas of their institutions. It is projected that Catalogers Desktop 3.0 will eventually be used by approximately 10,000 librarians at roughly 1,000 institutions. 400 users will be LC staff while approximately 9,600 users will be subscribers who have purchased Catalogers Desktop from CDS. The job position, educational level, and computer experience of prospective subscribers can vary tremendously. Professional library staff can have a masters degree in library science while library technicians can have high school diplomas. The language of the product shall be English, with additional interfaces in French, German, and Spanish. Interfaces in additional languages may be developed at a later date.
3.5	XML Resource Maintenance System
Resources enumerated in Appendix A Section 7 (XML/Infobase Resources) are currently being maintained as FolioViews infobase files and being converted to XML at the time they are loaded into the Desktop 2.0 product. For the Desktop 3.0 product, this resource maintenance must be migrated to the purely XML work environment. The contractor will provide a user friendly infrastructure for on going maintenance of XML resource files.
 3.6	Estimated hours
It is estimated that the Contractor shall be able to accomplish this project in approximately 400 work hours, working some of these, approximately 6 8 hours per week, at the Library of Congress in collaboration with LC staff. It is anticipated that in addition to the hours spent by the Contractor, LC staff will contribute approximately 600 hours of work to the project. Desktop 3.0 must be ready to be launched within 6 months of awarding the contract. 
4. Hardware/software Requirements
4.1	Software
The contractor must utilize software that will allow for a smooth transition from the current FAST NXT based Desktop 2.0 product with a continuation and enhancement of its functionality. Selection of the specific software to be utilized will be driven by requirements found in sections 5.4   5.6 below.
4.2	Platform
The product must work equally well while using the following web browsers:
	Firefox 2; or
	Netscape 7.0 or higher; or
	Internet Explorer 7.0 or higher (Javascript enabled), or
	Opera.
4.3	Server 
The Contractor will host both Catalogers Desktop 3.0 and its Subscription Management System. Catalogers Desktop 3.0 has a sub domain of the Library of Congress web domain (http://desktop.loc.gov). 
5. Specific Requirements
5.1	Project Plan
The project plan created by the Contractor shall lay out a well defined project schedule that describes development steps, deliverables, intermediate tasks, milestones, and resources. It shall focus on the responsibilities assigned to the Contractor, incorporating advice on content, CDSs responsibility, where necessary. It must be delivered to LC within ten (10) workdays from the date of contract award. 	
5.2 	Product Description
Appendix A: Current Catalogers Desktop 2.0 Product Description describes the existing web product. The Contractor will examine the product to see how it needs to be enhanced to capitalize on current interface and search technology. The Contractor will be provided with appropriate access to the current product and its SMS.
	Recommendations for converting the existing product to utilize search and navigation technologies configured by the contractor.
	Suggestions on methods and techniques for adding enhanced access and functionality to the product.
5.3	Design Prototypes
The design prototypes created by the Contractor shall demonstrate the overall design for Catalogers Desktop 3.0 developed from this statement of work. It shall include:
	Three (3) design prototypes will include the user interface and representative functionality. These prototypes are the property of CDS.
	CDS shall evaluate the prototypes and select one. The selected prototype will then be used as the basis for Desktop  3.0.
5.4	Catalogers Desktop 3.0   General Requirements
5.4.1	Overview
Desktop 3.0 must be developed using the current FAST NXT based Desktop 2.0 product as the starting point. It is anticipated that the contractor will employ fuller featured search and interface technologies in the Desktop 3.0 product. Additional functions and requirements are found in section 5.5 below.
5.4.2	Design
 The product must be designed with end user usability as central to its design approach. Desktop 3.0 content must be updatable by CDS staff on at least a quarterly basis. The Desktop 3.0 design must also be modular so that additional files can be added easily for new releases of Catalogers Desktop when necessary. 
5.4.3	Inputs
1.	The product must support input of resources in all of the following formats: 
	HTML
	XML
	Folio Infobases
	MS Word files
	MS PowerPoint files
	Databases
	PDF files.
a.	Current Catalogers Desktop 2.0 content is enumerated in Sections 2 8 of Appendix A. With the exception of Appendix A Section 7, all content is obtained by harvesting and re indexing resources monthly. The Desktop 3.0 product must be able to support this harvesting and re indexing activity. This crawling/indexing operation is a separate activity from the quarterly editorial updating referenced in Section 2 above.
b.	Resources enumerated in Appendix A Section 7 (XML/Infobase Resources) are currently being maintained as FolioViews infobase files and being converted to XML at the time they are loaded into the Desktop 2.0 product. For the Desktop 3.0 product, this file maintenance must be migrated to the purely XML work environment. 
c.	Resources enumerated in Appendix A Section 2 (Database Resources) are largely accessible in Desktop 2.0 as hypertext links from the products Table of Contents.  These resources must be fully searchable in the Desktop 3.0 product.
2.	Graphics will be supplied for input into the system either individually or embedded as part of a resource.
a.	The product must support input of graphics in all of the following formats: 
	BMP
	GIF
	JPG
	TIF. 
3.	Some resources and graphics will contain embedded special and foreign language characters. The contractor shall store this data as Unicode 3.0 or higher encoding. All such special and foreign language characters must be correctly displayable as text with no degradation of display quality. All special roman alphabet characters must be searchable, both in their native form as well as their non extended equivalent (i.e., "" must be searchable both as "" as well as "a").
5.5	Catalogers Desktop 3.0   Specific Requirements
5.5.1	Overview
Catalogers Desktop 3.0 must be developed using the current  Desktop 2.0 FAST NXT based 2.0 product as the starting point. All current functionality must be preserved (see Appendix B), although the methods for how the 2.0 functionality will be implemented may be adjusted. It is not essential, however, for the 3.0 release to look like the 2.0 product.
5.5.2	Enhancements
Search and interface technology has developed rapidly over the past few years. The following software capabilities are required to meet current and future subscriber needs.
1.	Search capabilities
a.	Fuzzy matches: Linguistically index and relate resources in at least the following languages: English, Spanish, French, and German
		Must be capable of bringing together alternative spellings in different national dictionaries (e.g., "color" and "colour")
		Must be capable of handling approximate spellings (e.g., "cort" and "court")
		Must be capable of phonetic spelling recognition (e.g., "skul" vs. "school")
		Must be capable of bringing together synonyms (e.g., "car" = "automobile")
b.	Must be capable of refining searches by finding or excluding similar resources related to particular search "hits." (See Appendix C.)
c.	Desktop 3.0 must incorporate searches enhanced by relevance ranking, search history, "more like this," "do you really mean this?", fuzzy matching, and query federation as well as guided discovery that replicates their search behavior.
d.	Must be capable of refining searches through the use of dynamic drill downs, based on facets of the content.
e.	Contextual analysis  Must be capable of bringing together resources based on how the search results are used in context.
f.	Search Relevancy  Must be able to measure how well search results match the intent of the users query, bringing the most relevant result first in the result set.
g.	Search history  Must be able to remember the subscribers searches and refine his/her future searches based on their past searches.
	It is desirable to be able to share searches with other subscribers.
h.	Query federation  Must be able to run searches against multiple search engines.
i.	Search through navigation  It is highly desirable to be able to search by clicking while navigating to search results, because the system knows who you are and what you are doing, thereby searching by knowing context and intention.
j.	Personal searching  It is desirable to provide a personal search experience that allows the subscriber to search across Catalogers Desktop 3.0s content as well as that of their own PC. 
k.	The search engine must mimic subscriber search behavior, bringing together related concepts that are not dependent on pre-defined hypertext links. This must be enhanceable through the use of subscriber-defined social tagging.
2.	Users work environment / interface capabilities
a.	Provide an interface in English, French, German, and Spanish.
b.	Provide an interface that is customizable by the subscriber. This must allow the subscriber to display information in a way that reflects how they conceptualize the information. Ideally this would allow them to incorporate other information into the Catalogers Desktop 3.0 environment, such as through "mash-ups."
c.	Provide an interface that allows resources to be organized in a more intuitive way, highlighting the most important resources and tying everything to the MARC 21 formats.1 
d.	Desktop 3.0 must provide visual clues and icons that will help subscribers to quickly conceptualize the nature of the resource they are consulting and how it inter relates with other resources.
e.	Desktop 3.0 must allow the subscriber to decide how much or how little s/he sees when consulting a resource.
f.	Desktop 3.0 must work well with Internet Explorer, Netscape, Firefox, and Opera web browsers.
g.	Desktop 3.0 must incorporate RSS feeds from the Library of Congress and other appropriate sources.
h.	Desktop 3.0 must facilitate linking into  Catalogers Desktop 3.0, and/or incorporation of Catalogers Desktop 3.0  into subscribers cataloging applications. Catalogers do not, however, want Desktop to become a cataloging application itself.
i.	Desktop 3.0 must enable subscribers to drag and drop shortcuts ("icons") to their computers desktops for specific, frequently consulted Catalogers Desktop 3.0 resources.
j.	Provide an interface that builds pages on the fly based on result set and characteristics of type of results.
k.	Provide an interface that alerts subscriber to changes in Cataloger s Desktop 3.0 resources based on the subscribers search history and their customizations (e.g., notes and bookmarks).


3.	Customized View
The subscriber must be able to choose his desired resources, both by selecting individual resources or sub resources, as well as by selecting one or more resource filters. (See Appendix C.) Resource filters will include any or all of the following attributes:
	Language of resource;
	Type of cataloging activity;
	Type of material being cataloged;
	Method of distribution;
	Cataloging education;
	Other related issues.
4.	URLs
		a.	The system must automatically generate a URL for each document added to Desktops content collection. 
b.	URLs assigned to each document must be persistent, short, easy to alter/control by content developers and administrators, and act as permanent Digital Object Identifiers (www.doi.org) for each piece of content they represent, even as content is edited over time. 
c.	The system must include a redirect utility to assign "vanity" URLs to sub resources. For example, there will often be a piece of content that is located, structurally, deep within the hierarchy of a document, which needs a short, easily published URL that appears to be directly off the root of the site. Catalogers Desktop must allow redirects of a top level file to flow down to all items beneath it, so that items in the hierarchy below an item that is given a directory level redirect will be automatically assigned redirects that begin with that shortened directory. 
5.5.3	Specific content requirements
1.	Federate searching  Desktop 3.0 must be able to federate searching of most database resources found in Appendix A, Section 2.This feature will enable the end user to execute a single search that will query all content resident in the product, while simultaneously executing the same search in all of the database resources utilizing their native search utilities.
2.	RDA  Desktop 3.0 must be able to fully incorporate the content and functionality of the online version of Resource Description and Access ("RDA Online")2 when it becomes available. 
3	RSS feeds  Desktop 3.0 must be able to incorporate RSS feeds for both the resources incorporated into Desktop 3.0 and resources cited in Desktop 3.0.
4.	Crawling web resources  Resources found in Appendix A, Sections 3 6 are incorporated into Catalogers Desktop 3.0 by crawling and indexing these resources on a regular basis. This crawling/indexing operation must be accomplished on at least a monthly basis and is a separate activity from the quarterly editorial updating referenced in Section 2 above.
 5.6	Catalogers Desktop 3.0   Performance, Reliability, and Stability 
1.	Catalogers Desktop 3.0  must exist in a secure environment. Provide specifics about how your organization will implement such a system. 
2.	The ability for subscribers to predict Desktop 3.0s behavior is paramount. Product performance must not degrade as traffic, number of users, or amount of content increases. Provide specifics about how your organization will ensure system performance as product content and use increase. 
3.	Catalogers Desktop 3.0 and its accompanying Subscription Management System must remain online, functional, and accessible to all subscribers (including international subscribers) 24 hours/day, 365 days per year. "Crashes," "lost connections," and unplanned downtime are unacceptable. Provide specifics about how your organization will ensure this level of availability, as well how your team will respond in the event of an outage.

11. Definitions
In this Statement of Work, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
Catalogers Desktop or Desktop 2.0: The current FAST NXT based Catalogers Desktop product. 
Customer testing. Customer testing is unit and system testing conducted by the CDS Project Team and end users both inside and outside of the Library of Congress. This testing will confirm whether critical requirements are being met, and well as providing real time evidence to support or refute underlying design assumptions.
Design prototypes: Each design prototype includes basic designs and color, font., etc. choices, a product title page, a Subscription Management System interface page, five or six resources that demonstrate a look and feel for the product that can be extended throughout the product.
Desktop 3.0: The modernized Catalogers Desktop product that incorporates the enhancements found in this Statement of Work.
MARC. MARC is an acronym for MAchine-Readable Cataloging. MARC formats are standards for the representation and communication of bibliographic and related information in machine-readable form, and related documentation. It provides the protocol by which computers exchange, use, and interpret bibliographic information. Its data elements make up the foundation of most library catalogs used today. Additional information is available online at the MARC Standards website <http://www.loc.gov/marc/>, and particularly "Understanding MARC Bibliographic" <http://www.loc.gov/marc/umb> and "Understanding MARC Authority" <http://www.loc.gov/marc/uma>.
Pilot test: A portion of the product that contains the design, search, and navigation of the final product. The pilot test must include at a minimum the following completed files: Anglo American Cataloguing Rules, Library of Congress Rule Interpretations, MARC 21 Bibliographic Format, MARC 21 Language Code List, and the Subject Headings Manual. This will be tested to determine its ease of use and freedom from bugs.
Subscription Management System: The current, web based application3 that allows CDS staff to administer customer information and subscription and access rights to Catalogers Desktop. The Subscription Management System also allows Catalogers Desktop subscribers to manage specific subsets of their institutional information within the system.
Training of CDS Project Team: Contractor provided on site training for LC staff in the following areas: XML resource maintenance (including infobase conversion if necessary and XML resource management system functionality) and upload into the  Catalogers Desktop 3.0 system, interface management, overall system management, and technical support. 
XML Resource Maintenance System. Contractor provided software system that will enable the authors of Catalogers Desktop resources (see Appendix A, Section 7) to create camera ready print masters, as well as enabling the CDS Project Team to enhance (e.g., hypertext linking, fielding) the resources for online use in Catalogers Desktop 3.0. Initial input into XML Resource Maintenance System will be Folio Infobases, XML files, and WordPerfect and Microsoft Word text files. The XML Resource Maintenance System will maintain resources as Unicode 3.0 or higher encoded XML marked up files.

Appendix A:
Current Catalogers Desktop 2.0 Product Description
1. Overview
1.1.	Catalogers Desktop is a quarterly web based cataloging documentation product produced by the Cataloging Distribution Service (CDS) of the Library of Congress (LC). Catalogers Desktop provides access to a large number of electronic manuals and procedural documentation that describe standards for performing cataloging and classification tasks in a library.
1.2.	In addition to Catalogers Desktops comprehensiveness, its chief strength lies with its extensive hypertext linking within individual files and between files, as well as the focused searching provided through the use of the advanced searching features of NXT. These features help librarians find the cataloging rules or instructions much more rapidly than would be possible if they looked for them in print.
1.3.	Catalogers Desktop is used extensively within the Library of Congress as well as via subscription throughout the United States and internationally.
1.4.	Marketing information about Catalogers Desktop is available online at <http://www.loc.gov/cds/desktop/>. The product is accessed by subscribers at <http://desktop.loc.gov>.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Part 12, utilizing FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis. This solicitation is being issued on a sole source basis under FAR Part 6.302 as sole source solicitation notification under NLM-09-007(RS). 

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Mid-Atlantic Crossroads, College Park, MD to provide advanced high-performance connectivity services to both the domestic and international research and development community.  Research and development of advanced connectivity for biomedical information distribution is one of the missions of the National Library of Medicine (NLM). To that end NLM requires high-performance connectivity at speeds up to 10 Gbps to data stores and resources available through current connectivity at the University of Maryland/Mid-Atlantic Crossroads consortium (MAX). This is required in order to enable experiments with strategies for content distribution of genomic and other research biomedical databases through exchange of data with domestic and international biomedical researchers via ultra high-performance advanced communication systems. This high-performance 10 Gbps connectivity will need to continue into the foreseeable future so that the NLM can continue to effectively and quickly communicate with research partners domestically and internationally at the highest possible speeds. Many NLM research partners domestically and internationally access its resources via high-performance connections at their respective institutions which in turn connect with their regional aggregation points which in turn connect to their national research and education networks all of which enables continued collaboration and advances in biomedical research and development supported by the NLM through its own high-performance connections.

Title: Advanced Network connectivity for content distribution experimentation

Performance Period: One year after date of award. 

NLM plans to build upon its continued use of the cost-effective Next Generation Internet/Internet2 services available through the Mid-Atlantic Crossroads (MAX) organization, part of the University of Maryland College Park, for high-performance access to local data stores located at the NIH Consolidated Collocation Site (NCCS). 

The Mid-Atlantic Crossroads (MAX) organization, part of the University of Maryland, is the only known provider of advanced high-performance connectivity services to both the domestic and international research and development community and as such is uniquely qualified for this work because of their background, expertise, and peering arrangements with regional, domestic and international research and education institutions, networks and projects.

All interested parties shall submit electronic responses to Ryan Singletary at ryan.singletary@nih.gov.  Responses must be received no later than 3:00 PM EDT on November 7, 2008.   Please reference solicitation number NLM-09-007(RS) on all correspondence to this notice.

<RESPDATE>011609
<CONTACT>Kenesha Y Hargrave, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-696-5345, Email hargrak@onr.navy.mil - Vera G Carroll, Branch Head ONR Code 253, Phone 703-696-2610, Email carrolv@onr.navy.mil
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is the lead organization for development efforts being initiated under the Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) Program. One of the technology projects headed by ONR under the INP program is Integrated Topside (InTop).  InTop is a program that will support Radio Frequency (RF) multi-functionality and resource management in order to enable greater flexibility to adapt platform capabilities to rapidly changing tactical and strategic environments. InTop systems shall also be capable of integrating additional functionality through modularity, open interfaces, and the addition/deletion of hardware and/or software without impacting the fundamental system design.

The InTop Program is to address the current condition where U.S. Navy surface combatants are increasingly employing large numbers of federated RF apertures to perform Electronic Warfare, Communication, and Radar functions; each function (and hence system) historically has its own aperture, electronics, operator, and logistics/maintenance tail. This classic stand-alone RF systems approach results in Electromagnetic Interference/Compatibility (EMI/EMC) problems that degrade system performance and increase life-cycle cost for the combatant.  Ship RF signature and radar cross section are also difficult to reduce when restricted to stand-alone RF aperture/antenna approaches. Additionally, new communications and radar requirements are increasing space, weight and power demands on the topsides and masts of new platforms, and consequently lead to larger ships requiring increased generating capacity and at significantly higher cost.  This problem of new requirements and limited space is even more critical on submarines with periscope/mast mounted systems.

The Navys purpose is to support the Technology Development (TD) and System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phases of a Navy acquisition program.  The program will develop in a spiral manner InTop TD phase System Advanced Development Models (ADMs) suitable for proof-of-concept, and subsequent SDD phase systems for full system demonstration prior to acquisition, installation and deployment on various Navy platforms.  InTop as an overarching program will adapt and develop new technologies and systems to support improved and affordable multifunction capabilities with open architectures (OA) that can be integrated with legacy and other InTop systems. InTop will provide system capabilities that can be scaled for the size and mission of the targeted platform, and incorporate a Navy developed Resource Allocation Manager (RAM) which will adapt the InTop systems in real-time to provide specific radio frequency  transmit and receive sensor and communications functions.

In order to address these issues of System size, weight, performance and RF signature and life cycle cost, ONR has sponsored research for new electronics components, RF apertures, and sensor and communications  capabilities using broadband, multifunction, RF designs and advanced technologies.  Related development and concept demonstration efforts include the Advanced Multi Function Radio Frequency Concept (AMRFC) Test Bed and the Multi-Function Electronic Warfare (MFEW) Advanced Development Model (ADM).  AMRFC and subsequently MFEW were installed and tested at the Naval Research Laboratorys (NRL) Chesapeake Bay Detachment (CBD) site in Maryland.  Future Integrated Topside concepts and systems may also be installed and demonstrated at this or other Navy test sites.

This synopsis is to announce ONRs intent to release the draft Statement of Work (SOW) (Attachment 1);and a Draft Sample Task 0001( Attachment 2)  for the development, fabrication, and testing of InTop. This effort is for the spiral development, fabrication, testing and demonstration of an InTop System of Systems. 

This blanket Statement of Work and Sample Task 0001 is being released for all offerors to provide questions or comments to ONR. However, following the draft Statement of Work and Sample Task 0001 RFP Number  N00014-09-R-0002 will be posted which shall provide for multiple awards of Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order (TO) Contracts. Multiple contract and task order awards are anticipated to investigate and adapt new technologies to support affordable multifunction capabilities, develop ADMs to test/demonstrate these new capabilities, and transition InTop capabilities for SDD and the Fleet.  The scope of the tasks that can be issued under each task order award will encompass all efforts that lead to the management, development, acquisition, appropriate integration and test of RF sensor and communications functions into legacy and future platforms, with reduced cost, manning and impact on ship design relative to an assembly of federated systems with similar capability.   Also, the scope shall capture major systems and component level procurement supporting the planned technology and systems demonstration for the study, design, fabrication, integration, and test & evaluation (T&E) tasks as required for the development of ADM, and subsequent Engineering Development Model (EDM) prototypes; and Limited Rate Initial Production (LRIP) installation of component systems of the InTop system of systems on various Naval platforms.  This may include multiple task order awards per task order solicitation.  Sample tasks is a representative of the major deliverables that are anticipated to be procured via separate task orders under the multiple award contracts that will be included in the RFP. Offerors abilities to perform under the contract will be evaluated based on the sample task proposals as well as additional criteria identified in the RFP. Offerors must show reasonable ability to work under one or more sample tasks to be eligible for basic contract award. Sample task 0001 proposals are for evaluation purposes, and may be used to issue any initial system study task order awards. Task order 0001 may be issued simultaneously with the RFP and awarded immediately after award of the basic contracts from this RFP. The anticipated basic contract award date is 
28 February 2009. The contract will have a (5) five-year ordering period.

The blanket Statement of Work under the contract intended to be awarded from this RFP will include the following types of tasks: requirements definition, trade studies, system and subsystem designs, threat analysis, development, fabrication, system integration, test, demonstration, production engineering, preparation of production documentation and qualification testing, and production and testing of limited quantities of system/subsystems for Navy platforms.  The ensuing IDIQ contracts will allow for the issuance of orders by ONR, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA),  Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) and related commands.  ONR anticipates that the basic contract will have a maximum ordering ceiling of $800M.

RFP N00014-08-R-0002 shall qualify potential suppliers for all phases of the InTop Program, award IDIQ contracts to those contractors determined to be qualified, and may award multiple initial Task Orders (TO) to a limited number of selected suppliers to: (1) conduct studies to define design approaches for Electric Attack (EA), and (2) investigate the integration of EA with a complementary Communications Transmit and/or Receive capability for surface combatants.

Subsequent Task Orders may be competitive or sole source among the qualified recipients at the Navys discretion.  

Initial Task Orders issued on this IDIQ contract for Technology Development (TD) will focus on the successful Advanced Development and subsequent demonstration of selected InTop systems for various Navy platforms. Successful demonstration will include affordable integrated multifuctionality and other function and platform specific Key Performance Factors (KPFs).  Deliverables under these TD efforts shall incorporate the technology, capacity and open architecture to support future integration of additional functions and/or enhanced performance. Proof of design scalability to support expanded RF functions and the application of multifunction RF technologies are mandates under this solicitation.  

The goals for the Technology Development (TD) phase of the InTop program are as follows: 
(1) Develop and investigate InTop and InTop system architectures as they apply to various platform design (ie. ship overall design in general, and topside design in particular) and performance parameters, and mitigate acquisition and Life Cycle Cost; (2) Establish Open Interfaces between appropriately selected system Software and Hardware Configuration items; (3) Develop, build and test ADMs of selected InTop systems including but not limited to surface ship and submarine applications; (4) Conduct InTop ADM testing that satisfies TD Phase requirements to enable a smooth transition to the SDD) Acquisition Phase with minimal changes in system architecture; 
(5) Develop, build and test critical elements and/or subassemblies which may be expected to further the objectives of the InTop Program; (6) Establish a capability (Navy/Contractor) to integrate new InTop systems with existing systems; and (7)Establish a Navy/Industry Integrated Product Team (IPT) to provide requirements and technical support to the InTop Program.  This IPT shall include representatives from both the ship requirement, design and build domain and the sensor/communications requirement, design and build domains.

The goal of the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Acquisition Phase is to develop, build and test Engineering Development Models (EDM), and subsequent Limited Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units, of selected InTop systems including but not limited to surface ship and submarine applications.

All potential offerors interested in participating in any aspects of the Integrated Topside development and LRIP acquisition are advised to respond the solicitation and demonstrate qualification for award of an InTop IDIQ contract.

Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH) in the Southwest Region (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX) The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Jan Slick, 817-886-1050; or by e-mail at errette.j.slick@usace.army.mil. FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presenc e Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to sup port ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardi zation (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has be en assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT) facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.   SCOPE OF WORK:   Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), or other similar facilities:  UEPH facilities will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to apartment type housing in the private sector.

Additional facility and functional support amenities shall be provided as outlined in the project Scope of Work.  The varying components for t his facility will be: building occupancy requirements, regional soils and climatic conditions, facility structural considerations, HVAC systems, and the exterior architectural features.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary a s required to meet project specific requirements.  It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task order s at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.

Item Purchase Descriptions


NSN:  6230-00-299-7771

LIGHT, DESK, SWINGING ARM: Adjustable, swinging-arm, mounting clamp base, fluorescent light for use on desks or drafting tables. The desk light shall be in accordance with UL 153 and the following salient characteristics:

Design.  The light shall consist of two fluorescent lamps, a reflector, lampholders, switch, ballast, capacitor, swinging arm assembly, wiring, base, electrical cord, and all other components necessary for operation. The desk light shall be designed to operate on 110 to 120 V (ac), 60 Hz. The desk light shall have a power factor of not less than 85 percent. Each light shall have a dielectric strength of 1000 volts (ac) plus twice the rated operating voltage.

Construction.  The lights shall be constructed of metal. Bases, columns, and supports shall be fabricated from one or more of the following: iron, steel, brass, bronze, aluminum, aluminum alloy, zinc alloy, or magnesium alloy. White-metal castings (lead base) shall not be used in bases, columns, or supports. Each light shall consist of a metal base with one or more metal columns or other supports, on the upper end of which shall be mounted a reflector and reflector housing. The reflector may be integral with the housing or may be separate and enclosed by a housing. All joints shall be of the die cast type. The light shall be sufficiently sturdy to withstand, without damage, the application of any force or stress to which it will be normally be subjected in service and shipment.

Exposed edges.  Exposed edges of sheet metal or other metal parts shall be finished so that personal injury due to sharp edges will not occur under normal circumstances.

Wiring.  The only external wiring shall be from the base to the plug connector and shall enter the light through or at the base. All other wiring shall be entirely concealed.

Electrical cord.  Each light shall be provided with an electrical (NEMA 1-15P) cord having an external length of not less than 5 feet with a molded-on parallel blade, 3-wire (NEMA 5-15P) grounding-type attachment plug. Straight type attachment plugs are recommended, but right-angle plugs are permitted. The cord shall be 3 conductor, including equipment grounding requirements of UL 153. The color of the cord shall be an approximate match to the color of the light finish.

Base.  The base shall consist of either two clamps, spaced approximately 3 inches apart or a clamp not less than 2.6 inches wide secured by two steel studs spaced not less than 1-1/2 nor more than 2 inches apart. The clamps shall have a minimum attachment range of 0 to 2.0 inches and shall be constructed of forged or formed steel or comparable material. Clamps shall be removable to allow the light to be attached to any surface with not less than two screws or bolts. Mounting holes shall be provided and easily accessible. A felt pad, not less than 50 percent wool, or other suitable material not less than 3/64 inch thick, of a color to harmonize with the light finish, shall be cemented to the uppermost clamping surface to prevent the light base from marring or damaging any surface on which the light is placed. Use of specialized tools shall not be required for attachment to mounting surface.

Swinging-arm assembly.  The swinging-arm assembly shall consist of 2 lightweight tubular arms, made from steel tubing not less than 0.040 inch thick, joined by a vertically adjustable elbow joint. Either or both arms may be of the single or double-rod construction. The elbow joint shall maintain any setting from fully retracted to fully extended. The extension of the swinging-arm assembly shall be 34 inches minimum. Dimensions shall be determined with the swinging-arm assembly extended such that the reflector housing is in the down position and parallel to the mounting surface. Measurement shall be taken from the point where the assembly arm containing the electrical wiring is attached to the base ballast housing assembly directly to the point where the swinging-arm assembly is attached to the reflector housing. The bottom of the reflector housing shall be 12 inches above the surface on which the light is positioned during the measurement. All connecting joints shall allow the light to retain any selected position without sagging or other distortions. A spring or other devices shall counterbalance the swinging-arm and reflector housing assembly, such that the assembly shall maintain any selected position above the base and through at least 180 degrees horizontally around the base. Any oscillation or vibration shall cease in less than 15 seconds after adjustment. The die cast joints shall retain their settings by means of balance mechanisms or compression-spring loaded friction joints; thumbscrews, wing nuts, or other methods of locking the adjustments shall not be employed.

Reflector housing assembly.  The reflector housing assembly shall contain the reflector, switch, lamp and lampholders. The lamps shall be two 15-watt, 18 inch, T-8, cool white fluorescent lamps conforming to ANSI C78.1.

Reflector.  The reflector shall be made of sheet or other rolled metal bonderized and coated with a smooth, high gloss, white enamel. The reflector shall be securely attached to the reflector housing in a manner to increase the rigidity of the assembly and prevent movement of the reflector.

Switch.  The switch shall be of the 2 button manual type and shall be securely mounted in the reflector housing by screw(s) or locknut(s).

Lampholders.  Lampholders shall permit easy insertion and removal of lamps and shall not soften or distort at or below 250 &#61616;F. Contacts shall be held securely in place and shall be insulated from one another.

Ballast.  The ballast furnished with the light shall be suitable for operation on the voltage and amperage specified. A capacitor, when used for power factor correction, shall not be connected between the electrical power wire and the neutral ground wire in any manner which causes any type of electrical discharge across the prongs of the electrical cord.

Housing.  The housing shall be attached to the upper end of the extension arm by means of a die cast universal socket. The socket shall permit the reflector housing to be rotated a minimum of 180 degrees in each of three separate perpendicular planes and shall maintain the housing in above position by means of compression-spring loaded or factory set friction joints; thumbscrews, wing nuts, or other means of locking the light in position shall not be employed. After being tested in accordance with the performance paragraph, the light shall retain any selected position without oscillating over 15 seconds and shall not exhibit any distortion, abrasion of electrical insulation, or any condition which will affect the safe use of the light. The housing shall afford free insertion and removal of both fluorescent lamps. When the lamps are in the burning position, no portion of the lamps shall project beyond the reflector rim. 

Performance.  The light shall retain any position setting without movement or distortion when tested as follows: The light shall be initially fully retracted with the reflector housing pointing down and as close to the inner arm as the design permits. The arm shall then be fully extended and the reflector housing rotated in each direction according to the housing paragraph and fully returned to the original configuration. The upper and lower joints of the arm shall be exercised for 150 cycles. Heat build-up caused by the friction of repeated movement shall be avoided by cycling the joints for 25 cycles and allowing them to cool while another lamp is tested. A resting period of 10 minutes between cycles of 25 is suggested. If the joints begin to become overly tight during the performance of 25 cycles, the test may be suspended for 10 minutes for cooling purposes. The light shall be examined after completion of 150 cycles of movement for distortion and failure to retain any position setting. The wiring shall be examined for any sign of abrasion and the dielectric strength test performed as specified in UL 153.

Finish.  All metal parts shall be cleaned, free of dirt, oil, grease and moisture, and treated and painted. All surfaces except the reflector shall be smooth baked enamel and the finish color shall be black, approximately matching color number 17038 of Federal Standard 595. All enamel surfaces shall be free from tears, star marks, crazing, blisters, hairlines, chipping, pinholes, and other irregularities or defects.

Nameplate.  An identification plate permanently and legibly providing the information required by UL 153 shall be securely attached to the light in an inconspicuous location. A decal may be used in lieu of an identification plate, provided the decal is of durable fabrication and is firmly affixed to the light fixture and legibly provides the information required by UL 153. An instruction sheet shall be furnished with each lamp instructing users to push/hold the "ON" button until the lamp is energized and the push/hold the "OFF" button until the lamp is off.

Workmanship.  The lights shall be free from defects that detract from their appearance or impair their serviceability. Electrical connections shall be secure, metal joints and seams shall be tight. The entire reflector and light assembly shall be firmly seated at all points and locked with bolts, nuts, and washers wherever necessary. Chipping, discoloration or abrasion of the surface finish shall not be permitted.

<DESC>Description

The DHS Office of Infrastructure Protection (IP) Infrastructure Information Collection Division (IICD) is seeking interested Small Business sources capable of providing technical non-personal services in support of data management.  

A solicitation is planned in the 1st quarter of the FY 09 release.

Background:

Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) establishes a national policy for Federal departments and agencies to identify and prioritize United States critical infrastructure and key resources (CIKR) and to protect them from terrorist attacks.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), Office of Infrastructure Protection (IP), Infrastructure Information Collection Division (IICD) (hereafter referred to as IICD), supports HSPD-7.  The mission of IICD is to lead the Departments efforts to acquire and provide standardized, relevant, and customer-focused infrastructure data to various public and private sector homeland security partners.

IICD provides controlled access for homeland security partners to common and consistent infrastructure information, geospatial tools, and risk and vulnerability assessment tools, technologies and methodologies customized for deployment and implementation at the local level.  IICD also establishes technical standards for integrating existing sector, state, and local tools and technologies to ensure widespread collaboration, communication, and sharing of resources and information.

To achieve its mission, IICD manages three major programs: the IP Geospatial Program, the Infrastructure Information Collection Program (IICP), and the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program.  Additionally, IICD oversees the Infrastructure Data Management activities within the Department.

IP established the IICD to provide a federated infrastructure information management, geospatial, and collection systems to security partner stakeholders who perform sector risk analysis, cross-sector risk analysis and operational response to incidents impacting the Nations infrastructure.  IICD will integrate and manage infrastructure information obtained from federal, state, local and private industry sources to provide comprehensive and accurate infrastructure information data sets.

To achieve its mission, IICD manages three major programs: the IP Geospatial Program, the Infrastructure Information Collection Program (IICP), and the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program.  Additionally, IICD oversees the Infrastructure Data Management activities within the Department.

Infrastructure Protection Geospatial Program

Infrastructure Protection Geospatial Program includes the following projects:

Integrated Common Analytical Viewer (iCAV)

The Integrated Common Analytical Viewer (iCAV) is a secure Web-based geospatial analytical and situational awareness system consisting of government-owned and licensed data, imagery and dynamic mission-specific information integrating threats, weather and situational awareness information.

iCAV unites Homeland Security (HLS) mission partners at federal, State, local, tribal and other non-government partners through a geographic Common Operating Picture (COP) for information-sharing, analysis, visualization and dissemination.
The iCAV program was initiated as mandated by Homeland Security Presidential Directive  7 (HSPD 7) to geospatially map, image, analyze and sort the nations critical infrastructure and key resources. iCAV is a critical component capability assisting NPPD along with DHS mission partners to better prepare, prevent, respond and recover from natural and man made disasters.

Geospatial information is the glue linking systems and HLS-specific mission data. iCAV provides a geospatial context for a wide variety of information systems, fusing information from suspicious activity sources and providing situational awareness by tracking disasters such as hurricanes and other real-time events.  This fusion provides federal, state and local jurisdictions; and the private sector with a rapid, common understanding of the relationships between these events to support coordinated preparedness, response, and recovery activities.

Both iCAV and the underlying Geospatial Information Infrastructure (GII) provide mechanisms for federal, state, local, and other HLS mission partners to exchange static and real-time information supporting HLS mission, situational and strategic awareness using standards-based Web services (XML/ SOAP).  While iCAV permits viewing this information in a dynamic map, the GII provides additional capabilities allowing that data to be shared, stored and archived in federally compliant standard formats.  Through iCAV, DHS connects previously stove-piped systems, providing consistent, mission-specific common operating pictures (COPs) across organizational boundaries, fostering horizontal and vertical HLS information sharing with mission partners.

Infrastructure Geospatial Production

The IICD produces geospatial displays and products to support OIP requirements and inform planning, preparedness, and protection efforts.

Infrastructure Information Collection Program (IICP)

The Infrastructure Information Collection Program (IICP) collects, catalogs, and maintains standardized Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources (CIKR) risk-related infrastructure information to enable the execution of national risk management for CIKR and for prioritizing the data for use by homeland security partners.  The IICP is an innovative initiative that addresses many of the inadequacies and limitations exposed by earlier DHS infrastructure data collection efforts.  While IICP currently incorporates independent systems, tools, and/or capabilities, the end-state will integrate these components into an interoperable capability and workflow that supports and sustains information management and exchange. IICP includes the following component projects:

Constellation/Automated Critical Asset Management System (C/ACAMS)

C/ACAMS is secure Web-based information services portal uniquely designed to help State and local first responders, emergency managers, and other homeland security officials develop and implement comprehensive CIKR protection programs in their respective jurisdictions.  C/ACAMS provides access to a comprehensive set of tools and resources for effectively collecting and using CIKR asset data, prevention and protection information, and incident response and recovery plans.

As IICDs most mature operational infrastructure information collection tool, C/ACAMS forms the cornerstone of the IICP. Developing and expanding the current C/ACAMS information technology (IT) architecture will improve access to C/ACAMS by State and local stakeholders nationwide. Expansion will continue until C/ACAMS capability and functionality is either linked to or integrated within the IICP.

Infrastructure Information Collection System (IICS)

This is a planned requirement. As such, IICS will be a robust data collection platform that includes the Infrastructure Data Warehouse (IDW), which is capable of processing infrastructure data from relevant infrastructure data sources.  The IICS will fuse data records and generate new, comprehensive composite infrastructure dataset(s) that contain accurate and complete infrastructure attributes and metadata information.  The IICS will provide a single virtual source of infrastructure data, spatially and contextually accurate, that can be fully analyzed and disseminated quickly and efficiently in any situation.  Once received, this information will provide decision-makers with key information to guide a variety of programs from disaster relief to national risk management and infrastructure protection.

IICS information will be available through user interface (UI) functionalities and capabilities that input, maintain, and query-associated information.  The UI will incorporate risk and vulnerability methodologies to help users conduct self-assessments or view the results of previously conducted analyses and evaluations.

Collected and catalogued infrastructure information has transitioned from the former National Asset Database (NADB) and now resides on a local peer-to-peer network, called the Critical Infrastructure Protection Local Area Network (CIP-LAN).  While the distributed architecture of the IICS is under development, CIP-LAN provides the interim solution for information management and storage.

Methodology Technical Implementation (MTI) Project

Methodology Technical Implementation (MTI) project works with individual Sector Specific Agencies (SSAs), Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs), infrastructure owners/operators and other appropriate parties to design, tailor and implement user-based protocols for developing or modifying infrastructure risk assessments to help individual facilities identify safety/security weaknesses and vulnerabilities.  All methodologies developed or refined will comply with the criteria outlined in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP).

Within the MTI project, sector-specific methodologies have been developed using the RAMCAP framework for nuclear power plants, nuclear spent fuel transportation and storage, petroleum refineries, chemical manufacturing plants, liquefied natural gas (LNG) off-loading terminals and, more recently, for water/wastewater treatment facilities and conventional dams and navigational locks.

The commercial facilities sector utilizes the Vulnerability Identification Self-Assessment Tool (ViSAT) to review and enhance individual site security plans using industry-generated best practices. ViSAT assessments have been developed and are available in a Web-based format for convention centers, arenas, stadiums, performing arts centers and speedways.

Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program

The PCII program encourages infrastructure owners and operators to voluntarily submit sensitive and vital information about the nations infrastructure by offering protection from public disclosure through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), state and local sunshine laws, and civil litigation.  It is a key foundation for building a trusted environment for information sharing unique to the owners and operators.  According to the Critical Infrastructure Information (CII) Act of 2002, the PCII activity is designed to help government analysts, emergency responders, and other homeland security professionals gain access to important data about the facilities and systems the country depends upon everyday.  The PCII program has increased its reach and the effectiveness of various information sharing partnerships through its accreditation program and relationships with the private sector; federal, state, and local government agencies, and other programs.  The PCII program partners with various DHS programs to integrate PCII protections into the design of information-gathering tools.  By integrating PCII protections into the design of information gathering tools, government analysts and homeland security personnel obtain critical infrastructure information while the owners and operators are reassured that their sensitive information is protected from public disclosure.  As required by the Final Rule, 6 CFR Part 29, the PCII activity facilitates access to PCII and manages PCII through the PCII Management System (PCII MS).  The PCII MS supports the PCII mission to receive process and store PCII.

Infrastructure Data Management

Infrastructure Data Management includes the following projects:

Tier 1/Tier 2 Program and Data Calls

The DHS OIP Tier 1/Tier 2 Program prioritizes the nations CIKR.  This program identifies nationally significant, high-consequence assets and systems to enhance decision-making related to CIKR protection.  Assets and systems identified through this program include those that, if destroyed or disrupted, could cause some combination of significant casualties, major economic losses, or widespread and long-term disruptions to national well-being and governance capability.

The current process of identifying these nationally significant assets and system is conducted annually, and relies on the insights and knowledge of State and territorial Homeland Security Advisors (HSAs) and Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs).  Data call submissions from these security partners provides the informational foundation for both Tier 1 and Tier 2 lists. Data call results are reviewed and vetted by DHS and SSAs, resulting in the final Tier 1 and Tier 2 lists.

The Tier 1 and Tier 2 assets and systems resulting from this program provide a common basis on which DHS and its security partners implement important CIKR protection programs and initiatives, such as grant programs, buffer zone protection efforts, facility assessments training, and related activities.

Infrastructure Taxonomy

The IP Infrastructure Taxonomy was developed to ensure that DHS is able to communicate and disseminate information among other all government agencies regarding the nations critical infrastructure.  The purpose of the Infrastructure Taxonomy is to provide a common and consistent terminology that will effectively categorize infrastructure elements that are representative of each of the 17 CIKR sectors.  The taxonomy is intended to define specific terms used by DHS to define all infrastructure types with a given sector.
	
Collection Management

The Collection Management process is a six-phased structured approach to collecting infrastructure information to respond to Requests for Information (RFIs) and to identify data requirements of customers internal and external to OIP.  These phases establish and implement a process for collecting information based on requirements, available resources, in addition to identifying sources of industry-accepted information.  The goal of the Collection Management Process is to define how to collect data and detail the actions needed to respond to RFIs.  The process consists of the following phases:

Develop Requirements: receive, validate, accept/reject, prioritize, approve
Develop Collection Plan: evaluate resources, develop draft collection, approval
Task/Request Collection: execute collection, compile data inputs, process data, quality control
Disseminate: finalize data, determine dissemination means, verify recipients, approve, disseminate, store and catalog
Customer Evaluation: customer receives, information accepted, contact customer for feedback, complete evaluation/close RFI
Evaluate Product and Process: review internal processes, update standing request list, discuss collection plan, update collection capabilities, close action item

If a contract is awarded, the contractor will be required to provide data management support services to include but not limited to project management, business process evaluation, data management solutions evaluation, testing, analysis and recommendations, data architecture services, and technical architecture evaluation.

This RFI focuses on identifying potential sources that could provide the requisite services.  This RFI is issued solely for market research, planning and information purposes and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.

Contractors, who believe they are qualified, are requested to submit a description of their capabilities, experience, and small business certification.  Responses should be limited to 20 pages and include a listing of relevant contracts including period of performance, dollar amount, and issuing organization.  Responses shall be received by close of business, November 7, 2008.  Electronic Submissions should be in a Microsoft Word or Adobe Portable Document Format. Responses should be submitted by e-mail to Iann.Washington@dhs.gov.  All questions should be submitted in writing.   Graphical content should be minimized to avoid exceeding bandwidth

<a href="mailto:gloria.bailey1@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>Brief Summary:  The US Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Acquisition Center in Orlando, FL is developing an acquisition strategy to award a multi-year Constructive Training Systems (CTS) contract.  This effort will enable the Project Manager (PM) Constructive Simulation (ConSim) to execute its mission of acquiring, fielding and sustaining the constructive simulations used to support the Army's command and staff training requirements.  The CTS contractor will provide constructive training systems as well as technical, management and professional engineering support services, for the Common Battle Command Simulation Equipment (CBCSE), Battle Command Training Capability-Equipment Support (BCTC-ES) and Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability (JLCCTC) programs, which form the base of the CTS effort.<BR><BR>Background: JLCCTC is a software modeling and simulation capability that contributes to the joint training functional concept and the Army training mission area by providing the appropriate levels of model and simulation resolution and fidelity needed to support both Army and Joint training requirements.  JLCCTC is comprised of two separate federations, Multi Resolution Federation (MRF) and Entity Resolution Federation (ERF). JLCCTC-MRF is a federated set of constructive simulation software supported by commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware (HW) and software (SW) products.  JLCCTC-MRF supports the training of commanders and their staffs in maneuver, logistics, intelligence, air defense and artillery. The federate models are connected by a combination of the standard High-Level Architecture (HLA), Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI), Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), custom interfaces, the corps battle staff Master Interface (MI) and Point-to- Point (PTP). The JLCCTC-MRF is a Command Post Exercise (CPX) driver designed to train Army commanders and their staffs at division through echelons above corps. JLCCTC-MRF provides the simulated operational environment in which computer generated forces stimulate and respond to the command and control processes of the commanders and staffs. The JLCCTC-MRF models will provide full training functionality for leader and battle staff for the Army and the Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental and Multinational (JIIM) spectrum. JLCCTC-MRF provides an interface to Battle Command (BC) equipment allowing commanders and their staffs to train with their go to war systems. JLCCTC-ERF is a federation of constructive simulations, BC interfaces, data collection and After Action Review (AAR) tools. It stimulates the BC systems to facilitate battle staff collective training by requiring staff reaction to incoming digital information while executing the commanders tactical plan. The targeted training audience is comprised of brigade and battalion battle staffs, functional Command Post (CP) training, and full CP training.  The JLCCTC new equipment training (NET) and fielding will be conducted utilizing a Hub and Spoke concept.  There are 13 Hubs and the number of spokes varies from 0-4 for each Hub.

<DESC>The Mobile District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to execute an out-of-scope modification to Contract No. W91278-08-D-0018, Indefinite Delivery Contract for AE Services for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, South Atlantic Division to Support the Mobile District Military Construction Design Program held by Mason and Hanger, Inc.  Pursuant to one IDIQ solicitation, competed among 13 firms, two contracts were awarded.  The Mason and Hanger contract was awarded on 7 April 2008 with a 5-year performance period.  Pursuant to this IDIQ, a Task Order was awarded to Mason and Hanger to provide a 100% design for the industrial processes and equipment associated with the Powertrain Transmission Facility (PTF) as well a design-build level of design for the facilities.  Due to the current bid climate, to attract sufficient interest within the construction industry, it is necessary to provide a full 100% design for the facilities.  The PTF will be supported by HVAC, fire protection and suppression systems, and electrical systems, as well as civil, structural, architectural and other mechanical design efforts.  The remaining contract capacity is insufficient for procuring the additional full facilities design and for the anticipated follow-on Title II efforts.  This is due to the extensive studies and criteria development required prior to design commencement, and to the extensive integration between the process and equipment design and the building and facilities design that must be accomplished. This advertisement serves as notice that the Government intends to modify the Mason and Hanger IDIQ contract.  It is in the best interest of the government to modify Mason and Hanger's IDIQ contract so that the Government can avail itself of the services of the original PTF designer for the aforementioned additional design efforts.  This would reduce the risk of design flaws, safety issues, contractor liability and warranty issues and construction performance issues associated with attempting to coordinate the products of multiple designers.<BR><BR>This announcement is made in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, Other Than Full & Open Competition.  It is not a request for offers.  A determination not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Written comments and supporting documentation regarding objections to modifying the Mason and Hanger, Inc. contract may be submitted to: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile, ATTN: CESAM-CT-C (Mrs. Mary Ann Sawyer), P.O.

<SUBJECT>FFP POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT FOR THREE (3)MEGAWATTS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATED FROM A PHOTOVOLIC POWER SOURCE AT NAS FALLON, NEVADA
<SOLNBR>N6247307R5214
<ARCHDATE>12012008
<CONTACT>
<DESC>SYNPOSIS: NV Energy, a utility company regulated by the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada, is currently soliciting for Renewable Energy and Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)/ Portfolio Energy Credits (PCs).  Offerors submitting proposals to acquire RECs or PCs in response to the NV Energy solicitation are required to provide information regarding a specific energy project for which the RECs/PCs will be used.  The Government is interested in acquiring renewable energy generated from a photovoltaic (PV) system located adjacent to Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada (NAS Fallon).  Based on the Government's analysis, the acquisition of RECs /PCs from NV Energy for such an acquisition of renewable power from a photovoltaic (PV) system located adjacent to NAS Fallon is required in order to ensure the economic viability of such a project.  Therefore, the Government is contemplating awarding a contract for the acquisition of renewable power without full and open competition to the successful o! fferor of the NV Energy REC or PC solicitation.  The Government will not award a contract for the purchase of PV power unless the purchase price, on a net present value basis, is less than or equal to the cost of power procured through the Government's current source(s).   
Project Description:It is the Government's intention to award an electric utility power purchase agreement (PPA) that will result in the overall lower unit cost for electric power at NAS Fallon.  The Government seeks to acquire electric power generated from a PV system with a capacity of three (3) megawatts that is constructed, owned and operated by the successful offeror on real property adjacent to NAS Fallon.  The Government is only interested in the acquisition of electric power from a photovoltaic (PV) system and is not seeking to purchase or retain any REC or PC. The Government is seeking a 20 year contract term pursuant to the statutory authority of 10 United States Code (USC)  2922a, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and its supplements.   
The Government will provide approximately thirty (30) acres of real property for the construction, ownership and operation of the PV system. The land is owned by the United States Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and is currently withdrawn from the public domain for the use of NAS Fallon.  The Navy currently has a Right of Way (ROW) application submitted to BLM and anticipates full acceptance of the application pending conceptual design documents from the successful offeror.  BLM is amenable to issuing a 30 year ROW for this purpose.  Since this ROW transaction is considered to be a federal interagency agreement, and all of the power generated by the PV system would be consumed by the Navy with no commercial sale of power to parties other than the Navy, BLM proposes to issue the ROW without charging a land use fee. Hence, no appraisal cost or associated schedule for processing is required.  The Navy will provide a right of access to the successful off! eror to develop the PV system on the land for the benefit of the Navy pursuant to FAR 52.241-5, Contractor's Facilities.   
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation associated with the described ROW has been drafted and will be finalized pending a conceptual design document from the successful offeror.  This draft Environmental Assessment (EA), ROW, Environmental Condition of Property report and other associated documents will be made available upon request.  
The Government seeks information from parties interested in entering into a contract for renewable power generated by a PV system located adjacent to NAS Fallon.  Specifically, the Government seeks information from interested parties to identify concerns regarding the Government's acquisition strategy and determination that the acquisition of REC's or PC's from NV Energy is necessary in order to ensure the economic viability of the proposed acquisition of electric power from a PV system located adjacent to NAS Fallon.  Interested parties are advised that any offeror interested in entering into a contract with the Government for the acquisition of renewable power must comply with applicable federal laws and regulations, including but not limited to financial capability, responsibility, and standard FAR contract terms and conditions. 
Responses to this notice are not considered offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
Please contact either Ms. Rea Estrella at rea.estrella@navy.mil or Mr. Marino Crozat at marino.crozat @navy.mil for your interest in this proposed project and for further project information relating to your submission of your proposal to NV Energy's Renewable Energy and Portfolio Energy Credits solicitation RFP.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking innovative solutions that will design, build, and test a legged vehicle capable of maneuvering robustly and nimbly among dismounted troops through complex terrain; carrying 400lb of equipment as well as sufficient fuel for 24 hours operation; sensing and negotiating terrain by autonomously selecting appropriate gaits, planning footfalls, and following a soldier through dynamic, cluttered environments; and operating quietly when required.  It is envisioned that this program will, at a minimum, deliver two prototype systems which will be able to follow a soldier 5-100m ahead among other troops and clutter, with zero burden on the operator to provide command or control signals.

Refer to the attachment for a complete copy of the DARPA-BAA-08-71.  The initial proposal due date is January 6, 2009.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>TITLE:  LITENING Support Sources Sought Synopsis (THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL)DESCRIPTION:*******UPDATE:  24 OCT 2008--The primary point of contact should be Mr. Daniel Demaree.  The alternate POC is Mr. Jay Thomas; see below for contact details. Additionally, the response date has been entered below as 21 Nov 2008.******The The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding a requirement to provide logistics sustainment activities and follow-on product support operations for LITENING Advanced Targeting Pods (ATPs) currently integrated on the following platforms: F-15E, F-16, B-52, A-10, F/A-18, AV-8, EA-6B.  Support for the LITENING ATPs shall include AT, AT Block 1 and Gen 4 pod versions with three (3) datalink configurations.  The purpose of the LITENING Targeting Pod System (LTPS) Support Program is to accommodate USAF, Air National Guard (ANG), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), United States Navy (USN), and United Stated Marine Corp (USMC) requirements for fielded LTPS.  The USAF proposes to establish a LITENING Support Contract (LSC) effective 1 January 2010, to provide LTPS users with support in the areas of LITENING ATP maintenance and upgrades (to include applicable Advanced Targeting Pod-Sensor Enhancement (ATP-SE) upgrades), Operational Flight Program (OFP) maintenance and upgrades, aircrew and maintenance training, site activation, over and above support, source documentation, technical manual maintenance, flight test support, studies, demonstrations, and pod integration support across aircraft platforms via Interim Contractor Support (ICS) or Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).  The ATP-SE Program is a follow-on to the current USAF ATP programs and it is anticipated that upgrade of legacy ATPs, such as the LTPS, will not be within the scope of that program.  If the Government does require future upgrades of legacy ATP systems it is anticipated that work will be done by the contractors selected for continuing support and sustainment of individual legacy ATP systems, such as that being synopsized in this announcement.  The LTPS Support Program key acquisition objectives are to maintain or improve the current level of support to the LTPS users, accommodate DoD policy requirements such as Unique Item Identification (UID) and Operational, Safety, Suitability, & Effectiveness (OSS&E) tracking, and manage obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) issues.  Factors that will be used to implement and administer the program: 1. Ship replacement Line Replacement Units (LRUs) within seven (7) calendar days after a faulty LRU reaches the contractors facility.  For items deployed outside of continental United States (CONUS) the user will be responsible for shipment between CONUS and the deployed location. Interested sources shall have the potential capability to ship serviceable assets outside CONUS.   2. The selected source shall ensure 92% availability of LITENING ATPs in each fleet. 3.  The source shall monitor and report performance on a weekly and monthly basis via a secured website.  4.  The source shall be able to meet Depot Turn Around Time (TAT).  Depot TAT shall be measured using the median of the monthly LRU repair time. The Government expects the establishment of a flexible contract structure that will allow for the continuation of supplies and services necessary to fulfill the mission, maintain peacetime and training operations, ensure combat capabilities, and pod fleet disposition alternatives as pods transition into the final stages of their service life.  The Government contemplates the LSC will be a five-year Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) contract as a follow-on to current LITENING ID/IQ contracts with Northrop Grumman System Corporation (NGC), the Original Equipment Manufacturer and prime contractor.  It should be noted that NGC and Rafael own proprietary data which may be required in order to provide the support necessary in this LSC.  In the statement of qualifications, interested sources shall include their approach to obtaining the necessary data, as the Government will not provide the data.  The sponsoring activity is 647th Aeronautical Systems Squadron, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION.  This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources.  Sources responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business, or a minority institution.  This effort is open to US bidders only.  The North American Industry Classification (NAIC) code is 336413.  Interested sources shall register as a source on the PIXS website (https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil). Also, interested sources must respond with a complete capability/qualification package describing their technical expertise and experience, personnel and facilities.  The response should also identify technical risks, issues and any partnering arrangements that may be considered.  Please provide a telephone number, an email address, and a facsimile number in the response.  Information marked as Proprietary will be protected and will not be divulged unless mandated by existing laws.  This information should be sent to 647 AESS/PK, 2145 Monahan Way, Wright-Patterson, AFB OH 45433-7017 no later than thirty (30) days from the publication of this notice.  The point of contact is Mr. Daniel Demaree, (937) 255-7979.  Any non-technical and/or contractual questions should be referred to the above individual.  Technical questions should be directed to Mr. Jay Thomas, (937) 255-5990.

What experience does your company have relating to the strategic, analytical, operational, strategic and programmatic support for the Armys Modular Force and Future Combat Systems? <BR><BR>If at least two responsible small business concerns are determined by the Government to be capable of performing this requirement based on an evaluation of the capability packages submitted by 30 Oct 08 at 2:00 p.m., the requirement will be solicited as a 100% set-aside for small business concerns.  If capability packages are not received from at least two responsible small business concerns by the response date or if the Government determines that no small businesses are capable of performing this requirement based upon an evaluation of the capability packages submitted, this requirement will be solicited under full and open procedures.  <BR><BR>To assist us in maintaining a list of interested small businesses for this potential procurement, please provide your companys name, points of contact (POC), address, phone number, and business size under the above NAICS code to Debra Parker.

TITLE:  Market Survey for Center Operations & Maintenance - Eight Major Trade Areas, for the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ
The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center (Tech Center) has a continuing requirement for services that were previously procured on a single contract, DTFACT-04-C-00014, awarded to All Star Services, Inc.  This contract expires on September 30, 2009.  One of the FAA's fundamental procurement principles is to provide attainable and reasonable opportunities for small businesses.  This announcement seeks to survey and assess the current marketplace for small businesses that are capable of performing any one of the eight major trade area services listed in Table 1, attached.  
This market survey will aid the FAA in determining whether adequate competition exists to set aside any of the requirements, listed on Table 1, for small business when the RFO follows. Responses to this announcement will be used to determine competition level and whether sufficient competition exists to set aside any of the eight major trade requirements for small business, for small, economically-disadvantaged (SEDB) firms; Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) of for very small businesses.  
Background:  Work to be done at the Tech Center covers 5000 acres, includes approximately 125 buildings, utility distribution systems, motor vehicles, and roads and grounds.  The Center contracts out nearly all its facility operations and maintenance work to private contractors, except for a small amount of work done by the Center's in-house shops.  
The current contract is a hybrid contract of fixed price work (namely operation and maintenance of the central utility plant and water treatment plant, scheduled preventive maintenance and servicing of installed equipment--approximately 15,000 items), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) time and materials and cost-plus fixed fee (such as for emergency repair of storm damage, or trash and hazardous waste removal and disposal).  Included in separate contracts and not part of this market survey are custodial/janitorial services, security guards and cafeteria operations.
The Center's COMS contract includes servicing of some of the tenant-owned facilities located on the campus.  Servicing of facilities owned and paid for by others is distinguished from Center facilities, and financed by the tenants.  Full servicing is currently provided for the FAA's Eastern Region Air Traffic Control Tower, Transportation Security laboratories and the Federal Air Marshall's training and administrative facilities; selective servicing is performed for the US Coast Guard and NJ Air National Guard.
The complete announcement is attached.Also attached are the Business Declaration Form and Table 1.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command Precision Strike Weapons Program Office (PMA-201) intends to competitively procure the Direct Attack Moving Target Capability (DAMTC). This procurement shall be conducted using full and open competition. 

NOTE:  This full and open competition will be conducted using the BEST VALUE Source Selection approach to select the most advantageous offer based on both non-price and price factors .  The Government anticipates evaluating the offers based on technical factors, price related factors and past performance.  The Government anticipates this solicitation to result in a single award of a firm fixed price contract in approximately April 2009 with a base period and three (3) option periods.   The Government shall require any potential offeror to have an approved First Article completed within twenty-four (24) months after contract award.  All potential offerors must have a Department of Defense (DOD) Secret clearance at time of award and to obtain the classified documents associated with this effort.

Proposals shall be submitted by 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 07 January 2009.      

 RELEASE OF TECHNICAL DATA PACKAGE INFORMATION:  This program includes information that has been designated a Distribution D and is only releasable to current and approved Department of Defense (DoD) contractors.  In addition, the program requires a procurement effort in certain critical technologies/data that are not releasable to foreign firms.  Some documents are under Federal export control for sensitive or controlled technologies regulated by the U.S. Department of States International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) protecting national security.  Data may not be exported without an approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act.  As such, the documents contain data whose export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law and dissemination to non-U.S. persons whether in the United States or abroad requires an export license or other authorization.  Disclosure of the control drawings requires the verification of a current license for the oral, visual or documentary disclose of technical data by U.S. persons to foreign persons as defined under the U.S. Department of State website, http://pmdtc.org/licenses.htm.

It is the contractors responsibility to provide evidence of any such agreement and/or license to this office for review and this shall be verified prior to release of any controlled documents.  

Prior to release of any control document under this solicitation, the contractor must acknowledge its responsibilities under U.S. export control laws and regulations (including the obligation, under certain circumstances, to obtain an export license prior to the release of technical data within or outside the United States) and agree that it will not disseminate any export-controlled technical data subject to this requirement in a manner that would violate applicable export control laws and regulations.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to provide this certification and/or proof of a current approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act.  Upon verification of your status and acknowledgement, the requested documents will be provided.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is the lead organization for development efforts being initiated under the Innovative Naval Prototype (INP) Program. One of the technology projects headed by ONR under the INP program is Integrated Topside (InTop).  InTop is a program that will support Radio Frequency (RF) multi-functionality and resource management in order to enable greater flexibility to adapt platform capabilities to rapidly changing tactical and strategic environments. InTop systems shall also be capable of integrating additional functionality through modularity, open interfaces, and the addition/deletion of hardware and/or software without impacting the fundamental system design.

The InTop Program is to address the current condition where U.S. Navy surface combatants are increasingly employing large numbers of federated RF apertures to perform Electronic Warfare, Communication, and Radar functions; each function (and hence system) historically has its own aperture, electronics, operator, and logistics/maintenance tail. This classic stand-alone RF systems approach results in Electromagnetic Interference/Compatibility (EMI/EMC) problems that degrade system performance and increase life-cycle cost for the combatant.  Ship RF signature and radar cross section are also difficult to reduce when restricted to stand-alone RF aperture/antenna approaches. Additionally, new communications and radar requirements are increasing space, weight and power demands on the topsides and masts of new platforms, and consequently lead to larger ships requiring increased generating capacity and at significantly higher cost.  This problem of new requirements and limited space is even more critical on submarines with periscope/mast mounted systems.

The Navys purpose is to support both the Technology Development (TD) and System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phases of a Navy acquisition program.  The program will develop in a spiral manner InTop TD phase System Advanced Development Models (ADMs) suitable for proof of concept, and subsequent SDD phase systems for full system demonstration prior to any future acquisition, installation and deployment on various Navy platforms.  InTop as an overarching program will adapt and develop new technologies and systems to support improved and affordable multifunction capabilities with open architectures (OAs) that can be integrated with legacy and other InTop systems. InTop will both provide system capabilities that can be scaled for the size and mission of the targeted platform and incorporate a Navy-developed Resource Allocation Manager (RAM) which will adapt the InTop systems in real time to provide specific radio frequency  transmit and receive sensor and communications functions.

In order to address these issues of System size, weight, performance and RF signature and life cycle cost, ONR has sponsored research for new electronics components, RF apertures, and sensor and communications  capabilities using broadband, multifunction, RF designs and advanced technologies.  Related development and concept demonstration efforts include the Advanced Multi Function Radio Frequency Concept (AMRFC) Test Bed and the Multi-Function Electronic Warfare (MFEW) Advanced Development Model (ADM).  AMRFC and subsequently MFEW were installed and tested at the Naval Research Laboratorys (NRL) Chesapeake Bay Detachment (CBD) site in Maryland.  Future Integrated Topside concepts and systems may also be installed and demonstrated at this or other Navy test sites.

This synopsis is to announce ONRs release of the draft Statement of Work (SOW) (Attachment 1)and a Draft Sample Task 0001( Attachment 2)  for the development, fabrication, and testing of InTop. This effort is for the spiral development, fabrication, testing and demonstration of an InTop System of Systems. 

This  draft Statement of Work and Sample Task 0001  are being released for all potential offerors to provide questions or comments to ONR prior to release of the solicitation. RFP Number  N00014-09-R-0002 will provide for multiple awards of Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order (TO) Contracts. Multiple contract and task order awards are anticipated to investigate and adapt new technologies to support affordable multifunction capabilities, develop ADMs to test/demonstrate these new capabilities, and transition InTop capabilities for SDD with the goal of subsequent Fleet utilization.  The scope of the tasks that can be issued under each task order award will encompass all efforts that lead to the development, appropriate integration and test of RF sensor and communications functions into legacy and future platforms, with reduced cost, manning and impact on ship design relative to an assembly of federated systems with similar capability.   Also, the scope of the tasks  shall include the study, design, fabrication, integration, and test & evaluation (T&E) tasks as required for the development of ADM, and subsequent Engineering Development Model (EDM) prototypes; and Limited Rate Initial Production (LRIP) installation of component systems of the InTop system of systems on various Naval platforms.  This may include multiple task order awards per task order solicitation.  The sample tasks are representative of the major deliverables that are anticipated to be procured via separate task orders under the multiple award contracts resulting from the RFP. Offerors abilities to perform under the proposed IDIQ contract will be evaluated based on the sample task proposals as well as on additional criteria to be identified in the RFP. Offerors must show reasonable ability to work under one or more of the sample tasks to be eligible for an initial IDIQ contract award. Sample task 0001 proposals  will be used for evaluation purposes and may also be used to issue any initial system study task order awards. Task order 0001 may be issued concurrently with the basic contracts from this RFP. The resulting contracts are expected to have a (5) five-year ordering period.  Task funding will be done though 6.1 through 6.4 program funds. The IDIQ contracts will allow for the issuance of orders by ONR, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA),  Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) and related Navy commands.  

RFP N00014-08-R-0002 shall qualify potential suppliers for all phases of the InTop Program, shall award IDIQ contracts to those contractors determined to be qualified, and may award multiple initial Task Orders (TO) to a limited number of selected suppliers to: (1) conduct studies to define design approaches for Electric Attack (EA), and (2) investigate the integration of EA with a complementary Communications Transmit and/or Receive capability for surface combatants.

Initial Task Orders issued under the resulting IDIQ contracts for Technology Development (TD) will focus on the successful Advanced Development and subsequent demonstration of selected InTop systems for various Navy platforms. Successful demonstration will include affordable integrated multifuctionality and other function and platform-specific Key Performance Factors (KPFs).  Deliverables under these TD efforts shall incorporate the technology, capacity and open architecture to support future integration of additional functions and/or enhanced performance. Proof of design scalability to support expanded RF functions and the application of multifunction RF technologies are strongly desired..  

The goals for the Technology Development (TD) phase of the InTop program are as follows: 
(1)elop and investigate InTop and InTop system architectures as they apply to various platform designs (e.g.,., ship overall design in general, and topside design in particular) and performance parameters, and mitigate acquisition and Life Cycle Cost; (2) Establish Open Interfaces between appropriately selected system Software and Hardware Configuration items; (3) Develop, build and test ADMs of selected InTop systems including but not limited to surface ship and submarine applications; (4) Conduct InTop ADM testing that satisfies TD Phase requirements to enable a smooth transition to the SDD) Acquisition Phase with minimal changes in system architecture; 
(5) Develop, build and test critical elements and/or subassemblies which may be expected to further the objectives of the InTop Program; (6) Establish a capability (Navy/Contractor) to integrate new InTop systems with existing systems; and (7)Establish a Navy/Industry Integrated Product Team (IPT) to provide requirements and technical support to the InTop Program.  This IPT shall include representatives from both the ship requirement designand-build domain and the sensor/communications requirement design and build domain.

The goal of the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase is to develop, build and test Engineering Development Models (EDMs), and subsequent Limited Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units, of selected InTop systems for testing on Navy platforms,including but not limited to surface ships and submarines.

All potential offerors interested in participating in any aspects of the Integrated Topside  TD and/or SDD phases are  encouraged to respond the forthcoming solicitation and demonstrate qualification for award of an InTop IDIQ contract.

It is anticipated that ONR will issue  the InTop  RFP on or about 1 December 2008.   Industrys comments to the draft Statement of Work and the draft Task Order 0001 description should be provided by email to Kenesha Y. Hargrave at kenesha.y.hargrave@navy.mil on or before 19 November 2008.  No hardcopies of the RFP will be mailed, faxed, or emailed.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH) in the Southwest Region (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX) The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Jan Slick, 817-886-1050; or by e-mail at errette.j.slick@usace.army.mil. FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presenc e Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to sup port ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardi zation (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has be en assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT) facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.   SCOPE OF WORK:   Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), or other similar facilities:  UEPH facilities will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to apartment type housing in the private sector.  The soldiers room s hall include, but not be limited to: private sleeping areas, walk-in closets, a shared bathroom and kitchenette.  Additional facility and functional support amenities shall be provided as outlined in the project Scope of Work.  The varying components for t his facility will be: building occupancy requirements, regional soils and climatic conditions, facility structural considerations, HVAC systems, and the exterior architectural features.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary a s required to meet project specific requirements.  It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task order s at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.   CONTRACT INFORMATION:   This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonst rating their  capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will selec t no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.   In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criter ia described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Gover nment, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Govern ment will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.   The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Appr oach   Phase II  Volume I: Building Functional and Aesthetics; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design; and Sustainability Requirements.  Volume II:  Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Past Performance on Utilization of Sm all Business Concerns.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price.   Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 10/10/2007under solicitation number W9126G-07-R-0120.  Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 11/9/2007.  (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).

<DESC><p>The New York District intends to solicit and award a dredging project of Jamaica Bay Entrance Channel, New York under Solicitation No. W912DS-09-B-0003. This project requires the dredging, possible transportation, and placement of approximately 333,000 cubic yards of material, with placement at the Historic Area Remediation Site (HARS). The contractor will be required to maintain a production rate of 4,000 cubic yards per calendar day and complete work within the required time frame of December 2008 through March 2009. In the past, this maintenance dredging operation required beach placement; therefore, it was performed with a hopper or cutterhead dredge. Based on the selection of the HARS as the disposal site, it is expected that a hopper or clamshell dredge will be used. There are no small business contractors in the New York area, or in a reasonable mobilization distance, that owns a large hydraulic or clamshell dredge. Informal market research indicates no new firms with the required equipment present in the Northeast. The apparent low bidder shall be officially notified by the contracting officer to submit the following information: a) name, location, point of contact, b) evidence of the daily production capability and the output rates of at least 4,000 cubic yards per day for their proposed integrated system of dredging and placement. In addition, a synopsis (narrative detailing the operation to move the dredged material from the dredging site to its final resting place) of the proposed operation is also to be submitted by the apparent low bidder. Bidders should consult with Section 00800 paragraph 1A.1 of the Specifications for detail submittal requirement. The Apparent low Bidder shall, within 15 calendar days from the date the Apparent low bidder is notified of being the low bidder, provide copies of all required permits and approvals for transfer, transportation, dewatering and/or other processing (if any), and final disposal of dredged material, and shall submit evidence of such permits and approval. The Contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt by him the notice to proceed, to prosecute said work diligently and to complete the basic work (216,845 CY) ready for use not later than sixty four (64) calendar days after the receipt of the notice to proceed. Optional work (5 options) totaling 115,785 cubic yards of material, if exercised, will be performed by allowing a rate of one (1) calendar day for each 4,000 cubic yards removed. The contractor is required to maintain an integrated production of at least 4,000 cubic yards per day. It is anticipated that dredging/placement would take place within the approximately time period of 15 December 2008 to 31 March 2009. The work is estimated to cost between $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about 24 October 2008 with bid opening on/about November 24, 2008. It is the intention of the Government to award and issue NTP by the first week of December 2008 with dredging to follow immediately. Liquidated Damages will be $1571.00 per calendar day of delay until all work under the contract are accepted. This is an UNRESTRICTED Procurement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, Dredging. The business size standard is $18,500,000.

Large business concerns must submit as part of their bid a subcontracting plan for this project in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-8 and FAR Clause 52-219-9.

Of that 8.8%should be placed with Small Disadvantaged Businesses, 6.2% with Women Owned Small Businesses, 7% with HUBZone Small Businesses, 9.8% with Veteran Owned Small Businesses and 3% with Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses.
