<ARCHDATE>08132004
<CONTACT>Dick Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms.gov;
<DESC>This announcement solicits White Papers, of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Operational Safety and Engineering Research (OSER).  The MMS web site has descriptions of OSER activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past projects.  The web site address is http://www.mms.gov/tarp/safety.htm.  Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented there when considering submitting White Papers. BACKGROUND: Research sponsored by MMS through the TA&R Program is used to acquire basic engineering information needed to oversee the orderly development of offshore oil and gas operations.  New challenges and informational needs arise as companies use new equipment or procedures based on technological changes or as operations expand into new or different environments such as the deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM).  The principal objective of this request for White Papers is to address innovative or technological advancements among several general topics of current interest to MMS.  As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested.  Projects selected for funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2004 funds.  The MMS anticipates a total of $800,000 to $1,000,000 may be available for the initiation of new research proposals addressing OSER topics in FY 2004 with projects being identified through this announcement and additional avenues.  Typical projects envisioned to address the topics set forth below may require one quarter to one man-year effort and prospective Offerors shall bear this in mind when responding to this request.  OBJECTIVES: The proposed objectives of the FY 2004 OSER activities include research related to the following: 1) Comparative risk analysis of subsea processing vs. surface processing, with an emphasis on a technology assessment of subsea processing equipment and its reliability, including the risks/benefits of different methods of handling produced water. 2) Technology assessment of subsea system maintenance and intervention, considering the capability to intervene/perform maintenance in the increasing depth/complexity of subsea production systems and the criteria for deciding when a subsea system needs to be shut in. 3) Risk analysis/technology assessment of deepwater subsea gas lifting, including the effects of additional induced thermal stress on risers and associated components. 4) Risk analysis /technology assessment of deep gas production equipment, including the use of current technology equipment with the extremely deep high pressure reservoirs. 5) Evaluation of the corrosive effects of unprocessed oil, gas and brine on carbon steel production piping, and the resulting high maintenance costs and loss of production. 6) Assessment of composite repair methods, their ability to control cracks, leaks and corrosion in risers, structural members and FPSOs, and the suitability of these patches/repairs being applied in a realistic offshore environment. 7) Assessment of new or improved repair techniques for aging or damaged structures, such as clamps, underwater welding, use of composite techniques, liners, member replacement, or the use of ROV's in repair operations. 8) Assessment of the reliability and integrity of large diameter Steel Compliant Risers relative to ultra-deepwater operations, including effects of fatigue, corrosion and wear associated with the terminations at the platform or at touch down at the sea floor. 9) Evaluation of dropped objects and collisions during the movement of jack up and platform drilling rigs, including the lifting of coiled tubing, snubbing and wireline units, on and off of production platforms. 10) Assessment and evaluation of industry practices for the rigging up and rigging down of well-workover equipment, including snubbing, coiled tubing and the wireline unions. 11) Assessment of the current and potential technologies and capabilities for automatic controlling and testing systems for mainline valves on subsea pipelines. 12) Technology assessment of current industry practices in drilling, completing, and producing offshore high pressure and high temperature wells, including the factors that influence the  design process. 13) Risk assessment and evaluation of the conductor pipe setting depth on shallow water wells. Examine the need for the ability to shut-in on the conductor casing along with minimum conductor casing setting criteria.  Also, determine the need for a shoe test on the conductor casing along with minimum requirements.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The MMS is interested in research initiatives relative to safety and pollution practices related to Offshore operations.  As a result of the White Papers, selected proposals will be sought and evaluated for funding.  Efforts to be considered should be to the above stated issues and/or other related issues to Offshore operations.  Multi-year funding of projects is acceptable.  HOW TO RESPOND: White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an original plus three (3) copies and one electronic copy in MS Office format on CD or diskette shall be submitted to the US Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170-4817, not later than 3:00 PM EDT September 15, 2003.  White Papers sent through email and faxes shall not be accepted.  White Papers shall define the proposed research scope and include the level of effort.  NOTE THAT COST ESTIMATES ARE NOT TO BE INCLUDED.  The White Papers will be evaluated only on technical merits.  If your white paper is selected for further evaluation, a proposal will be requested and you must also submit a cost proposal at that time.  Projects will be selected from some or all of the technical issues listed, depending on the interest and scope of White Papers received.  The MMS will evaluate the responses, and the Offerors of those deemed to have merit will be furnished information to assist in the preparation of a complete proposal.  This constitutes a Request For Proposal (RFP), but does not constitute commitment by the Government to award, nor does it restrict the solicitation to those firms meeting the screening criteria in this synopsis.

<CONTACT>BILL HOLBERT CONTRACT SPECIALIST 3034452448     bholbert@do.usbr.gov;
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD TO SOLE SOURCE DESCRIPTION:  The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Colorado State University for conducting cost-reimbursable studies in water resources management and training.  Due to TSC human resource limitations and the timeframe required from our clients to complete the work, Reclamation has contracts with universities for their faculty members and graduate students to perform specific work items under the technical supervision of TSC engineers. For example, the Sedimentation and River Hydraulics Group (D8540) has performed studies for the Albuquerque Area Office.  D8540, on behalf of our clients, also works closely with faculty members and graduate students of the Civil Engineering Department of Colorado State University (CSU) on studies related to the Middle Rio Grande Project.  To improve efficiency and reduce administrative costs, and for the benefit of TSC clients, it is highly desirable to establish a Water Resources Management and Training Center at a university with a strong program in water resources research and teaching, especially in erosion and sedimentation, river morphology, river engineering, river restoration, and erosion and sediment transport computer model development and application.  The university selected should be located within commuting distance from Denver so TSC engineers and university faculty and graduate students can remain in frequent contact and close cooperation for the benefit of TSC clients.   Under this proposed order the contractor will perform total sediment load calculations and analyses on data previously collected in the Low Flow Conveyance Channel and will provide independent peer reviews and assistance on numerical results and interpretations of sediment transport modeling studies on the Middle Rio Grande. Findings will be documented in reports that will be submitted for approval by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  The proposed action is for supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  Firms that believe they can provide the required items and services described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Firms believing they can provide similar required items and services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the supplies identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent=s ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received within 5-days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will be accepted by FAX at (303) 445-6345, or by email to Bill Holbert: bholbert@do.usbr.gov .   Responses should include the firm=s Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN.)  Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for North American Industrial Code System (NAICS) 334513, which is 500 employees. The following Federal Acquisition Regulations shall apply: 52.212-1, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, 52.212-5.   The award shall be based on a firm-fixed price for the items described above.  All shipping shall be FOB-Destination Denver Federal Center, Denver, CO.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for EASY5 software license renewals. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase two floating license renewals for EASY5 Software from MSC Software Corporation pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Competition is impractical because: EASY5 software is currently being used at NASA, Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) as a standard analytical tool and is compatible with other NASA Centers and aerospace contractors.  MSC Software is the only source for the annual license renewal of the EASY5 software. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on August 29, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC is intends to award a sole source purchase order to Coining Technology, 400 Kuller Road, Clifton, N.J. 07011-2866 for scored sheet  metal to a precise depth.  The coined or stamped sheet metal will be fabricated into ammunition containers that vent when exposed to hazardous environments.   This effort is divided into three phases.  For phase I and II, an existing die  set is required and that die set only fits on a unique coining press.  For all  phases, the contractor shall have extensive experience scoring sheet metal for  insensitive munition applications. Phases I and II:  Contractor shall utilize  existing scoring die sets (PA103E3 and PA161E3) to score the 300 sheets  required for phases I and II.  The existing die set shall be polished and  radiused.  The existing die set shall form a symmetrical score on the sheet.  That is, the score shall be centered on the sheet. The contractor shall  purchase 300 sheets required for phases I and II with specific thickness /  hardness requirements. The sheets shall be scored to the required thickness +/- 0.0005-inch tolerance. Phase IA: The contractor shall build production dies to score PA103E3 and PA161E3 sheets.  The production dies shall be capable of producing in excess of 500,000 scored sheets per year (250,000  PA103E3 and 250,000 PA161E3). The production dies shall be able to score an  entire sheet in one hit.  Contractor shall use a “two-sided” production coining or stamping process.  That is, both the top and bottom of the sheet  shall be scored.  Punch and die surfaces that contact sheet metal shall be  polished and radiused.  And, the score shall be centered on the sheet. The  maximum misalignment between the bottoms of top/bottom scores is 0.002-inch.  Phase III:  The contractor shall purchase 1000 sheets. Using the production die fabricated in phase IA, the contractor shall coin the 1000 sheets to TBD  score thickness +/- 0.0005-inch tolerance. The authority for this action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(C(1) – Only one responsible source and no other supplies or  services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) (ii).  Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in  the case of a follow-on contact.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Western Area Power Administration, Sierra-Nevada Regional Office (SNR) intends on a Sole Source basis to acquire a license for the latest version of a computer application known as VISTA.  The VISTA software is available from SynexusGlobal, Inc, (SGI) 4342 Queen Street, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada (905) 357-5997.   This software provides a decision support system for determining optimal hourly operation of the hydropower facilities of the Central Valley Project (CVP). The hydrogeneration forecasting program must possess:  1) capability of the decision support system to be integrated with existing corporate subsystems (e.g., SCADA, price or load forecasting systems) for dynamic interchange of information; 2) ability to assign and administer user access rights (read-write vs. read only) to each and every facility and/or operational constraint; 3) ability for the model to be customized to simulate the detailed reserve requirements of the CVP and for reserve constraints to be applied to either the unit, plant, plant group or system wide level; 4) ability to define complex market-based representations of the CVP transmission system using regional bus and tie line (transmission) elements and to apply transmission limits and loss constraints in real time; and 5) ability to create user-defined report templates and to generate user defined custom reports. In addition to this license, SNR will also be acquiring associated services from SGI to configure, integrate, test and train staff on the use of this software application.  Further, license provisions will include technical support, application maintenance, updates, and system upgrade services.  This sole source requirement is being processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 which allows for other than full and opens competition. SNR believes SGI is the only known source that meets the Government?s minimum functional and data requirements.  Anticipated award date is August 25, 2003. This notice is not a request for proposals or quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirements by emailing Sharon Bates at sbates@wapa.gov or by fax at (916) 985-1933 NLT 20 August 2003. Capability statements must include documentation proving ability to satisfy the Government's requirements.

<DESC>This announcement is notification of the refreshing standing Solicitation Number FCGS-X6-98-0273-N covering Federal Supply Schedule 66, Part II, Section Q – Geophysical, Environmental Analysis Equipment And Services: Class 6655 – Geophysical Instruments, Class 6675 – Surveying Equipment, Class 6655 & 6660 – Geophysical & Meteorological Instruments & Data Collection, Class 6625 – Noise Measuring Instruments, Class 6630 & 6640 – Liquid & Gas Analysis Equipment, Class 6665 – Hazard Detection Equipment.  This standing solicitation allows vendors to submit offers at anytime.  There shall be no closing date for receipt of offers under this solicitation.  This Solicitation is being refreshed to include new and updated clauses pertaining to the Multiple Schedule Program.  The Solicitation can be downloaded from the Internet at http://www.eps.gov.  The new term “Evergreen Contracting” option periods has been added to this Solicitation.  Evergreen contracts provides new policies and procedures to expand the multiyear contracts for all Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) Federal Supply Schedules to one 5 year basic contract period and three separate 5 year option periods. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option to extend the contract for an additional three five (5) years, by providing a written notice to the contractor at least 150 days in advance prior to the expiration of the contract period.  When the Government exercises its option to extend the term of this contract, option prices must be determined fair and reasonable at the time the option is exercised.  The Contracting Officer will obtain a contractor statement that the basis of award customer/Most Favored Customer (MFC) has remained the same and that pricing information provided to negotiate the contract, as updated through any modifications, has not changed unless an adjustment is made in accordance with another contract clause (e.g., Economic Price Adjustment Clause or Price Reduction Clause).  Current contractors are not required to submit an offer under this solicitation issuance.  Contracts awarded under this solicitation will have a contract period beginning on the date of award and will last for a five (5) year period, unless extended under the Evergreen option period, canceled or terminated.

All vendors and/current contractors should be aware that the Evergreen Contracting option period can not be exercised if your items offered are not on the GSA Advantage Electronic Pricelist.   This solicitation has been prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, which implement Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 (Public Law 103-355), the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-106), and the final rule, published as General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) Change 76, regarding commercial item acquisitions under the Multiple Award Schedule Program.  The contract format and data requirements in this solicitation differ from previous solicitations.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to carefully review the entire solicitation package before submission to ensure compliance with commercial item provisions. Contractors are now required to accept the Government purchase card for payments equal to or less than the micro-purchase threshold for oral and written delivery orders.  Contractors are encouraged to accept the Government purchase card for payment for orders above the micro-purchase threshold.  See GSAM Clause 552.232.77, entitled “Payment By Government Purchase Commercial Card”.   This solicitation contains the new mandatory requirements for the reporting of all sales that are made under contract, to be submitted quarterly via the Internet from a current 1% Industrial Funding Fee (IFF) to 0.75% (IFF) payment to GSA of those quarterly sales effective January 1, 2004.  The “Industrial Funding Fee”(552.238-76) is deleted entirely and replaced with “Industrial Funding Fee And Sales Reporting”  (552.238-74), which requires the submission of sales on electronic GSA Form 72A via the Internet.  Offerors must include the IFF in their prices.  The fee is included in the award price(s) and reflected in the total amount charged to ordering activities.  GSA has established a contract sales criterion for all Multiple Award Schedules.  Clause I-FSS-639, entitled “Contract Sales Criteria”, states that a contract will not be awarded if the anticipated sales are not expected to exceed $25,000.  Contracts will also be canceled unless reported sales for each 12-month period from date of award are $25,000 or above.  This Federal Supply Schedule will no longer have a prescribed beginning and ending date.  The schedule period will be continuous, and will contain contracts with contract periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years (exclusion of any options) from the DOA.  Unless otherwise noted in the solicitation, new offers may be forwarded at any time.  All requests for a diskette or hard copy of the solicitation should be faxed to (703) 305-5537, attention: Linda N. Poole.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY - The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis (based on an unsolicited proposal) with the Medical College of Ohio, School of Allied Health, 3000 Arlington Avenue, Toledo, OH 43614.   The purpose of this procurement is to design and implement preservice training and certification of organ procurement coordinators.  Because the training is based on an unsolicited proposal (which the Government has determined to be a unique and innovative approach which was independently originated and developed by the offeror, prepared without Government supervision, benefits the Agency's mission, and was not an advance proposal for a known agency requirement), The Medical College of Ohio is deemed the only responsible source capable of providing the required work and service.  The offeror has developed and owns the curriculum that, if created by any other contractor, would be a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  The Medical College of Ohio shall perform some of the services as an in-kind contribution to the Government.  This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13, Simplified Acquisition.  The period of performance for this project is one year.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) Only One Source Reasonably Available, to develop methods to perform classification on images of hyperspectral volumetric data; to apply the P-classifier algorithm on the tissue and cement powder image data sets provided by NIST; developing rules for labeling tissue and scaffold in the tissue engineering data; developing decision trees and rules for labeling  phases in cement powder that represent the characterization of cement powder in a more efficient and accurate way than is currently done.  NIST has increasingly large volumetric data sets of hyperspectral nature from diverse sources.  NIST has a need to automate the classification of this data to speed its analysis and visualization.  It is important that the methods used rely on lossless storage.  The contractor is a developer of a new lossless storage method called P-trees that enables fast access to hyperspectral data in multi-dimensions.  A fixed price Purchase Order will be issued  on or about 08/29/03 with a one year performance period.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing, no later than the response date.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  No RFQ is available.  See note 26

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>***THIS IS NOT A MODIFICATION***
*********THIS IS A SPECIAL NOTICE***********
DUE TO A TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY IN UPLOADING THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION, THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE LISTED BELOW:
1.	If the equipment is required to receive signals in “S” band  and then re-transmit the video in “S” band, will the government specify the channels to be used, insofar as minimum spacing between transmit and receive is concerned?  Spacing of channels will dictate filter design  and/or feasibility of the in-band repeat function.  There is only room for four 25 MHz wide   channels in the “S” frequency band used by D.E.A. (2210, 2235, 2260, and 2285 MHz), necessitating special filters and spacing requirements.

Answer:  Yes, as stated “the exact frequencies for the L and S band receivers and S band transmitter to be provided upon award of contract” 

2.	What standard of encryption will be required?  Will the encryptors have to be compatible with Macrovision VES-TM programmable encryptors now used by D.E.A.?
	
Answer:  “Analog encryption device capable of providing level three encryption”    
         
3.	Is the gain of the omni transmitting antenna 6 db with reference to a dipole (dbd) or referenced over isotropic (dbi)?
	
Answer:  The gain should be measured in dbi.

4.	Is the transmit antenna required to be linear or circularly polarized?  If it is to be used in an omni radiation configuration, are you aware that the transmission of video from an airborne platform in one of the major metropolitan cities (such as Los Angeles) would most likely result in interference to existing line-of-site surveillance activities now used by D.E.A. and F.B.I.?  Various other federal agencies use the “L” and “S” band frequencies for fixed microwave link activities as well.  Due to their altitude and corresponding enhanced coverage, airborne               platforms have traditionally used a GPS-driven directional antenna pod to direct the signal and minimize interference.  The ground-based video surveillance links in use in cities like Los Angeles would likely experience detrimental interference if a 10-watt omni signal was lit up from an aircraft at a 2,000-foot altitude.  The D.E.A. – Los Angeles HIDTA office has four high performance, steerable receive systems on two 5,000-foot mountain top sites that are in constant use and would experience such interference.  The F.B.I. has similar systems.

Answer:  The transmit antenna is required to be an omni-directional with minimum 6 db capability with right-hand circular polarization.
To minimize interference an additional transmit antennae with capabilities to transmit locally within a 5 mile radius of aircraft shall be included in proposal enabling transmission via either the additional antennae within 5 miles or the omni-directional antennae within 25 miles.

5.	Does the 25-mile range requirement “utilizing a directional fixed          antenna” apply to receiving a signal in the aircraft, or to receiving the signal at a remote site?  If intended for a remote site, this would conclude that the aircraft would always have to fly to a pre-determined spot to be able to have a signal “seen” by  the “fixed mounted” antenna at the receive location.  If a fixed antenna is assumed on the aircraft, then the system would not be omnidirectional.  Please clarify.
             
Answer:  The “directional fixed mounted reception antenna” is not to be provided by offeror – only used to demonstrate acceptable range capabilities of airborne equipment.

6.	For the aircraft installations, how many systems are to be bid on?  Is there to be a complete, permanent equipment installation on each aircraft, or is this only one system built to be portable between them?  If portable, will each aircraft have its own antenna installation and wiring with subsequent FAA approval         documentation, such as 337’s, etc.?  Or is the entire system meant to be completely portable?  Even in a portable configuration, some permanent wiring for power, antennas, etc. will have to be installed and FAA approved.  Placing antennas outside the aircraft via a window or open door and temporarily affixing them to the aircraft would be inappropriate according to FAA regulations, as            they might affect flight characteristics.

Answer:  At the present time the commitment is for one system.  At the present time consider this system to be a permanent installation.  

7.	Does the 90-day delivery time requested include all FAA documentation to be completed within that time frame?  Some of the aircraft manufacturers listed are slow to respond to engineering requests, and due to the installation modifications that might be required, it would be highly unlikely that FAA documentation and approvals could be obtained within the proposed time frame.  The BO-105 is made by Eurocopter, with its roots in Germany.  Experience has shown them to be resistive to approvals for their aircraft, insofar as modifications are concerned.  If the 90-day delivery time is to include FAA documentation, could the  Messerschmidt-Boelkow BO-105 be excluded pending paperwork, due to unforeseen manufacturer delays in engineering and documentation              requests?     

Answer:  The 90 day delivery timeframe includes all FAA documentation and all aircraft referenced in the solicitation.  No aircraft will be excluded from this requirement.

<DESC>UT-Battelle, LLC, (the "Company"), acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the United States Department of Energy (DOE), for management and operation of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is requesting proposals from prospective suppliers to provide support in the research and development efforts of fuel cell and advanced vehicle power electronics and machinery applications.  This Request For Proposal (RFP) is being offered on behalf of the Department of Energy's Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies.  

To achieve the goal of increasing vehicle fuel economy while maintaining cost targets, future power electronics must meet the following requirements:  reductions in size, weight, and manufacturing costs.  Additionally, reliable operation and improvements in efficiency under increased temperatures and rugged environmental conditions must be achieved.  New technological advances must be initiated to realize these objectives.  Innovative designs and manufacturing methods must be pioneered to take power electronics to the "next level" while maintaining cost goals.  

The Department of Energy's Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies is offering this RFP to foster technologies to reduce a growing dependency on oil and continually elevating pollution levels.  It is being issued in close coordination with the domestic automotive industry with the goal of developing and demonstrating significant technological advancements at low production costs.  It is broken into two subtopics for consideration.  

A.	SUBTOPIC I

The ORNL specification will outline the functional and performance requirements for a System on a Chip (SoC) motor controller for use in a broad range of applications such as hybrid and fuel cell-based vehicles.  

Today's motor controller technology revolves around commercially available digital signal processors (DSPs). These chips are able to perform the complicated high-speed mathematical functions necessary for motor control.  In some cases, DSP manufacturers have included additional circuitry within the chip, specifically for use in control applications.  However, external circuitry is still required to accomplish all the functions necessary for efficient motor control.  This specification outlines the functional and performance requirements for a traction motor controller SoC.  The proposed architecture is intended to achieve cost reduction through the integration of functions and inclusion of necessary external circuitry within a single semiconductor device.  Additionally, cost reduction will be realized by the development of a flexible modular control system suitable for use with drive systems of varying power levels.

Through the reduction in parts count and manufacturing efforts, it is hoped a cost reduction of 40 to 60% of a conventional controller board can be realized in high volume production.  

It is anticipated that this project will be separated into two phases.  Phase I will involve a detailed cost study and analysis of potential processes and packaging methods to meet the specific requirements of a Statement of Work.  Technological innovations will be highly encouraged.  A detailed development plan, power budget, and cost analysis for production quantities of 100,000, 500,000 and 1,000,000 must be presented.  A viable path to commercialization along with a schedule must be included.  A comprehensive report on all activities and accomplishments made during Phase I will be delivered to ORNL. A proposed schedule of the development effort will be established along with major milestones.  

The second phase of the project will involve the design, simulation, and synthesis of the chip.   It is anticipated that these awards may support efforts for a project period of up to two years.

B)	SUBTOPIC II

This ORNL specification will outline the functional and performance requirements for a high voltage to isolated, DC-to-DC converter for use in hybrid and fuel cell based vehicles.    It is a requirement that the converter be designed and fabricated with a baseline 14V output capable of supplying 5kW.  An additional 42V output is a highly desirable option, and its inclusion in the proposal is at the discretion of the Seller(s). For the dual output converter (42V/14V) the 14V power requirement shall be 3kW and the 42V output shall be capable of supplying 5kW.    The Statement of Work (SOW) will detail the requirements for both 14V and 42V converter outputs.  

The Seller will design and fabricate an isolated DC-to-DC converter per the specifications. A detailed cost analysis will be performed by the Seller discussing design trade offs with cost considerations.  The cost study will identify any critical or key costing issues.  The study shall include projections of costs for annual production volumes of 100,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 units.  A viable path to production must be demonstrated.  A cost objective of $75/kW has been targeted with volume and weight goals of 5 liters and 6 kg, respectively.  Technical barriers will be discussed with potential solutions.  Any issues concerning the use of the proposed technology relevant to a vehicle application will be identified.  The design will take into account an expected lifetime of 15 years or 150,000 miles.   A minimum of four (4) packaged converters will be delivered at the conclusion of the project to ORNL for evaluation.  The testing of the deliverable hardware will be undertaken to validate the design and verify readiness for use in a vehicle.    It is anticipated that this project will last up to three years. 

A detailed RFP has been issued for the scope to be subcontracted, including specific qualification requirements.  An Offeror may elect to bid on one or both subtopics as further described in the RFP.  

Please direct your requests for receipt of the RFP to 
Christine M. Sullivan by e-mail (sullivancm@ornl.gov) or 
fax (865) 241-2426.

<DESC>Reference made to Combine/Synopsis Solicitation No. BBGCON3403S5383, which was posted in the FedBizOpps on August 5, 2003.  The Combine/Synopsis is amended to provide answers to questions concerning this solicitation as Amendment No. 2.  Question No 1.  Can you please confirm that Worldnet is the only entity at BBG currently using international video feed services. If not, what other BBG entities are using international video feed services and for what purpose.  Answer: Under the contract resulting from this solicitation, the BBG will use international video feed services in news and information programs pursuant to the Rights in Data clause in the solicitation.  Under the current BBG organizational structure, television programs are produced by both WORLDNET and VOA-TV.  This solicitation seeks service sufficient to satisfy the rights statement in paragraph "Addendum 9" of the solicitation, and therefore an acceptable proposal would not be limited to particular services, programs, or audiences. Question No. 2.  Please list the specific news and information programs produced by Worldnet.  Please include length of each program, number of times aired per day and number of days aired per week.  Are all news and information programs that incorporate international video fees services Worldnet branded programs? To which region of the world, e.g. countries, does each program reach (pls. include estimated household reach)? Answer: WORLDNET currently produces fewer programs than in the past. However, WORLDNET as part of the Broadcasting Board of Governors does provide information and production support to other elements within the organization whose role may be to directly produce programs. VOA-TV is another brand that would be used on the programming.  Please note that acceptable proposals should not be based on any list of specific programs, lengths, etc. as such information is not being provided.  Question No. 3.  Does Worldnet satellite system act as a distributor?  If so, please provide specifics of programming that is distributed and to whom 
this programming is distributed.  What is the footprint of Worldnet's satellite network?  Is it analogue or digital signal? Answer: WORLDNET is not a distributor, but is a provider of news gathering information to be used by the BBG, as appropriate.  Also, WORLDNET as part of the BBG does utilize broadcast and cable systems who take the BBG programming and transmit on their systems.

<DESC>THIS IS AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION NUMBER BBGCON3603S5397-KH POSTED ON JULY 30, 2003 FOR D -- SATELLITE SERVICES.  
Question 1-Where does the content for video channel and audio channels originate? Answer 1-Miami, Florida.  Question 2-Can an offeror propose satellite-services on an alternate satellite that would meet your requirements?  Answer 2 - NO. Question 3 - Who is the SES/GS contact in your organization to present a set of capabilities for future consideration for future reference? Answer 3 - The SES/GS contact will be as specified in the FBO Notice.  Any future contact will be through the Office of Contracts. Question 4 -If the contractor (as required under this solicitation) takes the OCB signal from the New Skies 319.5 East Satellite and/or from the AOR Intelsat 332.5 Degree East Satellite, why would the contractor also need to link via fiber optic transmission, which would be duplicative?  GlobeCast could readily do a fiber optic link because its Miami teleport is within the stipulated 50 miles of OCB's Miami facility, but this would also require an additional backhaul satellite in order to rach Hispasat because Hispasat cannot be reached directly from a Miami earth station without a backhaul satellite to carry it (as the IBB New Skies and AOR Intelsat satellites do in any case).  Does the BBG solicitation stipulate this link for reasons of technical redundancy?  If this full redundancy -- including additional uplink/downlink and backhaul satellite -- is required under the solicitation, should the full expense be included in the cost proposal?  Or would another existing backhaul satellite be provided by IBB and if so, what are the technical details? Answer 4 - The fiber connection to and from the OCB facility is only mentioned to provide an option to the contractor for partial connectivity to the uplink.  No other backhaul satellite will be provided.  Question 5 - Is the OCB signal encrypted, and if so would OCB provide the contractor with smart cards and set-up box in order to decrypt? Answer 5- The OCB signal is not encrypted. Question 6 - Is 5 Mb/s bandwidth really needed for TV Marti satellite transmission into Cuba?  This size of bandwidth is normally associated with ESPN, HBO and other commercial high-resolution broadcasters, and it would seem to be more than might be required for TV Marti. Answer 6 - 5 Mb/s video is the requirement. Question 7- Provide additional information on the audio channels.  Is it correct that they are divided into two-and-two: two audio for the TV Marti program and two audio for the Radio Marti program? Answer 7- The requirement is for four (4) mono audio channels – in synch with the video. Question 8 - Please specify in as much detail as you can what is meant by "past performance" -- does this mean this performance on similar contracts in the broadcast industry? Answer 8	- Yes.  
Question 9 - Please provide whatever guidance possible as to what criteria will be used to measure the success of the 3-month Test and Demonstration (T&D) period. Answer 9 - The success of the 3-month Test and Demonstration (T&D) period will be determined at the discretion of the BBG.
Question 10 - Describe type, model, specs of the encoder to be utilized for service? Answer 10 - The OCB feed will be provided by a Scientific Atlanta PowerVu Plus system – standard MPEG2/DVB. Question 11 - Provide additional information describing the 80cm downlinks? 1) Is the 80cm antenna and downlink equipment existing and in use? 2) If 80cm antenna and downlink equipment is existing how long has it been in use? 3) Who is the manufacturer and what is the Model w/number of the downlink antenna? 4) Who is/are the manufacturer and what is/are the Model w/number of the downlink equipment? 5) How many downlinks do you anticipate a start of service and how many do you anticipate after network is completely deployed? Answer 11 - This type of information is not available from a closed society such as Cuba.  The signal is Free-to-Air and available to anyone with a large enough dish and standard MPEG2/DVB receiver. Question 12 - Are both 1 Channel of video and 4 channels of audio 24 hour, 7 days broadcast of content? Answer 12 - Yes. Question 13 - The solicitation includes item (xii) FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Satutes or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, including subparagraphs (b) (3, 6, 7, 8, and 9). Subparagraph (b) (6) incorporates 52.219-7, Notice of Partial Small Business Set-Aside.  We were unable to find in the solicitation the inclusion of the set-aside for small businesses.  What portion of this effort is set-aside for small businesses? Answer 13 - Subparagraph (b)(6) was inadvertently cited, but does not apply. This requirement is not a small business set-aside. Question 14 Contractor requested to be placed on the bidder's list for solicitation number, BBGCON3603S5397, Satellite Services. Answer 14 - There is no bidder's list for this solicitation, the FBO Notice is a combination synopsis/solicitation.
PROPOSALS ARE DUE AT THE BROADCASTING BOARD OF GOVERNORS, INTERNATIONAL BROADCASTING BUREAU, OFFICE OF CONTRACTS, ATTENTION:  KAREN S. HARPER, 330 C STREET, SW, ROOM 2529, WASHINGTON, DC 20237 ON AUGUST 15, 2003 AT 11:00 A.M., EASTERN DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME.

<DESC>17.  The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate the following changes and to announce the Coast Guard’s intent to negotiate a sole source procurement:

a.  Delete the words “develop and”, “development and” and “Request for Proposal has been issued on Federal Business Opportunities www.eps.gov” from the previously posted presolicitation dated 11 July 03.    

b.  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to negotiate a sole source procurement to Captain Franke Marine Surveyor, Inc. for Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic/Wooden Boat Inspection course.  The course was specifically developed per request of the Coast Guard Office of Navigation and Vessel Inspection (G-MVI) to train the Coast Guard marine inspectors in dealing with the vessel inspections on the fiberglass/wooden boats.  As such, all course data are proprietary to the incumbent.  Captain Franke Marine Surveyor, Inc. has developed a unique training methodology and a custom-tailored approach in fiberglass/wooden boat inspection training.  Further publication or detailed information of any notice would improperly disclose the originality of the incumbent contractor’s training methods or innovativeness of the proposed program, or would disclose proprietary information associated with the training program.  Additionally, the USCG would realize substantial duplication of costs that could not be recovered through competition.  The USCG anticipates awarding a five (5) year firm-fixed price, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The NAICS code is 611699 and the small business size standard is $6.0 million.  This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, and is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, responses received from other responsible sources prior to close of business on 29 Aug 03 will be evaluated.  Offerors responding to this notice must provide proof that they can provide the requested services.  Point of Contact for this procurement is Richard Song at 202 267 2046 or Email rsong@comdt.uscg.mil.

Contract POC: Ms. Patsy Garrison, AMSAM-AC-OS-RBB/Procurement, Building 5400, (256) 876-8762, e-mail: patsy.garrison@redstone.army.mil. The Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) is seeking sources for the development and integration of existing or emerging warhead and fuze technologies into a lethal mechanism for the APKWS guided rocket.  The contractor shall design and develop a warhe ad and fuze subsystem to meet the requirements of the draft APKWS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) in accordance with the draft APKWS Warhead and Fuze Performance Specification, MIS-PRF-xxxx, and demonstrate the Exit Criteria that will be set forth in the Statement of Work (SOW).  The warhead and fuze shall provide for life cycle safety of the rocket, prevent arming until safe separation distance is achieved, detect the target, initiate the warhead, and meet the lethality requirements set forth in dr aft APKWS Warhead and Fuze Performance Specification, MIS-PRF-xxxx, against the four classes of targets.  These four are Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV), Man Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), trucks and field fortifications/Military Operations in Ur ban Terrain (MOUT) structures.  The contractor shall select the fuzing mode or modes (e.g., point detonating, impact delay, proximity) that support(s) the lethality requirements. The three-phase program consists of a baseline task and two follow-on options .  The purpose of Phase 1, which is the baseline task, is to address any potential design shortcomings, develop a detailed refinement of the concept that was initially proposed, and extend the concept into a preliminary design. The purpose of Phase 2 is to  demonstrate a significant capability against the targets identified in the Performance Specification and establish a clear development path to meeting all of the requirements in the specification.  Testing should characterize fragment mass, fragment veloc ity, fragment distribution, pressure, temperature, and data to characterize any other kill mechanism to be considered.  Tests shall also include dynamic tests to evaluate the ability of the warhead to penetrate the MOUT and non-hardened field structures de fined in the Performance Specification.   Tests should be conducted to determine fuze performance during this phase.  Fuze testing shall include engineering, functional testing (centrifuge, drop table), subverted safety, out-of-line, and progressive arm te sting. The purpose of Phase 3 is to demonstrate the capability of the warhead and fuze subsystem to meet the performance specifications defined in the draft APKWS Warhead and Fuze Performance Specification.  Tests shall also include dynamic tests to evalua te the ability of the warhead to penetrate the MOUT /non-hardened field structures and light armored targets defined in the Performance Specification.  Warhead testing should characterize fragment mass, fragment velocity, fragment distribution, pressure, t emperature, and data to characterize any other kill mechanism to be considered in meeting the Exit Criteria.  Fuze tests shall include integrated functional tests with warhead in airgun or sled, brush sensitivity, ballistic characterization of Target Detec tion Device (TDD) function with obliquity/impact angles and velocities, limited environmental testing, and sequential life testing.  Preliminary tests shall be conducted on the warhead and fuze to obtain an indication of the IM c haracteristics and response to environmental conditioning.  These tests include bullet impact, fragment impact, slow cook-off, and fast cook-off.  Environmental tests include hot, cold, and loose cargo vibration tests.  Participation in Phase 2 and Phase 3  will be determined by Government evaluation of the contractor's performance against the Exit Criteria of the previous phase and available funding.  General Dynamics is the system integrator for the APKWS weapon system and shall be included in all program reviews to assist the Government in insuring that warhead and fuze technologies are compatible with the existing missile. The draft Statement of Work and draft Warhead and Fuze Performance Specification are available upon request.  This sources sought syno psis is for informational purposes only and is not considered to be a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to make any awards on the basis of this notification or otherwise pay for any information submitted.  However, the Governmen t does intend to issue a Request for Proposal which should lead to award of two contracts for the integrated warhead and fuze subsystem.  Each of these contracts is anticipated to be approximately $3M in total value. Interested/capable sources are requeste d to submit technical capability statements and relevant contract/assistance instrument information on or before 2 September 2003 in response to this notice.  Submissions should be limited to 25 pages or less.  Of particular interest are the internal techn ical capabilities of the interested party in the above described subsystem.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information issued by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), soliciting industry interest, input and capabilities for the development of rapid cure coatings for use by the US Navy for corrosion control and protection of shipboard ballast, fuel, Combined Holding Tanks (CHT) and potable water tanks. Significant Navy forces and resources are spent in the maintenance of the Ships within the Fleet. Current coatings technology being used by the US Navy for the preservation of tanks is limited primarily to two (2) component solvent-free epoxy coatings. These coatings have significant disadvantages, in that: a) current coatings require 8-12 hours (cure to walk-on) of controlled environmental conditions and ventilation to assure proper cure and minimal damage to freshly applied system. Such requirements place considerable time constraints on adjacent application and preservation activities do to risks associated with possible damage to freshly applied coating in neighboring tanks or spaces. b) the cumulative time requirements associated with conventional coatings results in a significant portion of current ship's availability period dedicated to the allowance of proper coating curing. c) the physical application parameters of existing coatings are not ideal when considering typical Navy shipyard locations and applications conditions. Therefore, the Navy, under the Office of Naval Research (ONR), has a desire to investigate the availability and/or development of "rapid cure" coatings for shipboard tank applications meeting these desired performance standards. Applicable coatings properties to include: application under current industrial practices, as are present in a shipbuilding and ship repair environment; application using commercially available plural component equipment, as is currently employed in industrial operations to include shipyards, general construction or infrastructure maintenance; Rapid Cure coating systems, consisting of rigid (non-elastomeric) epoxy, polyurea, polyurethane, or polyurethane hybrids, wherein, the cured system exhibits performance criteria to include the following properties: 1) performance criteria, as outlined in MIL-PRF-23236B (SH), 2) cure to walk-on times ranging from 5 seconds to 30 minutes at 75 degrees Fahrenheit, Fully cured for service optimally @ 1 day, at 75 degrees Fahrenheit, 3) solvent free (95 g/l or less), 4) free of aromatic amines (methylene dianiline), 5) minimum of 70 percent edge retention at 12 mils DFT on a 1.0 mm radius applied in one-pass, 6) simple plural component mix ratios (i.e., 1:1, or 2:1), 7) suitable for seawater ballast, fuel and potable water tank application (to include NSF approval), compensated fuel/seawater, and combined holding transfer(CHT) tanks. Additionally, systems designed for exterior applications are also being sought. Coatings of interest need to exhibit application and performance properties as generally demonstrated by the current commercial industrial coatings employed for the preservation of steel and aluminum surfaces against corrosion in a seawater environment. The coatings shall not require specialized surface preparation and or application criteria beyond those currently outlined in the U.S. Navy's, Naval Ship's Technical Manual (NSTM) chapter 631 or outlined in Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Standard 009-32 for abrasive blast cleaning and coating application. In addition the coatings shall possess the ability to provide optimum performance under the application range of 18-30 mils Dry Film Thickness (DFT). All coatings shall also have the option of a repair material for touch-up of damaged areas, as is required for areas where routine maintenance and or structural repairs have been performed. As a result, this Request for Information is being issued for the purpose of identifying those companies with appropriate expertise that might be interested in responding to a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the collaborative development of corrosion control coatings, similar to those discussed in the aforementioned text. Additional information on the Navy's corrosion control coatings requirements can be obtained from Mr. Arthur A. Webb at NRL. Should an RFP be issued for the development of corrosion control coatings for the Navy, it is anticipated that costs for development would be shared between the Navy and the contractor. This notice is being issued to help determine whether the Navy should proceed with a formal request for proposals. Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal request for proposals may be forthcoming. Offers should address as a minimum the following criteria: (1) capability and experience in the formulation, production and/or development of rapid cure corrosion control coatings, and (2) understanding of application and performance issues regarding surface preparation and coating application conditions as present in a shipbuilding/repair environment. Offers are also requested to provide rough-order-of-magnitude estimates of the cost to develop the various coatings technologies, as well as estimated development time frame. Such estimates would be non-binding on the offers. This announcement is a request for information and no contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued nor will the government pay for the information solicited. All information and data received in response to this Request for Information marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected and held in strict confidence. Responses to this notice should be provided in writing to Naval Research Laboratory, ATTN: Mr. James Martin, Code 6138, P.O.
