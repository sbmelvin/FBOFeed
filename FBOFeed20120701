<CONTACT>Deborah T Workman, Contract Specialist, Phone 770-488-2889, Fax 770-488-2868, Email atl7@cdc.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR subpart 6.302-1(c) (ii), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CDC/OID/NCHHSTP/DHAP/LAB BRANCH, intends to issue a sole purchase order for BioRad HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo kits and HIV-1/2 Plus O kits manufactured by Bio-Rad Laboratories in Hercules, CA.
<p>BioRad is the only source and we, the HIV Diagnostic and Incidence team, have developed an assay using the BioRad GS HIV-1/HIV-2 Plus-O kit with a modified protocol. The modified assay is under extensive evaluation. We have tested many specimens and are continuing to receive additional specimens to be tested using this assay. This assay is used for our ongoing HIV prevention research studies and we must use the same assay system for continuity and comparability. CDC cannot change our testing methods or research parameters in the middle of testing/studies. Any changes are unacceptable and invalid.</p>
<p>Our algorithm has been developed using the BioRad combo kit therefore screening with a 4th generation Immunoassay from BioRad will continue to provide consistency in our evaluation of the algorithm and perform HIV testing in our lab. While another HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab combo assay kit is available in the market, we cannot use that assay system as we lack a fully automated platform/equipment that is needed for that assay and that will require us to change our study measurement which is unacceptable.</p>
<p>It is the understanding of the Government that an award to any other source would cause unacceptable delays in meeting the requirements of the Government. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide the services described above should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to provide the services. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive requirement. Please send your documentation to Deborah Workman by fax (770) 488-2868, or email to atl7@cdc.gov. Documentation should be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by CDC. A determination by the CDC not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this notification, is solely within discretion of the government.</p>
