FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 

(a) The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible Offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government considering price and price related factors.
 The Government intends to award the contract to the eligible, low-priced, responsible offeror.

The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i), the non-price factor. (The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those proposals that may exceed the standards.  The technical capability to provide supplies meeting the specifications as defined in the Statement of Work (Factor i) is equal to price (Factor ii).

Offerors proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria.
 Under this factor, the Government will rate the quote as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire quote unacceptable and ineligible for award. See paragraph (b) below.

5252.204-9400 Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information 
(July 2013)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors.  The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 – “DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive – 12 (HSPD-12)” dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12.
  This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.

APPLICABILITY
This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties.  This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.
  
    
Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC).  Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below. 

ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES
Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC.  When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command’s Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual’s performance under the contract.
 

ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS
In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III.  The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI).  All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II.  IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity’s Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below.
 Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.  

Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation.  When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee’s duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command’s Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual’s performance under the contract.
  Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources.  The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental.  The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the “supervisor”. 

The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command’s Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual’s start date.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual’s start date may result in delaying the individual’s start date.
   
     
When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation.  The Contractor’s Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.  


INTERIM ACCESS
The Navy Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results.  When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.
   

DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS
The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract.  Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.

CONTRACTOR’S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE
The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor’s Security Representative.
  Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity’s Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor’s Security Representative.  The Contractor’s Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter.  The Contractor’s Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager. 

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES 
Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied.
  Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties.  This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions.  At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position.
  The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check.  Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:

•	SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)
•	Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)
•	Original Signed Release Statements

Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual’s start date shall result in delaying the individual’s start date.   Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period.
  The Contractor’s Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.

Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command’s Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual’s performance under the contract.  Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command’s Information Assurance Manager.  Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources.
  The SAAR-N shall be forwarded
to the Navy Command’s Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual’s start date.  Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual’s start date shall result in delaying the individual’s start date. 
     
The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation.  Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager.  The Navy Command’s Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
  Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment.  An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract.  The Navy Command’s Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing.  Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.  

If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor’s Security Representative.
  Although the contractor will take JPAS “Owning” role over the contractor employee, the Navy Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract.  The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR.  The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee’s performance under the contract. 

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO OR PERFORMING NON-SENSITIVE DUTIES 
Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements: 

•	Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the United States (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and 
•	Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a FBI fingerprint check prior to installation access.
  

To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor’s Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following: 

•	SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions
•	Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)
•	Original Signed Release Statements

The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or ensure successful FBI fingerprint results have been gained and investigation has been processed with OPM 

Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual’s start date may result in delaying the individual’s start date.
  

* Consult with your Command Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager for local policy when IT-III (non-sensitive) access is required for non-US citizens outside the United States.
