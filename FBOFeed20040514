<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center is soliciting proposals from interested academic health centers.  The purpose of the project is to designate multiple academic health centers as newly transformed National Centers of Excellence (CoE) in Women’s Health in the development of a national model program to advance women’s health care.  The CoE model includes a comprehensive, coordinated, and integrated gender-based program in five key areas:  leadership development and mentoring; professional education, especially incorporating allied health professionals; community outreach; clinical care; and gender-based research.  Emphasis will be directed to rural areas; prevention activities addressing cardiovascular disease, diabetes/obesity, cancer, and HIV/AIDs; and those serving diverse populations, especially American Indians.  Funds are provided by the Office on Women’s Health.  If you are an academic health center located in Region VIII which includes Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming, please see the announcement posted under Solicitation Number 04T004034.  The Government anticipates making up to four awards (although the number may change by solicitation amendment) to be effective September 30, 2004.  The period of performance shall be for a one-year base period with three one-year option periods.  The CoE program is a national program that encourages geographic diversity among its sites and for that reason states may only have two CoEs.  Currently there are two CoEs in the states of California, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.  Additionally, academic health centers that have received CoE funding in the past are excluded from consideration under this solicitation.  Solicitation Number 04T004033 will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities website approximately 15 days after publication of this notice.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center is soliciting proposals from interested academic health centers (AHCs) located in the Public Health Service Region VIII which includes Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.  (If you are an academic health center not located in Region VIII, please see the announcement posted under Solicitation Number 04T004033.)  The purpose of this project is to select one AHC in Region VIII as a demonstration project for rural women’s health programs in the development of a National Center of Excellence (CoE) in Women’s Health.  The CoE program is a national model program to advance women’s health care.  The CoE model includes a comprehensive, coordinated, and integrated gender-based program in five key areas:  leadership development and mentoring; professional education, especially incorporating allied health professionals; community outreach; clinical care; and gender-based research.  None of the current CoEs are located within the boundaries of Region VIII and no AHC meets the criteria to be designated a CoE.  Therefore, the Office of Women’s Health (OWH) shall provide technical assistance to develop a model program in any of the AHCs in Region VIII that best meets the criteria and is closest to having a model CoE program within their institution.  Emphasis will be given to those serving rural areas and diverse populations, especially American Indians. Funds are provided by the OWH.  The Government anticipates making an award to be effective September 30, 2004.  The period of performance shall be for a one-year base period with three one-year option periods.  Solicitation Number 04T004034 will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities website approximately 15 days after publication of this notice.

<DESC>Screening Information Request (SIR) DTFAAC-04-R-01128 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is announcing its plans for the single source acquisition of Tone Notching/AGC Audio Signal Processors, Digital Signal Products part number 200111-1 (170 each), applicable to FAA's Air Traffic Control's Small Tower Voice Switch (STVS), Litton Rapid Deployment Voice Switches (RDVS) 3080-C and E. A number of voice transmission problems have been reported, from various voice switching sites around the country, where the first syllable(s) or word was being cutoff at the receiving end of an air traffic control (ATC) position.  Several prototypes of each of the six proposed components have been installed and tested at various airports.  They were found to be effective in terms of solving these critical voice switching problems.  Two subsequent engineering studies confirmed the findings of the initial tests. A market survey was conducted, and between May 1 and May 8, 2001, four manufactures were interviewed, including Litton Systems, the original manufacture of the RDVS System and Digital Signal products, Inc., the manufacture of the tested prototypes.  Only Digital Signal Products, Inc., offered a satisfactory solution to the voice switching problems.  Litton Systems expressed no interest in the proposed modifications. It is critical that the voice switching problems be corrected as soon as possible.  Current conditions are unsatisfactory and unnecessarily expose the NAS to unacceptable risks that negatively impact the safety of the flying public.  We know of no company, other than Digital Signal Products that is in a position to readily respond with a proven acceptable solution. Accordingly, the FAA intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price type of order, with Digital Signal Products, for this item.

<DESC>The Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Office of Safety has a requirement to acquire contractor services to conduct a cost benefit analysis of Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) Brake systems for freight service.  Both business and safety benefits shall be analyzed.  As a result of this analysis, the most effective implementation strategy of ECP brake system freight operations in the United States must be determined.  The assessment of reliability of systems will be compared based on component failure rates determined for both existing pneumatic and ECP brake systems.  This study will differ from previous studies by more precise quantification of the business and safety benefits and determination of the most cost effective implementation strategy.  The NAICS code is 541690.  We intend to award a fixed price contract not to exceed twenty-four (24) months.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) and any other associated documents will only be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) posting system at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Administrative Support Center intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) to provide assistance in obtaining information needed to understand the impacts of coastal storms on water quality and marine resources along the southern California coast.  Specifically, the contractor will process and analyze data collected from coastal waters off of southern California to understand the impacts of post storm runoff on coastal water quality.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Procurement by less than full and open competition is necessary because the SCCWRP is the only known source to possess the scientific expertise and connection to local managers, decision makers, and scientific community necessary to provide the needed support.  This action is estimated above the simplified acquisition threshold.  Note 22 applies.

The existing Automatic Temperature Control (ATC) system will be replaced with Energy Management Control System (EMCS); a BACnet compliant Direct Digital Control (DDC) System that incorporates electronic microprocessor controls.  A new double-ended indoor unit substation will be provided with 2 - 1500KVA transformers. Consideration shall be given to require less complex construction phasing and to keep the existing cooling plant operational as long as possible during construction.  All sizes described are approximate; exact sizes will be denoted on plans and specifications to be issued with the request for proposal.  Drawings and specifications will be provided by USPS defining the Scope of Work.  Total period of the project will be 540 calendar days.  Estimated cost range is between $6,000,000 and $8,000,000. Only the most qualified contractors will be prequalified.  To be considered for Prequalification: the company must be financially capable; have five (5) years experience as a construction company with design-build experience, and the completion or ongoing of two (2) comparable projects within the past five (5) years, one of which must be a design-build construction project for USPS or a government agency.  Comparable projects are defined as "Design-build construction work of mechanical systems for USPS or other government installations, carried out in phases while keeping the existing facilities' operations least impacted during construction.  The scope includes associated electrical systems work and incidental structural and architectural work with the total construction cost ranging from $6M to $8M".  The contractors Qualification Statement will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria listed in order of importance: EXPERIENCE/PERFORMANCE and CAPABILITIES: Organization, Safety, Backlog, Financial Capability, Bonding, and Banking.

<CONTACT>POC:  Mr Roy Higgins, 781-377-5657 roy.higgins@hanscom.af.mil Contracting Officer:  Ms Priscilla Busa, 781-377-8673
<DESC>It is the intent of the Government to award a sole source contract to Sensor Technologies & Systems (STS).  It is a development effort to expand the capability of the Remote Detection and Tracking Sensor (RDTS) project to perform intrusion detection and tracking over water.  RDTS operates as a frequency modulated continuous wave radar.  It currently accomplishes wide area detection and tracking of personnel and vehicles on the ground.  It can detect and track moving personnel from 150 meters to 5,000 meters and vehicles from 150 meters to 10,000 meters.  The over the water sensor must work day or night, provide an all-weather, all terrain wide area capability to detect and track intrusions into open areas of land and water.  The system must work in atmospheres containing dense fog, smoke, haze, dust, blowing sand and clear air. The sensor must be tolerant of environmental conditions and limit alarms from small targets or environmental conditions. The goals are to effectively monitor activity of individuals and vehicles at those ranges with target range resolution within five meters.  It is desired that the sensor operate effectively with a combination of land and water in the detection area.  The capability to define areas where the sensor is insensitive is also required.  The system should complement existing military or government electro-optical systems and/or alarm display systems used for remote surveillance.  The system must also be capable of operating in frequency bands available for US Government, military and commercial use worldwide.  This will provide for delivery of one sensor system for testing. The performance specification is derived from the operational requirements of Air Force Security Forces to detect and track threats at stand-off distances.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Information received within 15 days of publication will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note 26.  See Note 26.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY!!!   The Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB, FL intends to solicit and award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Sole Source contract to Cleveland Medical Devices, Inc. (CleveMed), 11000 Cedar Avenue, Suite 130, Cleveland, OH 44106, phone (216) 791-6720.   The requirement consists of continuing the development and optimization of a state-of-the-art miniature data acquisition and telemetry system that can be non-intrusively mounted on inventory aircraft or weapons without any permanent modifications to the test item.  Equipment and services obtained under this contract will be modifications and enhancements to proprietary designs and prototype hardware and software developed by CleveMed for the Advanced Subminiature Telemetry System (ASMT) under prior Small Business Innovative Research contracts.

<DESC>Tool for Operational Planning, Force Activation and Simulation Phase-2

SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS

Objective:
The requirement is to provide NATO operational planners engaged in the analysis of force requirements for new missions with software tools to support operational planning activities.  Those tools will provide capabilities required to support the preparation and evaluation of planning products in accordance with  MC 133/3, NATO's Operational Planning System, 8 March 2000, and to conduct concurrent collaborative and distributed operational planning by multiple HQs and staffs from different functional areas.  The overall objective is to enhance information sharing, improve the availability, quality, and timeliness of information exchanges, and to achieve common situational awareness and improved operational synergy and planning synchronization.

These software tools will constitute a component of the Bi-Strategic Command’s Automated Information System Operations Functional Services (BI-SC AIS OPS FS), to be deployed on the NATO SECRET Wide Area Network (NS WAN) and installed at the various NATO Command locations.

Context: 
The development of TOPFAS has been undertaken in phases.  A prototype was first developed in order to analyze the requirements and potential solutions. This prototype was originally developed in the laboratory, and after successful field trials with users, was approved in February 2003 as an operational prototype by the NATO C3 Board (NC3B).

In parallel, a two-phase project was launched in July 2002 in order to expand the capabilities of and to industrialize the existing TOPFAS Prototype.

The Phase-1 (Specification Phase) of this project has produced the Implementation Specification Package (ISP), which will be used as a requirements baseline for the Phase-2 implementation.  The requirements specified in the ISP (Operational Concept Description, Technical Concept Description and Software Requirements Specification) are fully consistent with the TOPFAS Prototype.

The Phase-2, which consists of the Implementation of TOPFAS as an industrial product, will be performed in two increments: 

Increment-0:    The prototype software is to be enhanced to industrial standards and an underlying component-based architecture developed to serve as the basis for further development.  This will result in TOPFAS Version 3.0 which can be used both in stand-alone mode on a workstation or in client-server mode on a Headquarters LAN.
Increment-1: Additional functionality will be developed, enabling distributed collaborative operational planning process across Commands and between functional areas within the Commands. The addition of these capabilities and database replication between Headquarters will enhance TOPFAS to Version 4.0 which will be a distributed application on the NATO trusted WAN. 

Scope:  
The Phase-2 mentioned above constitutes the scope of the project.

The contractor will be required to:

Analyze, review and propose necessary changes to the requirements baselines (a task which will be performed primarily at NC3A facilities in The Hague, NL),
Create and validate a component-based software architecture,
Re-engineer the data model in line with the software architecture and in compliance with NATO data modeling standards,
Implement the software architecture through detailed design, refactoring and componentisation of the prototype code and by adding new code as required,
Integrate components,
Define, develop and conduct testing,
Deliver the software and achieve acceptance as operational baseline, 
Install the operational baseline at designated NATO sites,
Conduct Integrated Logistics Support activities, such as Training, Configuration Management, Support and Maintenance.

The product samples will be tested in accordance with paragraph 3.2.1 through 3.2.5 and paragraph 3.1.9 of the specification (see “Performance Rating Criteria”).  Offerors failing to meet any of the stated requirements of the specification, including submission of product sample documentation, may be considered unacceptable.  The offer may not be evaluated further, and may be determined ineligible for award. At the conclusion of the evaluation, the Government will award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) firm-fixed price contract to the highest rated contractor for the minimum quantities specified on CLINS 0001-0003, and 30 EA, CLIN 0004.    Factor 1 – TECHNICAL – WARNING CARTRIDGES & PROJECTILES (CLINS 0001-0004) CONFORMANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NSWC PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION  STATED IN PARAGRAPH 3 OF THE SPECIFICATION.   The Government will evaluate and assign a numerical rating for the following technical factors during  	1.  Function and casualty 	2.  Waterproofness 	3.  Physical 	4.  Range  5.  Projectile Sound Level 	6.  Cartridge Markings 	7.  Projectile Light Flash 	8.  Projectile Velocity Factor 2 – PAST PERFORMANCE.  During the source selection process, the Government will assess the offeror's past performance in the evaluation for contract award.  Accordingly, each offeror is required to submit a list of up to five of its most recent contracts within the past three years, either completed or on-going, for the same/similar products or services. It is preferred that these contracts be with U.S. Government customers, but contracts with other commercial concerns are also acceptable. Offerors are authorized to provide info rmation relative to any problems encountered on the identified contracts and any corrective actions taken by the offeror.  The Source Selection Authority (SSA)/Contracting Officer will evaluate the offeror's past performance based upon the information furnished by the offeror and/or other information obtained by the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or securing any information not furnished with the offer.  The SSA/Contracting Officer may, however, utilize all available information, including information not provided by the offeror, in the past performance evaluation.  The Government reserves the right to review less than all information submitted, and to only analyze sufficient information to make a reasonable determination of each offeror’s past performance rating. Past performance is assessed by the SSA/Contracting Officer and i s assigned a narrative rating in the evaluation.  Each offeror will be given an adjectival rating on past performance: highly favorable, favorable, neither favorable nor unfavorable, unfavorable, highly unfavorable, or no same or similar history.  Offerors who do not have same or similar past performance information reasonably available to the Contracting Officer will not be rated either favorable or unfavorable.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced offer as set forth elsewhere in the solicitation.  In addition, the Government may accept other than the lowest priced offer if doing so would result in greater value to the Government in terms of technical performance, quality, reliability, life cycle cost, or lower overall program risk.   As a part of the past performance evaluation, the Government will assess the offeror's previous complianc e with the requirements of FAR 52.219-8 and 52.219-9 as applicable. Factor 3  – PRICE EVALUATION (SEE ATTACHED UNIT PRICING TABLE) Price will not be rated but will be considered in determining the “best value” to the Government.  The best value determination may result in the Government being willing to pay a premium for higher technical capability.  The price becomes more important as the degree of equality increases between offers.   The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror or to the offeror with the highest adjectival technical score if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the greatest value to the Government. 52.212-4 TAILORING -- The following paragraphs are hereby added to the clause:    (o)  Warranty. The contractor shall extend to the Government the full coverage of any standa rd commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale, provided such warranty is available at no additional cost to the Government.

<DESC>This is a 100% 8(a) set-aside competitive procurement and is open to 8(a) firms only.  The Government intends for the 8(a) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) vehicle to be awarded as 3 to 5 contracts from a single solicitation.  Resulting 8(a) MACC contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum guarantee for each offeror awarded a contract is $15,000.  The $15,000 minimum guarantee will be deducted from the first Task Order awarded to each contractor.  The contract duration consists of a one-year base period and two one-year option periods.  The Not To Exceed (NTE) amount for the life of the overall 8(a) MACC vehicle is $100 Million.  The NTE amount for each contract will be $120 Million divided by the number of contract awardees. Task Orders will be firm fixed price with an award range between $100,000 and $1,500,000.  Note, an additional Large 8(a) MACC will be awarded by the conclusion of Fiscal Year 2004 with a Task Order award range of $1,000,000 to $6,000,000.  Offerors can submit proposals for both MACC vehicles.  
	Task Orders will consist of new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work, including any necessary design.  Task Orders may include the following types of scopes of work: design-build, 100% design, performance-based, or a combination thereof.  Projects will potentially be located at various locations serviced by Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFA NW) including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska, but primarily Washington State.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236; Construction of Buildings. The applicable size standard is $28.5M.  Representative types of projects for NAICS 236 include, but are not limited to: administrative and industrial facilities, housing renovation, childcare centers, lodges, recreation/fitness centers, retail complexes, warehouses, housing offices, community centers, commercial and institutional buildings, manufacturing and industrial buildings and other similar facilities.
     Award will be based on a tradeoff (best value) source selection, considering evaluation factors that will be identified in the solicitation.  At time of award the highest rated offeror will receive the seed project and the next most highly ranked offerors selected for contract award will receive the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate MACC proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Therefore, each initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost or price standpoint.  Offerors should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposal.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be in the best interests of the Government.         
     The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contract awardees are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Task Order evaluation factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each Task Order and may be competed on the basis of price, trade-off analysis (best value), or low price technically acceptable.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each Task Order award, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505.     
     THE SOLICITATION WILL BE OFFERED IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.  NO HARD COPIES WILL BE PROVIDED.  The solicitation package, including plans and specifications will be posted on the NAVFAC electronic solicitation website http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to check the web site for any updates to the status of the solicitation or other notices.  The only plan-holder list available is via the ESOL website under this solicitation number.  Prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.  The response time set by FAR 5.203 will begin on the date of issuance of the solicitation.  The solicitation will be posted on or about June 1, 2004.  The estimated period of proposal preparation will be 30 days.  The e-mail address for inquiries is: mark.snell@navy.mil.

A CNMP is a grouping of conservation practices and management activities for animal feeding operations (AFOs) which, when implemented as part of a conservation system, will help ensure that both production and natural resource protection goals are achieved. A CNMP incorporates practices to 1) Use animal manure, process wastewater and other organic by-products as a beneficial resource; 2) Address potential impacts of an AFO on natural resources, especially water and air quality; and 3) Assist an AFO owner/operator in meeting all applicable local, Tribal, State, and Federal water quality goals or regulations. NRCS has identified a need to develop up to
250 CNMPs for AFO facilities of EQIP and GLCI program participants over the duration of this project. See Technical Exhibit – Workload for CNMPs, attached, for a breakdown of estimated numbers of CNMPs in each county.

Solicitation No Q5023040022.  is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) and will be awarded as single award contract . SITE VISIT is highly recommended and will be conducted on May 14, 2004 @ 10:00 am at the Chickamaugn/Chattanooga  Headquarters.  Those who cannot attend may coordinate to meet with Park Reprensentative Charlie Spearman (706) 866-9241 at a later date. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 115310 the size standard is 15 million dollars. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-05. The solicitation item is as follows: Scope of Work: The contractor shall furnish all equipment, labor, materials, transportation, etc. necessary to remove approximately 3 acres of unnaturally heavy fuels accumulations at Chickamauga & Chattanooga NMP.  The work of this contract will consists of removing hazardous trees/fuels build-up which pose a significant safety /fire risk to the public and private homeowners adjacent to the park.  In designated areas all ground fuels within sixty feet of the Park boundary will be removed from the woodlands, bucked, and lopped to manageable lengths and moved from the 60-foot fuel brake.  Trees and brush 6" in diameter or smaller will be cut flush with the ground and removed from the fuel break.   Dead trees that are standing will be cut down and limbed completely.   Trees that have already fallen will be reduced, limbed and laid on the ground.  Where there are high concentrations of large dead trees that have been felled one on the other these will need to be reduced and scattered to prevent continuous large fire fuels. Pruning remaining trees in the fuel break requires branches to be cut at least ten feet from the ground this will interrupt the fire's path.  Pruning cuts should be clean and smooth, avoiding flush cuts and stubs.  All limb wood and slash may be chipped if contractor chooses this as a more cost effective method.   In the event that a chipper cannot reach the area, limb wood and slash will be dragged into the interior of the park and scattered.  Work in these areas will be sensitive as not to disturb the historical significance of any resources. No roads or access routes shall be built although a trail four feet in width may be cleared by cutting trees and removing brush along the trace of the Whiteside Turnpike where applicable for access.  No digging or removal of rocks will be permitted to allow access.  Special care should be taken when cutting and removing trees and brush in the vicinity of residences.  PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT BONDS ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS PROJECT (100% of the contract price).  Location: Chickamauga & Chattanooga National Military Park, P.O. Box 2128, Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia 30742.  Developed areas surrounding the park and in holding residential and industrial areas have developed into a Wildland Urban Interface sprawl.  This has created the need to develop defensible fuel breaks to reduce wild fire threats to the park and adjacent properties.  A fuel break 60 feet wide 1,500 feet long will be developed.  Much of the work will be conducted in sensitive areas.  In these area in particular there is a real possibility that unless the contractor is keenly aware irreversible damage could be done in completing this contract.  The contractor, along with the national park service district ranger will be responsible for marking the areas of tree work that will be done by hand because of it's in sensitive areas.  Special conditions required in these areas will be described in the contract.

<DESC>The Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), National Cancer Institute (NCI), intends to modify contract #NO2-CP-45033 with Westat, Inc., in Rockville, Maryland, to add buccal cell collection to the current statement of work.  The NEB is responsible for clarifying the nutritional etiology of cancer. Many studies have implicated diet and other nutritional exposures in carcinogenesis and it is widely believed that nutrition is causally related to malignant disease.  The main purpose of this acquisition is to incorporate the collection of buccal cell samples into the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.   The new work includes coordinating and implementing the mailing of buccal cell kits to 60,000 cohort members and 12-month storage of returned buccal cell samples.   The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study began in June 30, 1994.  From 1995 through 1996, 3.5 million questionnaires were mailed to current members of AARP, aged 50-69 years, and who resided in one of six states (California, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Louisiana) or in two metropolitan areas (Atlanta, Georgia and Detroit, Michigan).  Biospecimens have become a focus in the effort to better evaluate the relationship between nutrition and cancer. In particular, information on variation in genes encoding for metabolizing enzymes or nutrient receptors may be highly informative.  If a given exposure operates only among those with a particular allelic variant of a gene encoding a metabolizing enzyme, elucidation of the exposure-gene interaction may be critical to observing the relation between the exposure and disease.  Stratifying a study population, for example, among those with and without the pertinent metabolizing gene allelotype may reveal a relative risk that would otherwise be obscured in an analysis of the population as a whole.  Over the past nine years, Westat has directly worked with the AARP cohort as the study coordinator and maintains a confidentiality agreement with AARP.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253[c](1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Number 22 applies as follows:
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority 41 U.S.C.253 (c) (1), as set forth by FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New Jersey officials, requires a firm fixed-price, requirements contract for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Jersey City and Hoboken areas of the State of New Jersey.  This spring, APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 955 trees with an estimated total diameter at breast height (dbh) of 6,224 via soil injection and an estimated 102 trees with an estimated total potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, Rose of Sharon (dbh equal or greater than 4 inches), European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza, London Plane, and Sycamore.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  A requirements contract will be awarded in the event additional control applications are needed or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUB Zone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAIC Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average receipts.  This agency does not issue hard copies of the solicitation; you must download a copy from this website. The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about the first week in February 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer three weeks thereafter.

Note:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.

Request for Written Quotation will be issued.  The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.

A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>RESPONSE TO SOURCES SOUGHT QUESTIONS PART II 1.  Does a business have to possess all of the capabilities to perform all of the tasks listed in the SOW for every region? No, a business may demonstrate that it can preform a portion of the SOW, or that it can preform the entire SOW.  Additionally, since separate and multiple contracts are anticipated being award in each region, a business may ultimately propose in only one or a few regions. 2.  Will the potential small business vendors contract directly with EPA or will they be subcontractors under prime contract awards? The potential for both scenarios is available.

Specific knowledge of communicating scientific information in an indigenous cultural and language environment is also required in order to verify results of statistical exploration and analyses with local experts.  A proven data management plan will be needed to ensure high quality analyses and submittal to accepted data repositories.  Results of data analysis will be interpreted and evaluated in a final synthesis report.  Production of a draft manuscript of findings for publication in peer-reviewed scientific literature is also expected.

<DESC>Y -- SOURCES SOUGHT

The U. S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set-aside an acquisition for Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) concerns only.  The estimated magnitude of this construction project is between $3,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 237990 and the small business size standard is $28.5 Million.  The acquisition is for the Shoreline Repairs, U. S. Coast Guard Training Center Yorktown, Yorktown, VA.  The scope of the project follows: Phase 1: Install an anchored steel sheet pile bulkhead starting in the vicinity of the Navy Pier, extending approximately 700 feet to the southeast.  The anchoring system will consist of soil anchors installed at approximately 10 feet on center with a reinforced concrete cap serving as the wale.  The bulkhead will be approximately 19 feet high from top of concrete cap to top of riprap toe protection.  The top of the bulkhead will be at EL +28.0 NGVD with the tips of the sheet piles at EL –14.0 NGVD.  Work will also include removal of existing concrete blocks, miscellaneous debris, and removal of approximately 500 feet of chain link fence.  Install new VDOT Class III stone toe protection at the base of the bulkhead to protect the toe of the bulkhead from scour during storm events.  The top of the toe protection will be at EL +9 NGVD, with the base of the toe protection at EL +5 NGVD.  The stone will rest on a 6 inch bedding layer of No. 357 stone and geotextile fabric.  Phase 2: Install new stone shore protection along the slope starting at the end of the new anchored steel sheet pile bulkhead and continuing to the edge of Area 3 (approximately 1200 feet).  The shore protection consists of a 6 inch thick bedding layer of No. 357 stone covered with geotextile fabric.  A 4 foot thick layer of VDOT Class III armor stone will be placed on top of the geotextile fabric.  The top of the shore protection is at EL +11 NGVD and slopes down to toe at EL +1 NGVD at 2.5H:1V slope.  The existing storm drainage outfalls will be extended through the new stone shore protection using ductile iron pipe.  The existing outfalls consist of reinforced concrete pipe and corrugated metal pipe.  Work will also include removal of miscellaneous debris and removal of approximately 550 feet of chain link fence.  Phase 3: Install new stone shore protection along the slope starting at the end of Area 3 and continuing to the edge of Area 5 (approximately 950 feet) in order to preserve the existing shoreline and vegetation, and protect existing utilities ad structures.  The shoreline protection will be similar to the proposed Phase 2 revetment.  The existing storm drainage outfalls will be extended through the new stone shore protection using ductile iron pipe.  The existing outfalls consist of reinforced concrete pipe, corrugated metal pipe, cast iron pipe, and PVC pipe.  Phase 4: Provide beach nourishment within Area 5, which consists of placing and grading sand on the shoreline behind the existing breakwater mounds to build it up pre-storm conditions.  The top of the slope will be at EL +5 NGVD and sloped to EL 0 NGVD.  The sand will be trucked in and mechanically placed and graded.  Provide vegetation sprigging on the new sand slopes between the York River and Wormley Creek to provide erosion control measures for the slope and incidental related work.  Work includes a base bid item and two additive items.  At the present time, the acquisition is expected to be issued under full and open competition procedures.

Title: 	A Dielictric Slit Die for In-Line Monitoring of Liquids Processing

Description:  	The dielectric slit die is an instrument that is designed to measure electrical, rheological, ultrasonics, optical and other properties of a flowing liquid.  In one application, it is connected to the exit of an extruder, pump or mixing machine that passes liquefied material such as molten plastic, solvents, slurries, colloidal suspensions, and foodstuffs into the sensing region of the slit shaped die.  Dielectric sensing is the primary element of the slit die, but in addition to the dielectric sensor, the die contains other sensing devices such as pressure, optical fiber, and ultrasonic sensors that simultaneously yield an array of materials property data.  The slit die has a flexible design that permits interchangeability among sensors and sensor positions.  The design also allows for the placement of additional sensors and instrumentation ports that expand the potential data package obtained.

7.  Terms/Conditions/Attachments added, deleted or modified:

ADD: SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS.

(1) Vessel is required to have lashing points and provide sufficient lashing gear to secure the required cargo.  Should the selected vessel already have commercial cargo loaded aboard, or commercial cargo to be picked up, the carrier will ensure the cargo stipulated above is “last on and first off,” and that the contract carrier provides detailed stow plans with cargo stowage locations and the order of vessel ports of call within the same established time frames.

(2) Cargo Handling Equipment List.  If other than liner terms, Owner shall provide a list of cargo handling equipment on the ship no later than 72 hours prior to Vessel’s arrival at the designated loading port (or first designated loading port in the case of multiple load ports).  If award is made within 72 hours of ship’s arrival at the designated load port (or first designated loading port in the case of multiple load ports), the cargo equipment list shall be made available within 24 hours of award.  

(3) Crew List.  Offerors must provide an accurate and current crew list with proposal.
Further, at any time during the contract period a list of any reliefs scheduled to board the vessel is required 96 hours prior to the personnel change.  The crew list shall include full name (including middle name or the letters “NMN” if no middle name), date of birth, place of birth (city and country), passport number and country of issue, and nationality of all crewmembers and other personnel onboard the Vessel. The list shall be submitted in an electronic format (Microsoft Excel only).  Scanned lists are unacceptable. 

ADD:  IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY.

(1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C Terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

(2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets, said cost to be included in the offered rate.

ADD: FORCE PROTECTION.  

(1) Owner agrees that U. S. Armed Forces personnel may board the Vessel at any time at any location for U. S. national security purposes, gives consent for such boarding, and agrees to cooperate fully with such U.S. Armed Forces personnel in the boarding party.  Owner also agrees to permit U. S. Armed Forces personnel to search without limitation any and all vessel spaces for U.S. national security purposes.

(2) Owner agrees to render all necessary assistance to U. S. Armed Forces personnel with respect to the identification and screening of crew members or such others as may be aboard the Vessel.  Owner consents to the immediate removal of crewmembers or such others as may be aboard the Vessel deemed unsuitable for any reason by the Contracting Officer or U.S. Armed Forces personnel.  Owner agrees to replace any such crewmembers promptly and that such replacements will fully comply with all crew screening requirements.  Charterer agrees to bear proven and reasonable costs incurred by Owner associated with replacement, if necessary.

(3) Charterer reserves the right, at Charterer’s sole option, to embark U.S. Armed Forces personnel and their weapons at any time during the period of the Charter to protect U. S. Armed Forces personnel, cargo or equipment on board the Vessel.  These force protection personnel will provide security in accordance with rules of engagement established by competent U. S. military authorities and will operate under the command of such authorities.  Charterer agrees to reimburse Owner for cost of such personnel at the rate set forth in the Charter for Supercargo.

(4) Owner agrees to comply fully with the current ship threat condition measures required by relevant Navy and MSC Force Protection instructions and messages for the threat condition of the area.  

ADD: SECURITY THREAT.  In the event of a security threat or incident involving the ship, crew or cargo during the voyage, the ship's master should report any incident immediately to the MSC Area Command in whose area the ship is currently located.  The MSCHQ Command Center should be contacted if the Area Command cannot be reached.  Contact numbers will be provided upon award.

ADD:  SALVAGE.

(1) When engaged in the carriage of government cargo and if requested by Charterer, Owner agrees to accept Navy salvage services.  Such services may be provided using Navy personnel and resources or Navy contracted resources.

(2) In providing such services, the Navy, through Charterer, agrees to waive all claims for “pure” or “bonus” salvage.  Instead, in those cases in which the salvage services are provided by Navy personnel and resources, the salvage claim shall be limited to a schedule of current per diem rates and allowable expenses as established by the Navy’s Supervisor of Salvage.  In no event shall such amount exceed a maximum claim of $25,000 per day.

(3) In those situations in which the Navy utilizes contracted resources to deliver assistance, Owner shall be liable for the actual daily rate charged to the Navy by the contractor(s).

(4) It is understood that this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim is asserted against the vessel only, is solely for the vessel's account, and does not include any amounts for the salvage of the Government's cargo.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim IS NOT directly or by way of setoff chargeable in whole or in part to the Government by way of general average or otherwise.

ADD: DEMURRAGE/DETENTION DOCUMENTATION.  In the event of demurrage/detention, all supporting documents as identified in the invoicing clause shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for approval prior to submission of demurrage/detention invoices.  After receiving the Contracting Officer's concurrence, Owner may submit demurrage/detention invoices to the office identified in Box 18b of SF 1449.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service – Florida announces a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for Architect and Engineering firms interested in contracting for A&E Services for preparation and implementation of wetlands restoration and management plans for projects throughout Florida. 
 
Engineering services required may include but are not limited to design of earthen dikes, water control structures, and other conservation practices, surveying, hydrologic modeling, preparation of construction plans (drawings), preparation of construction specifications, preparation of cost estimates, preparation of bid schedules, preparation of design reports, related studies, and all associated engineering services for the planning, design and construction of the wetlands restoration plans.  The firm will be required to perform engineering design activities in accordance with NRCS standards and certify that designs meet NRCS standards.  A quality assurance plan will need to be prepared for construction activities.
  
The firm shall consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the appropriate Water Management District in the development of the wetlands restoration plan and obtain appropriate permits from the local, state, and Federal agencies.  The wetlands restoration plans shall comply with the consultation requirements of Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.  Appropriate cultural resource compliance studies shall be conducted by individuals meeting the Secretary of the Interior’s professional qualification standards.

The purpose of wetlands restoration is to restore the natural wetland functions on the selected property to its natural condition to the maximum extent practicable by restoring the pre-drainage hydrology which includes time, depth, and duration.  The restoration design concept involves the use of water control structures, dikes, earthen blocks, etc., to maintain the water level in the wetlands at higher elevations for longer periods of time.  The design must evaluate on-site and off-site hydrologic effects and not create adverse on-site and off-site impacts.  The ultimate goal of restoration is to enhance and maintain habitat for wetland dependant wildlife.  Services required may include (1) field investigations to perform biological and cultural resource inventories, (2) preparations of biological and cultural resource evaluations, (3) design and preparation of habitat management plans, (4) certification of completed practices in accordance with NRCS standards and specifications set forth in Section IV of the Field Office Technical Guide, National Biology Manual, National Biology Handbook, National Planning Procedures Handbook and Florida supplements to these documents.

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS prepared by the National Park Service in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation No Q5023040022.  is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) and will be awarded as single award contract . SITE VISIT is highly recommend and will be conducted on May 14, 2004 @ 10:00 am . The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 115310 the size standard is 15 million dollars. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-05. The solicitation item is as follows: Scope of Work: The contractor shall furnish all equipment, labor, materials, transportation, etc. necessary to remove approximately 3 acres of unnaturally heavy fuels accumulations at Chickamauga & Chattanooga NMP.  The work of this contract will consists of removing hazardous trees/fuels build-up which pose a significant safety /fire risk to the public and private homeowners adjacent to the park.  In designated areas all ground fuels within sixty feet of the Park boundary will be removed from the woodlands, bucked, and lopped to manageable lengths and moved from the 60-foot fuel brake.  Trees and brush 6" in diameter or smaller will be cut flush with the ground and removed from the fuel break.   Dead trees that are standing will be cut down and limbed completely.   Trees that have already fallen will be reduced, limbed and laid on the ground.  Where there are high concentrations of large dead trees that have been felled one on the other these will need to be reduced and scattered to prevent continuous large fire fuels. Pruning remaining trees in the fuel break requires branches to be cut at least ten feet from the ground this will interrupt the fire's path.  Pruning cuts should be clean and smooth, avoiding flush cuts and stubs.  All limb wood and slash may be chipped if contractor chooses this as a more cost effective method.   In the event that a chipper cannot reach the area, limb wood and slash will be dragged into the interior of the park and scattered.  Work in these areas will be sensitive as not to disturb the historical significance of any resources. No roads or access routes shall be built although a trail four feet in width may be cleared by cutting trees and removing brush along the trace of the Whiteside Turnpike where applicable for access.  No digging or removal of rocks will be permitted to allow access.  Special care should be taken when cutting and removing trees and brush in the vicinity of residences.  PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT BONDS ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS PROJECT (100% of the contract price).  Location: Chickamauga & Chattanooga National Military Park, P.O. Box 2128, Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia 30742.  Developed areas surrounding the park and in holding residential and industrial areas have developed into a Wildland Urban Interface sprawl.  This has created the need to develop defensible fuel breaks to reduce wild fire threats to the park and adjacent properties.  A fuel break 60 feet wide 1,500 feet long will be developed.  Much of the work will be conducted in sensitive areas.  In these area in particular there is a real possibility that unless the contractor is keenly aware irreversible damage could be done in completing this contract.  The contractor, along with the national park service district ranger will be responsible for marking the areas of tree work that will be done by hand because of it's in sensitive areas.  Special conditions required in these areas will be described in the contract. The following FAR provisions and clauses are applicable to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-01 Instructions to Offerors-- Commercial Items,  FAR 52.212-02 Evaluation of Commercial Items,  FAR 52.212-03 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items FAR 52.212-04, Contract Terms and Conditions-- Commercial Items,  FAR 52.212-05, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-- Commercial Items,  FAR 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities FAR 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity FAR 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, FAR 52.225-11 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases FAR 52.232-34 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other than Central Contractor  Liability Insurance-Department of Interior 1452.228-70 EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS: The Government will award to the responsible offeror based on 1.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML # 40012.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-22 dated 4/5/04. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis (LHBP performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing six bacterial pathogen genomes was performed towards achieving those goals. The LHBP has a need to purchase one Lot of the RML custom chips from Affymetrix. This chip is unique and specific to RML.  The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array.  RML processes the chips in Frederick, MD (NIAID) which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place at Frederick, MD. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Inside delivery shall be six(6)weeks after receipt of the order by Affymetrix.  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: (B)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation; 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors  Commercial; FAR52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions  Commercial Items; FAR 52-212.5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders  Commercial Items. FAR52.246-2 Inspection of Supplies-Fixed Price.    Offerors must include with their offer a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items.    Award will be based on the capability of the item offered to meet the above stated salient characteristics, delivery, price and past performance.

<DESC>This amendment is hereby issued to correct the following:  Interested sources can submit information detailing their capabilities to provide this particular transformer No Later Than 10:00am on 21 May 2004.  The information should include detail drawings and technical manuals.  Due to the urgency of this requirement the Government reserves the right to make an award on the first 2 autotransformers that are needed by June 11, 2004.   The remaining 9 autotransformers will be awarded after the drawings and technical data has been reviewed.  The questions raised are addressed as follows:

Question and Answers:

Q. What are test requirements or test report requirements?
    Is a short circuit test required?
 
A. Transformer to meet the testing requirements of IEEE STD C57.12.50 and IEC 60092-303.
 
Q. Does each transformer include two phase shifted outputs to feed two drives (VFD's)?
 
A.  The system being modified has one generator and two drives. The transformer will offset one drive by 30 degrees.  The transformer / two drive combination becomes the quasi 12 pulse system.
 
Q. What are the VFD ratings that will be connected to each transformer?
