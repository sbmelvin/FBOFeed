<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA/ATO) and the Air Force Research Laboratory, Sensors Directorate, (AFRL/SNKD), Wright Research Site are soliciting research proposals for the Tera Hertz Operational Reachback (THOR) Communications Program. This program will consist of three phases.  Proposals for Phase I to this effort will be due by no later than 30 Jan 02, 4:00 pm local time. Subsequent  amendments to this BAA for the soliciting of bids for Phases II and III will be issued in the CBD/EPS (under the "Modifications" section). The objective of the Terra  Hertz  Operational Reachback (THOR) Program is to provide secure, assured, high data rate and end-to-end communications to airborne, terrestrial, surface, and subsurface warfighters through optical system concepts and technologies. The requirement to send ever increasing amounts of military information between sensor platforms and information processing facilities for command and control purposes has begun to press the limits of present data links, even when data compression techniques are used.  The same is true when information is transferred from the command and control facilities to the various weapon platforms for mission planning and operations.  These two tasks have resulted in the development and fielding of numerous radio frequency (RF) data links in the past that were optimized for a specific platform without regard to interoperability with other data links or an overall communications architecture.The vision of the THOR Program is to demonstrate high bandwidth communications linking the battlefield with the global high-speed fiber communication grid.  This includes linking air, sea, land, and undersea defense assets into the high-speed global grid.  The terrestrial points of presence (PoP) for the global fiber grid may not be available in the theater of operations. The THOR Program is intended to develop and demonstrate under operational mission conditions the overall wideband communications architecture and the individual technologies within that architecture.Interested offerors may view and/or download the full BAA solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) homepage at http://www.eps.gov/.  Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

<DESC>AEFB Broad Agency Announcement FY03

A. BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA AEFB 03-0001) AIR EXPEDITIONARY FORCE BATTLELAB OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS. 
INTRODUCTION: The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB) invites concept papers with preliminary cost estimates on innovative Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) concepts.  This BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."  Concept papers in response to this announcement shall be submitted to: 
366 CONS/LGCB, marked for BAA AEFB-03-0001, 366 Gunfighter Ave, Bldg 512 Suite 498, Attn: TSgt Ralph Chavez, Mountain Home AFB ID 83648.  Electronic submission of concept papers may be made to matthew.olson@mountainhome.af.mil by attaching the document to e-mail.  Responses should reference the above BAA number and provide telephone and email contact information.  This announcement is open and effective until 30 SEP 03.  Concept papers in response to this announcement may be submitted at any time during this period.  There will be no other solicitation issued for this topic and offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.  Additionally, this BAA and all amendments and information related to this announcement will be posted electronically on the INTERNET at http://www.mountainhome.af.mil/AEFB and to the Federal Business Opportunities at http://www.eps.gov

B. OBJECTIVE: 
(1) Technical Description: The mission of the AEF Battlelab is to rapidly identify innovative and superior solutions to plan and employ AEF capabilities, organize and train forces for AEF operations, and influence AEF doctrine and tactics in order to meet current and emerging missions.  This BAA solicits innovative concept papers addressing operational solutions to Air Force AEF needs.  Submit concept papers that address improvements within any of the phases of AEF operations (readiness, deployment, employment, sustainment, redeployment, and reconstitution).  Submissions should describe the expected benefit in terms of how the concept would reduce support structure, reduce response time, and/or increase combat capability and effectiveness of an AEF.  These concept papers may include, but are not limited to: new tactics, techniques, procedures, and technology applications that may affect Air Force doctrine and strategy.  The proposed concept will be based on the demonstration of MATURING TECHNOLOGY.
(2) Security Requirements: Please contact 1Lt Mike Vigueria at (208) 828-3542 for any security concerns regarding the concept paper submissions.  
(3) Other Special Requirements: (a) DO NOT SUBMIT FULL PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME.  Proposals will be requested only if the AEFB has an interest in the concept, and funding is available for the effort.  (b) Successful offerors must comply with the Privacy Act, AFI 37-132.  (c) Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the government to an award under this BAA.  (d) If potential offerors have received this BAA by sources other than the Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, you are not guaranteed receipt of further information related to the AEFB Program or this BAA document. 

C. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Potential offerors are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number and reference number BAA AEFB 03-0001 with their submissions. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to apply.  Notice to Foreign Owned Firms: Such firms are asked to immediately notify the Air Force point of contact, TSgt Ralph Chavez at (208) 828-3109 or email to:  ralph.chavez@mountainhome.af.mil upon deciding to respond to this announcement.  Foreign contractors shall be aware that restrictions may apply which could preclude their participation in this program.

D. CONCEPT PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:  
The cost of preparing concept papers in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18.  Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the concept paper and any evaluations.  The submitter must mark the concept paper with a protective legend IAW FAR 3.104-5.  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or proposals are not desired.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to submit concept papers, not to exceed three (3) pages to the electronic addresses listed in section A of this announcement.  However, if you do not have the capability of transmitting the concept paper electronically, submit three (3) copies, not to exceed 3 pages, of the proposed concept to TSgt Ralph Chavez at the address in Section A of this BAA.  The concept paper shall be formatted as follows: 

Section A: Title, Submitter, Date, E-Mail Account, Phone#, Fax #, Organization/Office Symbol, Address; period of performance, Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost of effort; 
Section B: Problem Statement, Need Statement or Operational Impact statement which concisely summarizes how the product of the demonstration will enhance Air Force AEF operations;
Section C: Proposed Solution summarizing innovative concept and use of commercial or non-developmental items (NDI) to accomplish the demonstration;
Section D: Proposed Concept Demonstration concisely describing the demonstration and execution methodology; 
Section E:  Support Components required for the demonstration to include hardware, software, data, facilities and training;  
Section F: Expected Results, Benefits or Product of the demonstration; 
Section G: Proposed AF and DoD operational users of the concept; and 
Section H: Identify similar contracts to include the point of contact?s current telephone # and address.  For papers marked proprietary, the offeror shall submit a non-proprietary title and summary, not to exceed one (1) additional page.
Multiple concept papers addressing different research areas may be submitted by each offeror. However, each concept paper should address only one concept, or be divided into separately priced tasks which would allow the Government to easily procure individual tasks or combinations thereof.  The purpose of this concept paper is to preclude effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  Those concept papers found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a complete technical and cost proposal.  AN INVITATION BASED UPON A SUBMITTED CONCEPT PAPER DOES NOT ASSURE THAT THE OFFEROR WILL BE AWARDED A SUBSEQUENT CONTRACT. 

E. BASIS FOR AWARD: 
(1) Concept papers will be evaluated as they are received based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other concepts submitted under this announcement.  Concept papers will be evaluated under the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: (a) Impact of the proposed concept on one or more of the three Air Force Core Competencies (Developing Airmen, Technology-to-Warfighting, and Integrating Operations), (b) Technical merit of the proposed concept with an emphasis on novel, creative, and innovative solutions, (c) Realism and reasonableness of the proposed cost.  The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time during the evaluation process.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the concept papers.  
(2) Anticipated Period of Performance: Nominal duration of demonstrations will be up to 18 months from time of award through complete evaluation and demonstration of the operational concept.  The AEFB anticipates contract awards will be less than $500K.  However, some initiatives may require more resources depending on complexity and maturity of the concept.  Type of contract(s) expected: Firm-Fixed Price (Unless another contract type is determined by the contracting officer to be more appropriate).

<CONTACT>Peggy Dube, (508) 233-4481
<DESC>NA The US Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center, Natick Contract Division, in support of the U.S. Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command (USA SBCCOM), intends to conduct negotiations and award a purchase order to Englands Specialist Safety Equipment on the basis of other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation part 6.302-1.  This acquisition is being procured under the Department of Defense (DoD) Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program using DoD Directive 5000.3 -M-2.  For further information on the DoD FCT Program go to http://www.acq.osd.mil/fct   on the Internet. This acquisition is for the procurement of 45 Body Armor Floatation Vests (BAFV).  The Body Armor Flotation Vest must contain a positive buoyancy lift  rate with floatation duration time for 250lbs at 24hrs minimum with an objective of 72hrs.  The system must be able to self-right a 250lb soldier as a minimum with an objective of 350lbs.  The weight of a medium size vests with Body Armor/Load Carriage Sy stem (BALCS) Body Armor Subsystem hard armor plate is18.5lbs with an objective weight of 17.5lbs (floatation device included).  The weight requirement for a medium size vest without the BALCS hard armor plate is 8.5lbs minimum with an objective weight of 7 lbs (floatation device included).  It is our intent to have the flotation components integrated into the current  BALCS vest with the current soft and hard armor as part of the BAFV while still maintaining the functional configuration requirements such as the quick release and load carriage system configuration.  The objective is to have the floatation components incorporated into the BALCS vest and protected from ballistic penetration by the soft armor and the minimum threshold is to enhance the BALCS vest  by adding a flotation capability.  The soft armor for the BALCS vest/Collar provides NIJ IIIA and fragmentation protection equal to or greater than the Personnel Armor System Ground Troops (PASGT).  The flotation components should be capable of being re-a rmed and repacked by the user.  It must also have a dual option-arming mode that will enable the user to manually override the automatic employment of the floatation device to manual inflation.  The final configuration color of the vest is woodland camoufl age and three-color day desert.   Under the requirements of the FCT Program a 45-day Market Research was conducted on the Federal Businss Opportunities (FBO) webpage.  Englands Specialist Safety Equipment is the only source that provided a sample that meet s the basic requirements.  Additional test articles are required to conduct further testing to verify additional threshold flotation and operational requirements.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  However, the Government will consider all quotations received within three (3) days after date of publication of this announcement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will  be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U. S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center, Natick Cont racting Division, ATTN:  AMSSB-ACN-S/Peggy Dube, Natick, MA  01760-5011 no later than 5:00 p.m. ESTon 21 Feb 2003.  Inquiries may be made via e-mail to peggy.dube@natick.army.mil.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.  See FBO Note 22.

<CONTACT>DENIS S. THARP, Contract Specialist, Phone: (513) 487-2092, E-Mail: Tharp.Scott@epa.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12, the EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (Ann Arbor, Michigan) will procure a Tier 2 Sampling, Measurement, and Control Systems. As part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, a variety of new emissions regulations have been implemented for vehicles and engines.  Tier 2, NMOG, SULEV, OBD II on-board diagnostics, and Supplemental FTP are a few examples of test changes that require sophisticated and adaptable emission measurement systems.  The EPA NVFEL has undertaken a comprehensive program to implement new and refined test systems to enhance the capabilities to conduct low level emissions testing, of the highest precision and accuracy, on a broad range of vehicles.  The Statement of Work (SOW) describes the engineering and operational requirements for measurement systems that will be required for implementing these enhanced capabilities.  The equipment implementation described in the SOW is comprised of two complete measurement systems for two separate chassis test sites at the NVFEL, D329 and D005, and a partial upgrade of the existing measurement system for a third chassis test site, D002.  These measurement systems shall be used to evaluate both regulated emissions and currently unregulated emissions from spark ignition motor vehicles operating in a variety of ambient conditions and on a variety of fuels including those currently considered as "alternative".  The SOW addresses requirements to optimize the measurement of emissions at Tier 2 levels. For the equipment specified, the contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project, design, configuration, fabrication, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation and training of EPA staff.  The contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement traceability and system acceptance in a manner suitable for audit to ISO standards. D329 Light/Medium Duty, FWD/RWD/4WD Test Site Overview This will be a new test site at NVFEL, intended to provide a wide range of test capabilities.  It will house a medium duty / 4 wheel drive dynamometer intended to test a wide range of vehicles with from 1000 to 14,000 pounds of simulated inertia per roll set, with single or dual drive axles, fueled by gasoline, oxygenated fuels, alcohol fuels, gaseous fuels and diesel or other high-cetane fuels. The measurement system shall support protocols such as Tier2 level FTP, US06, HFET and others. The core requirement of this contract shall be to configure, build and implement a complete sampling and measurement system for this test site.  This system shall provide for test sequencing and control, exhaust sampling and analysis, data acquisition and data analysis, processing and file transfer, along with a variety of tools for maintenance calibration and support activities. The system shall provide both CFV-CVS and Exhaust Flow Measurement System (EFMS) Bag Mini-Diluter (BMD) sampling for regulated gaseous emissions, as well as aldehyde and particulate sampling for all fuels, and alcohol sampling via impinger.  The associated analytical system shall provide for direct on-site analysis of Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide, Oxygen, Hydrocarbon, Methane, Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), Methanol, Ethanol and Formaldehyde.   The dynamometer and video driver's aide equipment for this will be provided by others, but integration with these subsystems shall be included as part of the work described in the SOW.  Dynamometer and Driver's Aide interface requirements are outlined in Appendices to the SOW. The contractor shall deliver a system capable of the measurement, calculation, and reporting of the mass emissions from motor vehicles in accordance with the emissions standards and regulations referenced in the SOW.  The system shall provide the necessary software to calculate the emissions from both the CVS and EFMS/BMD systems.   This procurement will include two options. D005 Light Duty Test Site (OPTION 1) This test site houses an existing 48" roll electric dynamometer and older test control, data acquisition and sampling and analytical systems.  The contractor shall provide a sampling and measurement system to replace the existing cell control, data acquisition and sampling and analytical systems at this site.  This site shall be used to test light duty cars and trucks at the lowest levels of Tier 2 fueled by gasoline and similar fuels. The existing dynamometer and EPA video driver's aide shall be utilized.  This measurement system will not include requirements to sample and measure particulate matter, oxygenates, aldehyde or alcohol.   D002 Light Duty Test Site (OPTION 2) This site houses an existing 48 inch roll electric dynamometer as well as a low level emissions measurement system described in the SOW.  This measurement system is approximately two (2) years old and contains many of the features required for the D005 system described above, with the exception of the EFMS/BMD.  The contractor shall provide for the full integration of a bag mini-diluter sampling system, as provided in the D005 system, with the existing D002 measurement system. This procurement will be made using "Best Value" evaluation criteria and Full and Open Competition for everything in the SOW including Options. The solicitation should be issued by March 5, 2003 on our website.  A "DRAFT" of the proposed Statement of Work for this requirement can be found at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  Interested parties are invited to review the "DRAFT" SOW and provide any comments by February 28, 2003 via fax to Scott Tharp (513) 487-2107 or email at Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.

<DESC>A--Maintain Collections of Living Reference Strains of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis (on behalf of the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)) with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) for the acquisition, preservation, authentication, and distribution of biomedically relevant, taxonomically related cells, microorganisms, viruses, and DNA materials as Collections.  NIH has continuously contracted with ATCC since 1974 for these services.  This requirement is for an additional four years.  The ATCC is a non-profit organization established in 1925 and is this country's only long-term repository and distribution center which functions as a "museum" for living microorganisms, viruses, cell lines and DNA, plus other reagents.  By collecting, certifying to their purity and authenticity, propagating, distributing, and referencing such materials, ATCC provides invaluable research support vital to the advancement of biomedical research.  The repository functions of the ATCC are essential to NCRR's mission of providing a number of diverse research sources to biomedical researchers.  Authenticated cultures are the principal starting materials for much biomedical research.  If such cultures are not available, or if they are contaminated or incorrectly identified, there would be a considerable waste of research time and funds.  NIH knows of no other organization that can provide these services.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Interested respondents must submit written capability statements demonstrating the ability to provide the same repository materials and distribution center, as well as the facilities and staffing to perform these services, described above.  Responses providing insufficient information will not be considered.  This is not a Request For Proposals.  See Numbered Note 22.

The scope of work includes all items sole source listed in the Hellan Fluid Strainer commercial catalogue.  If we identify other NSNs we believe to be sole source to either Cleveland Gear (59958) or Hellan Strainer (1QZK3).  We will synopsize them at that time.  If anyone is able to quote an item and the Government determines that item is no longer sole source, that item will be deleted from this procurement.  This proposed procurement contains and option to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the Government.  The total duration (base plus option years) shall not exceed 7 years. This is for a Long Term Contract Indefinite Quantity Contract.  Solicitation will be able in Fedbizops on its issue date of March 05, 2003.  See note 26. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.  This acquisition is for supplies for which the government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract only with approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c).  Approved sources are Federal Resources (1Q3Z9).  While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit and offer/quote which shall be considered.

<DESC>This shall serve as the official pre-solicitation notice for an independent third party assessment of product safety validation and verification for the Illinois Department of Transportation Positive Train Control (IDOT PTC) project, Build 2.  The IDOT PTC project is currently in the critical design review phase and will field test the Build 2 implementation during mid 2003.  Once validation and verification efforts are complete and Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Office of Safety approval has been attained, the Build 2 system will be put into revenue operation on high speed passenger trains on a 120 mile corridor in Illinois.  Prior to granting approval, the FRA requires completion of an independent third party safety assessment of the PTC System Development and Integration (SDI) work.
The third party assessment must be performed in accordance with the FRA?s Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) published in the Federal Register on August 10, 2001, ?Standards for Development and Use of Processor-Based Signal and Train Control Systems?.  The purpose of the assessment along with general requirements and descriptions of what must be done are defined in Appendix D of the NPRM.

The period of performance will be approximately nine months from issuance of Notice to Proceed.  These documents total approximately 10,000 pages, not including schematics and software listings.  Schematics to be assessed include onboard computer, onboard display, vital locomotive interface module, location determination system (including GPS and inertial navigation equipment), and various types of vital wayside interface units.  The total amount of safety critical software being developed is approximately 200,000 lines of source code, distributed over central office, wayside, and onboard (locomotive and hi-rail vehicle) segments.  A randomly selected subset of the software modules is to be audited.
Prospective offerors must respond in the form of a Statement of Interest and Qualifications.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This modification is issued to replace Paragraph 3.2.2 in the Statement of Work as follows: 3.2.2     Splicing shall be accomplished with a re-useable, mechanical crimp style connector.  To minimize part count and maximize flexibility, the connector shall have the ability to splice FO cables that range in size from 250 microns to 1200 microns.  The splice shall have a viewing port to allow for the verification of proper fiber alignment prior to securing the splice, by means of a light source at the cable end connector.  Splice shall be accomplished by mechanical crimping or closing, by special tool if necessary.  The splice shall be removable, by special tool if necessary, and reusable when testing indicates unacceptable signal loss. To protect the splice, a protective cover shall be provided to seal the splice from combat and environmental conditions.  A cover shall be capabl e of protecting up to six (6) splices simultaneously on a cable (i.e., repairing a cable with up to six (6) fiber strands within the cable). The cover shall allow for cable burial.  The cover shall provide mechanical support to the splice to maintain the integrity of the splice during combat handling conditions and possess enough flexibility to allow for spooling without protruding and creating a sharp bend-point condition for the cable.  All other terms and conditons remian unchanged

<DESC>Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC (BBWI), P.O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-4142.  COLLECTION AND DISPOSITION OF INEEL SANITARY SOLID WASTE AND SELECT NON-HAZARDOUS AND NON-RADIOACTIVE INDUSTRIAL WASTE STREAMS.  Contact Mr. Scott Drewes.  BBWI, a managing and operating contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), is seeking an expression of interest from firms to provide waste collection and disposition services for a variety of the INEEL?s non-hazardous and non-radioactive waste streams.  Disposal of the wastes shall be at an appropriately licensed and/or permitted landfill facility located outside of areas managed by DOE.  The solid waste streams to be managed under this scope of work shall include office trash, including paper, cardboard, and similar materials; cafeteria wastes; non-hazardous/non-radioactive industrial wastes suitable for disposal in a municipal Subtitle D landfill facility; asbestos; and petroleum contaminated material (PCM) including soil, gravel, etc.  The proposed scope of work will include on-site waste verification and radiological screening activities to ensure waste items not specifically allowed for such disposition are not present in the waste containers.  This scope of work specifically excludes the management of all other INEEL wastes including RCRA hazardous wastes, radioactive wastes, sanitary wastewaters, unpainted/untreated wood, rubble, asphalt, scrap metal, dirt and gravel (other than PCM), and sensitive materials.  Vendors shall supply the necessary dumpsters and/or roll-off containers to collect the waste and provide transportation services to the final disposal facility.  All proposed disposal facilities shall be subject to approval by BBWI.  Waste must be picked up from designated collection points at each of the INEEL operating facilities according to a specified schedule.  Based on current operations, it is estimated that there are approximately 200 dumpsters in use at the INEEL for the collection of the specified waste streams.  Based on past generation rates, it is estimated that approximately 27,000 m3 of these wastes will be generated annually.  Specific detailed dumpster locations and quantities as well as waste generation estimate data will be provided in the Request for Budgetary Estimate when issued.  The contractor shall perform work under documented Health and Safety Plans and Quality Assurance Plans, have personnel conducting work at the INEEL facility cleared through the DOE security process, and conduct all work in accordance with INEEL site procedures and applicable State and Federal regulations.  Development of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the management of these waste streams under contract(s) will be contingent on the financial feasibility of the project based on a review of the budgetary estimates and availability of necessary funding.  The RFP, if developed, will include detailed information concerning anticipated waste stream volumes and weights, and specific administrative and regulatory requirements applicable to the scope of work.  Qualified respondents must provide two printed copies of the following information:  company name, address, point of contact, email, phone/fax numbers and a concise summary report that describes the capabilities of the respondent and a listing of all similar recent activities complete with reference names and telephone numbers, and copies of licenses and permits held applicable to transport of this waste.  Respondents who provide insufficient information will not be considered further. The expression of interest is totally separate from all other solicitations involving the management of INEEL wastes.  Firms interested in responding should forward the requisite information to: Mr. Scott Drewes, Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC, P.O. Box 1625, Mail Stop 4142, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-4142.  Responses by email, fax, or telephone will be considered nonresponsive.  This solicitation will close on March 7, 2003

<SUBJECT>99--IMPORTANT NOTICE TO VENDORS
<DESC>SUBJECT:	 Implementation of the Integrated Financial Management Program (IFMP), Core Financial Module		 This special notice contains extremely important information regarding payment of any invoices you may be planning to submit to NASA John C. Stennis Space Center (SSC) in the May 2003 timeframe. SSC will be shutting down its financial systems in May to implement a new Integrated Financial Management System (IFMP), an agency-wide initiative to modernize its financial and administrative systems and processes.	The implementation may result in some payment delays.   SSC is scheduled to shutdown our legacy financial systems on May 23, 2003 and begin using the Core Financial module of IFMP in June 2003.  During the interim period, NASA SSC will be conducting cutover activities and may be unable to make payments on invoices received from vendors.  Therefore, as a part of our cutover activities for Core Financial, we are encouraging vendors, where possible, to submit invoices for completed work no later than May 09, 2003.  NASA SSC will make every effort to pay all approved invoices that are received by May 09, 2003 prior to shutdown of our legacy financial system.  However, those invoices not received and approved by May 09, 2003 may not be paid until after NASA SSC successfully implements Core Financial.  Please keep in mind that NASA cannot honor invoices requesting advance payment for goods and services to be received during the transition period. The SSC Business Management Directorate's, Financial and Acquisition Management Offices will be working with you to maintain continuity of service since payment processing will be interrupted during our cutover window.  We do need your cooperation in this effort and ask for your patience as we transition to the new financial management system. If you have any questions or require further details, please contact David Keith of the NASA SSC Acquisition Management Office at (228) 688-3562, Batrina Street of the NASA Office of the Chief Financial Officer at (228) 688-1628 or your NASA SSC Contracting Officer.
