part is unstable. Engineering, manufacturing, or performance characteristics
indicate that the required design objectives have not been achieved. Major
changes are contemplated because the part has a low process yield or has
demonstrated marginal performance during tests or service use. These changes
will render the present part obsolete and unusable in its present configuration.
Limited acquisition from the present source is anticipated pending configuration
changes. Interested parties may obtain copies of Military and Federal
Specifications and Standards, Qualified Products Lists (QPLs), Qualified Product
Databases (QPDs), Military Handbooks, and other standardized documents from the
DoD Single Stock Point (DODSSP) at Document Automation and Production Service
(DAPS) in Philadelphia, PA. NOTE: Patterns, Drawings, Deviation Lists, Purchase
Descriptions, etc. are NOT stocked at DODSSP. Most documents are available in
Adobe PDF format from ASSIST-Online at: https://assist.dla.mil. Users may use
ASSIST-Quick Search to search for and download available documents directly
using standard browser software. Documents that are not available for
downloading from ASSIST-Quick Search can be ordered from the DODSSP website
using the ASSIST Shopping Wizard after obtaining a DODSSP Customer Account by
following the registration procedures. Users who do not have access to the
internet may contact the DODSSP ASSIST Help Desk at 215-697-6396 (DSN:

?Registered in the SAM database? means that?
  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 
  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.
(End of Clause) <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal Criminal Tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have" the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??????6212,which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMCLevel Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp.

<DESC> <br> Notice to All Interested Vendors (25 April 2015):  If you have questions regarding Broad Agency Announcement W911NF-13-R-0001 or any white paper solicitation associated with W911NF-13-R-0001, please submit your question(s) in writing to the ACC (APG) RTP Point of Contact, Maria D. Nelson, at maria.d.nelson.civ@mail.mil.  This process helps expedite responses to your question(s) in lieu of telephonic inquiries.     <br>  <br> Notice to All Interested Vendors (11 March 2015):  Broad Agency Announcement W911NF-13-R-0001 is active and open through 5 February 2018.  The announcement has not been cancelled.  There was a notice with the same announcement number cancelled on FedBizOpps on 9 August 2014 due to a Contracting Officer entry error.  The Broad Agency Announcement description for W911NF-13-R-0001 is as follows:       <br>       <br>   The U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI) announces the ARI FY13-18 Broad Agency Announcement for Basic, Applied, and Advanced Scientific Research.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), which sets forth research areas of interest to the United States Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which provides for the competitive selection of proposals.  Proposals submitted in response to this BAA and selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369 (The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984) and subsequent amendments.     <br>          <br>   The U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences is the Army's lead agency for the conduct of research, development, and analyses for the improvement of Army readiness and performance via research advances and applications of the behavioral and social sciences that address personnel, organization, training, and leader development issues.  Programs funded under this BAA include basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development that can improve human performance and Army readiness.  The funding opportunity is divided into two sections- (1) Basic Research and (2) Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development.  The four major topic areas of research interest include the following:  (1) Training; (2) Leader Development; (3) Team and Inter-Organizational Performance in Complex Environments; and (4) Solider/Personnel Issues.       <br>          <br>   Funding of research and development (R&D) within ARI areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during each budget cycle.  Those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the ARI Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) identified in Part II Section G of this BAA or the responsible ARI Manager noted at the end of the technical area entry (Part II Section A of this BAA) to determine whether the R&D warrants further inquiry.  If the R&D warrants further inquiry and funding is available, submission of a proposal will be entertained.  The recommended three-step sequence is (1) telephone call to the ARI TPOC or responsible ARI Manager, (2) white paper submission, (3) full proposal submission.  Awards may be made in the form of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements.       <br>          <br>   Proposals are sought from educational institutions, non-profit/not-for-profit organizations, and commercial organizations, domestic or foreign, for research and development (R&D) in those areas specified in Part II Section A of this BAA.  The U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences encourages Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Other Minority Serving Institutions (HBCU/MI) (FAR Part 26.3) small businesses, and small disadvantaged businesses (FAR Part 19) to submit proposals for consideration.  Foreign owned, controlled, or influenced organizations are advised that security restrictions may apply that could preclude their participation in these efforts.  Government laboratories, Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and US Service Academies are not eligible to participate as prime contractors or recipients.

Nelson, at maria.d.nelson.civ@mail.mil.  This process helps expedite responses to your question(s) in lieu of telephonic inquiries.  The full announcement can be accessed by clicking on the Solicitation 1, Amendment 1, and Amendment 2 links in the right margin of this page.  The full announcement lists and describes the topics of interest and cites the contact information for the associated Technical Point of Contact for each topic.  All questions of a technical nature should be directed to the respective Technical Point of Contact.  All questions of a business nature should be directed to the ACC (APG) RTP Point of Contact.       <br>    <br> Notice to All Interested Vendors (11 March 2015):  Broad Agency Announcement W911NF-13-R-0001 is active and open through 5 February 2018.  The announcement has not been cancelled.  There was a notice with the same announcement number cancelled on FedBizOpps on 9 August 2014 due to a Contracting Officer entry error.  The Broad Agency Announcement description for W911NF-13-R-0001 is as follows:        <br>         <br>    The U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI) announces the ARI FY13-18 Broad Agency Announcement for Basic, Applied, and Advanced Scientific Research.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), which sets forth research areas of interest to the United States Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which provides for the competitive selection of proposals.  Proposals submitted in response to this BAA and selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369 (The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984) and subsequent amendments.      <br>            <br>    The U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences is the Army's lead agency for the conduct of research, development, and analyses for the improvement of Army readiness and performance via research advances and applications of the behavioral and social sciences that address personnel, organization, training, and leader development issues.  Programs funded under this BAA include basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development that can improve human performance and Army readiness.  The funding opportunity is divided into two sections- (1) Basic Research and (2) Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development.  The four major topic areas of research interest include the following:  (1) Training; (2) Leader Development; (3) Team and Inter-Organizational Performance in Complex Environments; and (4) Solider/Personnel Issues.        <br>            <br>    Funding of research and development (R&D) within ARI areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during each budget cycle.  Those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the ARI Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) identified in Part II Section G of this BAA or the responsible ARI Manager noted at the end of the technical area entry (Part II Section A of this BAA) to determine whether the R&D warrants further inquiry.  If the R&D warrants further inquiry and funding is available, submission of a proposal will be entertained.  The recommended three-step sequence is (1) telephone call to the ARI TPOC or responsible ARI Manager, (2) white paper submission, (3) full proposal submission.  Awards may be made in the form of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements.        <br>            <br>    Proposals are sought from educational institutions, non-profit/not-for-profit organizations, and commercial organizations, domestic or foreign, for research and development (R&D) in those areas specified in Part II Section A of this BAA.  The U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences encourages Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Other Minority Serving Institutions (HBCU/MI) (FAR Part 26.3) small businesses, and small disadvantaged businesses (FAR Part 19) to submit proposals for consideration.  Foreign owned, controlled, or influenced organizations are advised that security restrictions may apply that could preclude their participation in these efforts.  Government laboratories, Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and US Service Academies are not eligible to participate as prime contractors or recipients.  However, they may be able to participate as subcontractors or subrecipients (eligibility will be determined on a case by case basis).        <br>            <br>            <br>    This BAA may be accessed from the following websites:       <br>            <br>    https://www.fbo.gov        <br>            <br>    http://www.grants.gov      <br>            <br>            <br>            <br>            <br>            <br>              <br>

Selection of firms for discussions/interviews/negotiations shall be made by a Pre-selection Board by evaluation of the PRIMARY SELECTION CRITERIA listed below.

PRIMARY SELECTION CRITERIA in Order of Preference:  Note: Failure to address all selection criteria in sufficient detail will result in a low a rating or exclusion.  Selection criteria (See FAR Subpart 36.6 and VA Acquisition regulation 836.6) as follows:
1.	Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required service.  A board will evaluate, as appropriate, the education, training, registration, certifications overall and relevant experience, and longevity with the firm of the key management and technical personnel. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel. The lead designer in each discipline must be registered as required by FAR 36.609-4 and 52.236-25.
2.	Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials. A board will evaluate the specialized experience on similar projects and the technical capabilities (such as design quality management procedures, CADD, equipment resources, and laboratory requirements) of the prime firm and any subcontractors. The Board will evaluate where appropriate the effectiveness of the proposed project team (including management structure; coordination of disciplines, offices and/or subcontractors; and prior working relationships) will also be examined.  Specialized experience in design/renovation of VA Hospitals/Clinics and Hospitals/Clinics is weighted favorably.
3.	Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  A board may consider more favorably a firm's experience in projects similar or greater in scope, size and magnitude and the available capacity of key disciplines when evaluating the capacity of a firm to perform the work in the required time. The board will consider the full potential value of any current A/E contracts that a firm has been awarded when evaluating capacity.
4.	Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  Information obtained for Government Past Performance Information Systems may be accessed and utilized in the evaluation process.
5.	Location in general geographical area of the projects and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of the criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.  Examples of knowledge of the locality include knowledge of geological features, climatic conditions or local construction methods that are unusual or unique.  
6.	Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness. The SF 330 must address these criteria.
7.	Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.  The SF 330 shall contain a signed and dated statement affirming that that there are no records of significant claims because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.
8.	Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team. 
9.	The area of consideration for an Offeror is a 750 Mile driving radius between principal  business address listed in VETBIZ and the Orlando VA Medical Center, 5201 Raymond Street, Orlando FL 32803.  Determination of mileage eligibility will be based on www.mapquest.com and the principle business address associated with the SDVOSB vendor's address listed in VETBIZ.

<DONBR>TIRNO15P00109
<DESC><p><br />On March 26, 2015 the IRS awarded a purchase number TIRNO15-P-00109 to EMC of McLean, VA under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1):For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. (i) Contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). The Review Return Program (RRP) utilizes massively parallel processing (MPP) technology to perform advanced computing function on very large datas ts known as big data. The MPP technology platform is known as a Data Computing Appliance (DCA) which was manufactured, purchased, and installed at the IRS by the vendor EMC. The current DCA configuration provides multi-functional processing which has resulted in critical work stoppages due to system resource contentions between competing processes. Because of this issue, an executive decision was made to re-locate one of the DCAs. Because of repair or replacement costs of the DCA, timeliness and expertise to deliver and bring the system online, and warranty requirements, IRS requests that EMC be selected as the sole source vendor to ship the DCA. There is substantial business impact of not delivering this DCA or its replacement to Martinsburg with a POP of is 3/26/15- 4/30/15. Please also note that the warranty would be voided unless the vendor, EMC, is used for this task. The current processing that needs to be re-located to the DCA that is being shipped is not being utilized at full capacity. EMC is the only vendor that provides a high level of confidence of de-installing, shipping, delivering, and re-installing this DCA timely.</p>
