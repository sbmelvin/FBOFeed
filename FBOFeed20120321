This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8253. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable.

<DESC><p>This is a synopsis of proposed contract action FA4452-12-R-0002 (formerly listed under FA4452-11-R-0014). This is not a solicitation or invitation for offerors to submit proposals. This notice will be posted for a minimum of seven days prior to posting of the solicitation.<br /><br />This effort will be in the form of technical and support tasks associated with the infrastructure and applications support, information assurance, testing, configuration management, and training in support of the Mobility Air Force Command and Control and In-Transit Visibility (MAF C2, ITV)/Business Systems. Current AISS programs include Advanced Computer Flight Plan (ACFP), Commercial Operations Integrated System (COINS), Consolidated Air Mobility Planning System (CAMPS), Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES), Global Command and Control System (GCCS), Global Decision Support System (GDSS), Enterprise Information Management (EIM), and Systems Integration (SI).<br /><br />The Government plans to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) for Applications, Infrastructure and Systems Support, Increment 2 (AISS II) services for programs within HQ AMC/A6. The Government intends to issue the RFP on or around 2 May 12. An Industry Day/Bid Library is tentatively planned for the middle of May 2012. Firm dates will be posted to FedBizOpps as soon as they are determined. This acquisition will be set-aside for small business (small business must accomplish at least 51% of the services performed). The Government intends to establish a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) single-award contract. <br /><br />A tradeoff process will be used for this source selection IAW FAR 15.101-1, Tradeoff Process and FAR 15.3, Source Selection, as supplemented by DFARS and AFFARS. The Government will select the best overall offer, based upon an integrated assessment of Technical/Technical Risk, Past Performance, and Price. The Government seeks to award the offeror who gives the Air Force the greatest confidence that it will best meet, or exceed, the PWS requirements. This may result in a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors, and the SSA reasonably determines that the technical and/or past performance of the higher price offeror outweighs the cost difference.<br /><br />The offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them. If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.<br /><br />The planned period of performance is as follows:<br /><br />Base Period (1 Jan 13 - 30 Sep 13)<br />Option Period 1 (1 Oct 13 - 30 Sep 14)<br />Option Period 2 (1 Oct 14 - 30 Sep 15)<br />Option Period 3 (1 Oct 15 - 30 Sep 16)<br />Option Period 4 (1 Oct 16 - 31 Dec 16)<br /><br />Please note that all dates listed in this synopsis are tentative and are subject to change.</p>

<DESC>The contract ceiling for the cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF)/firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract with Joint Venture Yulista Management Services Incorporated and Science and Engineering Services Incorporated (JVYS) in support of the Government Owned and Government Operated (GOGO) Larry O. Daniel Prototype Integration Facility (PIF), Redstone Arsenal, AL has been exhausted more rapidly than anticipated.  The US Army Contracting Command, AMCOM Contracting Center, anticipates a modification to Contract DAAH01-02-C-R190, to increase the maximum ordering ceiling as an interim measure until such time as a follow-on contract can be awarded.  The award of the follow-on contract is anticipated in May 2012.  The modification to DAAH01-02-C-R190 is necessary to maintain uninterrupted support for aviation, missile, and technology activities in the development, fabrication, integration, test and qualification of prototype tactical and ground support systems, subsystems and components.  Under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B), "Only one Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Service Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", this contract modification shall be awarded on an other than full and open competition basis to JVYS.  Until a follow-on contract can be awarded, award to other than JVYS during this interim period will result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and will cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the PIF's mission to provide rapid acquisition, rapid response and rapid prototyping capabilities.  All responsible sources may submit a response which shall be considered.  All responses should be directed to Ms. Christie Honeycutt at christie.honeycutt@us.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days of this notice. This notice of intent to issue a sole source modification to contract DAAH01-02-C-R190 is not a request for competitive proposals. This is not a formal notice of solicitation. Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted. See Note: 22.

This plan provides for monitoring all contract requirements through checklist surveillance.<br><br>1.2 The objective of this surveillance plan is to evaluate how the contractor is performing in key areas. The government is primarily interested in the final product or service the contractor is providing and not in details of how he is doing it.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>HOW TO USE THE SURVEILLANCE PLAN<br><br>2.1 The QAE is responsible for using the surveillance plan.<br><br>2.2 It is the QAE's responsibility to perform monthly surveillance to verify contract tasks are being satisfactorily performed in compliance with contract specifications. The checklist included at Section 4 of this plan will be used to record information pertaining to each inspection. The Contracting Officer must be able to observe the QAE's performance by review of these monthly inspection checklists. The government should be able to conduct a complete audit trail from the monthly inspection checklists and an auditor or inspector should be able to track from the above checklist to the contract administrator's actions, payment deductions or other actions as necessary, described on a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR).<br><br>2.3 Checklists will be prepared for each inspection and will be used to record information on observation and defects. These documents will then become a formal government record for later reference. Discrepancies detected during the course of surveillance will require corrective action by the contractor. Specifics concerning any errors should be recorded on the back of the checklists. The QAE should verbally tell the contractor's representative when discrepancies are found and ask him to correct the problem. A notation will be made on the checklist of the date and time the deficiency was discovered and the date and time the contractor's representative was notified. The contractor's representative should be asked to initial this entry.<br><br>2.4 If at the conclusion of the month's inspection, the contractor's performance is judged unsatisfactory due to his failure to correct deficiencies and/or failure to comply with the contract specifications, the contractor will be given a CDR. The QAE will prepare the CDR for signature of and release by the Contracting Officer. When completed and signed, the CDR along with the monthly checklists become documentation supporting payment, reduced payment, nonpayment or other actions as necessary. At the end of each month the QAE shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing if contract performance was satisfactory or unsatisfactory. Unsatisfactory determination requires written documentation to include inspection checklists to support the unsatisfactory rating. Recommended deductions in payment will include the method used to compute the proposed amount.<br><br>2.5 During the course of the month, the QAE may receive customer complaints about the quality of service. Procedures for the use of the customer complaint record are at Section 3. Each complaint received shall be validated by the QAE.<br><br>2.6 Revisions to this surveillance plan are the joint responsibility of the QAE and the Contracting Officer.<br><br>Section 3<br><br>CUSTOMER COMPLAINT GUIDE<br><br>3.1 Complaints will be used as additional evidence that performance was lacking. Complaints will not, in themselves, be counted against the contractor's performance standards for purposes of payment deductions.<br><br>3.2 When a complaint is received, the QAE will complete a customer complaint record (see 3.4) and investigate the complaint. If the QAE is satisfied the complaint is valid, he will notify the contractor of the defect. The contractor will be required to correct valid complaints of performance not in compliance with the contract.<br><br>3.3 The QAE will retain the complaint form in the QAE files. At the end of each month a copy of all validated complaints will be forwarded to the Contracting Officer.<br><br>3.4 Customer Complaint Record<br> <br>CUSTOMER COMPLAINT RECORD<br><br><br><br>DATE AND TIME OF COMPLAINT:<br><br><br><br>SOURCE OF COMPLAINT:<br><br><br><br>NATURE OF COMPLAINT:<br><br><br><br>VALID COMPLAINT: 		YES ( ) 	NO ( )<br><br><br><br>CONTRACT REFERENCE:<br><br><br><br>DATE AND TIME CONTRACTOR NOTIFIED OF COMPLAINT:<br><br><br><br>ACTION TAKEN BY CONTRACTOR:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>RECEIVED AND VALIDATED BY:<br> <br>Section 4<br><br>SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITY CHECKLIST<br><br>4.1 Surveillance of services will be conducted by use of surveillance activity checklist.

This plan is to be used in conjunction with the Quality Assurance Evaluator's Surveillance Plan.<br><br>1.2 While the QAE may inspect the contractor's performance and document noncompliance actions, only the Contracting Officer may take formal action against the contractor for unsatisfactory performance. Section 2 of this plan "Government Actions for Contractor Deficiencies" lists actions to be taken by the Contracting Officer when contractor deficiencies are discovered.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>GOVERNMENT ACTIONS FOR CONTRACTOR DEFICIENCIES<br><br>2.1 The actions listed below are the normal steps to be taken when the contractor's performance is found deficient by the QAE. When the contractor's performance fails to conform to the requirements of the contract and formal action is contemplated, the QAE, the functional area chief and the Contracting Officer will meet to determine if the action is appropriate for the specific circumstances. If a decision is reached not to take the action listed, the reasons will be documented. The Contracting Officer must indicate agreement with the decision by signing the Contract Discrepancy Report or other decision documentation.<br><br>2.2 Normally, the QAE will verbally tell the contractor's project manager of discrepancies the first time and ask the contractor to correct the problem. A notation will be made on the tally checklist of the date and time the deficiency was discovered and the date, the time and the name of the contractor's project manager notified.<br><br>2.3 When the contractor is responsible for unsatisfactory performance, a contract discrepancy report (CDR) will be issued to the contractor. The seriousness of the problems should govern whether to issue the CDR at the end of the month or as soon as the problems are discovered. Any discrepancies caused by the government will not be counted against the contractor's performance. When the government has caused the contractor to perform in an unsatisfactory manner, a letter will be written to the responsible government organization requesting corrective action is taken.<br>2.4 When services to be performed by the contractor are of such a nature that the defect cannot be corrected by re-performance of the services, the government will have the right to require the contractor to take immediate steps to ensure future performance of services are in conformity with contractual requirements and to reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.<br><br>2.5 If the contractor fails to achieve satisfactory performance by the end of the next month or agreed suspense date, another CDR will be issued and the appropriate amount deducted from the contractor's payment. A third CDR should be the cause for consideration of a cure notice.<br><br>2.6 Depending on the overall performance of the contractor, an unsatisfactory reply to a cure notice should require issuance of a show cause letter followed by consideration to terminate the contract.<br><br> <br>Section 3<br><br>SURVEILLANCE OF THE QUALITY ASSURANCE EVALUATOR (QAE)<br><br>3.1 The Contracting Officer's check of the QAE will be done by joint surveillance with the QAE.<br><br>3.2 Surveillance will be accomplished through periodic review of the QAE's checklist. Checklist items must be reviewed at least once a year with the QAE. A record of the surveillance will be made and the record will become a permanent part of the Contracting Officer's file. The contract administrator may make independent reviews of the contractor's performance.<br><br>3.3 The amount of surveillance specified will provide the Contracting Officer with sufficient "direct loss" knowledge of the contractor's performance to promote sound decisions if government actions are indicated. This surveillance should ensure the Contracting Officer of the QAE's performance.<br><br>3.4 During the surveillance checks, the Contracting Officer will verify that the QAE is performing inspections in accordance with the QAE's surveillance plan. Observations of one or two checks will be sufficient to verify the QAE's procedures. If defects are discovered in the QAE's performance, the Contracting Officer will notify the functional area chief and ensure the QAE receives the proper training.<br>

<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement to extend the performance period of the DFRC SecuritySupport Services Contract for two (2) months (April 1, 2012 - May 31, 2012) plus four (4)one-month option periods for a potential maximum period of six (6) months (April 1, 2012- September 30, 2012).	A contract modification reflecting this extension will be issuedon or before March 31, 2012, which is the expiration date of the current security supportservices contract. NASA DFRC intends to extend the period of performance of contractNND04AC17D, for protective services which was awarded November 1, 2004, as a result offull and open competition under a GSA Schedule to Wackenhut Services, Inc. (WSI) (namedchanged to G4S Government Solutions Inc. (G4S) in October 2011). This extension isnecessary to bridge the performance period between the end of the current contract andaward of a new NASA Dryden Protective Service contract. The current contractor, G4S, is considered the only contractor that can meet DFRC's needsgiven the potentially short period of performance for the extension.  Award to anothersource at the same time that the evaluation of contractor proposals received in supportof the competitive recompetition is in process would result in substantial duplication ofcost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition of theextension and would not allow for a sufficient phase-in period, thereby affecting thecontinuity of services and causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling DFRCs requirements.Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit theircapabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified pointof contact not later than 4:00 PM PDT on March 28, 2012.  Such communication ofcapabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination bythe Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis,based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.NASA is using the authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition provided by 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), because G4S Government Solutions Inc. (G4S) possesses unique expertisein meeting the security requirements of the Center, no alternate source could adequatelyprovide for the maintenance of the Centers comprehensive security program during thisextension period. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	    Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The installation Ombudsman is is Mr.Patrick C. Stoliker, (661) 276-2076 or patrick.c.stoliker@nasa.gov.

H4L interventions directly address key health system constraints in the following areas: local health systems governance; data for decision-making and evidence-based policy development; human resources; quality improvement systems; logistics systems; and, knowledge and behavior change. In addition to these cross-cutting areas of focus, H4L will work in 12-16 districts to improve access to and knowledge of maternal newborn, child health and family planning services. USAID's investment in these focus districts will complement USAID's other activities and will serve as a learning lab for nation-wide systems improvements.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to provide technical expertise in health systems strengthening including health information and policy development, quality improvement and health governance and logistics management, as well as the health service delivery areas of family planning, maternal, newborn and child health, nutrition, interpersonal communication and counseling skills, mass media and behavior change. The Contractor must work with the GON at all levels to engage in collaborative work planning for health across government ministries involved in local health governance. In addition, the Contractor will be required to purchase and distribute a limited amount of commodities and supplies related to delivery and newborn health services, tablet PCs and handheld devices for data collection and reporting, computer and office equipment, etc.</p>

<DESC>ARCHITECT-ENGINEER DESIGN SERVICES SOLICITATION GS-04P-12-BV-C-0012<br />THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE PROCUREMENT OPEN ONLY TO SMALL BUSINESSES.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.    <br />The GSA, Southeast Sunbelt Regions, Atlanta, GA is seeking Architect-Engineering (A/E) Services for the Design of New Courthouse/Federal Building in Mobile, Alabama. The estimated project construction cost range is $70 million to $80 million.  This construction cost range excludes the cost of the design effort in the proposed design contract. The effort will commence with pre-design studies and successive concept development and continue through to 100% construction documents and post-construction services. GSA anticipates using a construction manager-as-constructor (CMc) contract in conjunction with the A/E services contract for various quality assurance and cost management functions. The completed construction documents will provide the basis for the final negotiated price with the CMc for construction services.<br />Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, and reduced energy consumption. In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements, including the P100 [Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service]. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy goals, including standards mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 2005, and the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS).<br />The project is a new United States Courthouse in Mobile Alabama. The project is located in the Downtown Business Improvement District (BID) and the DeTonti Square Historic District of Mobile, Alabama and will be sited on approximately 3.28 acres of land between St. Anthony Street, St. Joseph Street, St Louis Street, and Joachim Street. This new project will continue the revitalization of the CBD (Central Business District) and be an anchor in the neighborhood. The project is approximately 229,000 Gross Square Feet (GSF) providing for a total of Seven (7) Courtrooms and eleven (11) Judges Chambers, Public Defender, Probation, US Attorney's Office, United States Marshals Service, US Senate, and General Services Administration offices and support spaces. The estimated construction cost at mid point in construction is in an estimated range of $70 - $80 Million Dollars based on Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 funding. The design should provide for the potential growth of one (1) courtroom and two (2) chambers through the relocation of the Probation/Pre-Trial Services, or by horizontal expansion of the building to meet the 30-year projection of space, which is potentially an additional 28,000 GSF excluding parking.  The design should make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the national urban and environmental policies of GSA.  The GSA plans to contract separately for a Construction Manager as Agent (CMa) and Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services during design. The CMa and CMc will support the Project during the design process with administration functions, Building Information Modeling (BIM) coordination, cost estimate reviews, and functional/constructability reviews. There will be formal partnering throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution through integrated project delivery that will be mutually beneficial for all parties involved. <br />SCOPE OF WORK<br />The scope of professional services will require a full range of architectural, engineering, and associated building design disciplines over the course of the design and construction phases, including but not limited to, interior design, landscape architecture, Building Information Modeling (BIM), cost estimating, and related consulting services,  The Project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); High Performance Green Building (HPGB)  technologies and strategies, LEED Gold NC Certification as defined by the U.S Green Building Council (USGBC); and customer agency requirements. The building shall be designed to meet the energy performance goals established by GSA and these performance goals will be verified through a total building commissioning process contracted for by GSA outside the scope of this contract. In addition, post construction contract services (PCCS) may be required to gather data in connection with LEED certification and meeting other performance goals.<br />SELECTION PROCESS<br />This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms and their associated Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.

<DESC><br />US Government Seeks Expression of Interest in Lakewood, CO #0CO2287
<p>Requirement:</p>
<p>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Lakewood, Colorado. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 142,112 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 128,885 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (ABOA). The lease term requirement is for ten (10) years, five (5) years firm. The Government is willing to consider seven (7) years firm, if the rate proposal proves to be economically advantageous to the Government. In order for a seven (7)-year firm term to be considered, both a seven (7)-year and a five (5)-year proposal must be provided to demonstrate that a longer firm term would be economically advantageous to the Government. The space must be available for occupancy by July 1, 2012.</p>
<p>The delineated area is as follows:<br />North: W. Hampden Avenue (I-285)<br />South: W. Quincy Ave.<br />East: S. Pierce Street<br />West: S. Wadsworth Blvd.</p>
<p>The Government will require twenty - seven (27) reserved parking spaces, including thirteen (13) handicapped parking spaces.</p>
<p>The requirement must be co-located with advertised requirement - #0CO2288.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

This is a Presolicitation Notice.  This Notice is being issued for planning and informational purposes only.  This notice is not a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice, nor will the Government accept proposals as a result of this Notice.  The plans and technical specifications for this requirement will only be available upon solicitation issuance.  <br><br>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The relocation of BCR will tie in to the recently completed roadway on the east in the vicinity of the west end of the Polaris Parking Lot and, on the west, will tie-in to the existing Bear Creek Road just before the intersection with Old Bear Creek Road.  The relocated BCR will be an urban-collector type road, compliant with Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) standards. The road will have 12-foot lanes (one in each direction) with a 10-foot-wide utility shoulder on the south side and an 18-foot-wide utility shoulder on the north.<br><br>A precast concrete beam bridge will be erected so BCR will pass over the haul road to prevent traffic into the Y-12 Complex from being interrupted or delayed by trucks on the haul road. The overpass will provide minimum vertical clearance of 20 feet, and the lower road will have a minimum width clearance of 45 feet for the full length.  <br><br>The BCR relocation scope consists of:<br>  Roadway construction, including overpass<br>  Tie-in to BCR eastern section<br>  Tie-in on the west just before the intersection of existing BCR and Old Bear Creek Road<br>  Steel casing for future duct bank crossing<br>  Drainage structures (including 3 retention ponds and storm drains)<br>  Safety appurtenances (i.e., guardrails, etc.)<br>  Signs and pavement marking<br>  Spur under the overpass with a base course of asphalt and temporary lane markings and signs<br>  Signalization, as determined by a study<br><br>Construction of 4,000 feet of a City of Oak Ridge 24-in diameter waterline and ~3,600 feet of a plant 16-in diameter waterline, are part of the road construction. The new reinstalled potable water lines will parallel the relocated Bear Creek Road.  The 24-in line will be installed in the 18-foot utility shoulder on the north side of the road, while the 16-in line, which will reduce to 12 inches, will be installed in the 10-foot shoulder on the south side.  Installation will include new valve vaults in addition to use of existing valve vaults. Installation also includes electrical service for motor-operated valves and flow event date messaging; duct banks will be installed for lines and cables, and an existing control panel will be relocated and a new control panel installed. Although these waterlines and associated power will be installed in this WBS element, tie-ins to the City of Oak Ridge and Y-12 potable water systems, as well as electrical tie-ins will occur in a following phase of work.<br><br>This description is not intended to be all encompassing and is subject to change. <br><br>NAICS CODE AND SBA SIZE STANDARD: The NAICS code for this project is 237310 with a size standard of $33,500,000. <br><br>TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: The solicitation will be unrestricted to obtain full and open competition. <br><br>SOLICITATION AND CONTRACT TYPE: It is anticipated that from the Request for Proposal Solicitation, the Government will use the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection Process to award one Firm-Fixed Price Construction Contract.  <br><br>DISCLOSURE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT: The disclosure of magnitude range is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.<br><br>SOLICITATION RELEASE DATE: The anticipated release date for this solicitation is on or about April 19, 2012.

<SUBJECT>84--Presolicitation Notice - Nape Protection Pad (NAPP) for Use With Marine Corps Helmets
<SOLNBR>M6785412R3026
<CONTACT>Lisandra Torres E-Mail Only
<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) intends to procure a Nape Protection Pad (NAPP) to be used with Marine Corps combat helmets.  The forthcoming solicitation will be issued on the basis of full and open competition and will include all instructions for offerors to follow when submitting a proposal.  The NAICS code will be 339999, with a size standard of 500.  This is a Presolicitation Notice only; no proposals are being requested at this time.  Information contained in this notice is subject to change.  

MARCORSYSCOM intends to issue a forthcoming solicitation for a total of 148,200 NAPPs; a base quantity of 113,000 to complete initial fielding and two option quantities of 17,600 each (35,200 total) in spares to allow for transition of the NAPP to Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support.
  The NAPP provides additional ballistic protection area of coverage to cover a Marines occipital region, an area not covered by any of the helmets in the USMC inventory.  This area contains many critical nervous system components such as the cerebellum, the brain stem, the occipital lobe, and the spinal cord.  Ground-based and vehicle-based explosives typically expel fragments up and away from the original position of the explosive.  This NAPP increases the ballistic protection area of coverage for Marines.

The NAPP must be compatible with all sizes of each combat helmet found in the Marine Corps inventory and shall not decrease a Marines head range of motion when wearing one of the combat helmets.
  The NAPP shall be compatible with the retention systems of each combat helmet, connecting directly and securely to each helmet retention system.  The NAPP shall not decrease helmet stability, lead to pressure points, or interfere with proper adjustment of the helmet suspension and retention system.

Offerors will be required to submit as part of their proposal submittal written technical and business volumes according to the specific instructions to be provided in the forthcoming solicitation, ten Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) consisting of five of each size (i.e. five size small/medium/large and five extra large/extra extra large) and thirty-two 15 by 15-inch square shoot pack samples of the proposed ballistic solution.

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to determine if there are additional sources capable of providing the required supplies and ancillary services. This is a Sources Sought Synopsis only. No solicitation is available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. The Government, through the Global Positioning Systems (GPS) Directorate at the Air Force Space &amp; Missile Systems Center (SMC/GP), is conducting market research to assist in determining the ability of industry to produce the Advanced Digital Antenna Production (ADAP) system.
<p>Description of Desired Capabilities: The Government contemplates awarding a follow-on sole source contract Raytheon Systems Limited, United Kingdom, to perform the following production, integration and test effort: (1) hardware procurement of ADAP Antenna Electronics; (2) hardware procurement of Controlled Reception Pattern Antennas; (3) hardware procurement of Ground Plan Enclosures; (4) Assembly, Integration and Test of Ground Plane Assemblies (with/without Fiber Optic Antenna Links); (5) repair of Antenna Electronics, Controlled Reception Pattern Antennas, and Ground Plane Assemblies; (6) Quick Reaction Support; (7) Technical Services; (8) transition to organic hardware support, including necessary rights in data; (9) transition to organic software support, including necessary rights in data. Antenna Electronics must meet the requirements of MIL-PRF-ADAP-AE-401, Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna must meet the requirements of MIL-PRF-ADAP-CRPA-402, and Ground Plane Assembly (with/without Fiber Optic Antenna Link) must meet the requirements of MIL-PRF-ADAP-GPA-403.</p>
<p>The Government does not own the "Production Build" drawing/specifications for the ADAP Antenna Electronics or Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna and there are no R&amp;D dollars available for this follow-on contract. Any changes to the existing specifications would result in a loss of interoperability with existing platform integrations and substantial costs associated with fielding multiple antenna systems (integration, training, spares, sustainment, etc.). The anticipated period of performance of the new contract is January 2013to 30 Sep 2017. It is also anticipated that program responsibility will be transferred to Warner Robins Air Logistics Center by or shortly after award of the new contract.</p>
<p>To accomplish program objectives, Respondents must be fully familiar with the ADAP design and interface requirements and able to begin production work upon award. The Respondent must operate facilities at and employ personnel cleared at the SECRET level and must comply with security requirements found in the GPS Security Classification Guide.</p>
<p>Submission Instructions: Information regarding capability must be submitted in writing. Proprietary information should be marked accordingly. Statements of Capability must be received by 20 April 2012 , 1200 hours, Pacific Standard Time. Submissions shall be unclassified and addressed to the contracting office personnel stated below. Responses shall be sent via e-mail and must be in electronic format (MS Word 2003 or newer, or PDF), and must conform to 8.5" x 11" page size, one-inch margins, type 12 font. Submittals must not exceed 10 pages, single-sided, in length. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. Responses from small business and small disadvantaged business firms with the capability and capacity to perform this requirement are highly encouraged.</p>
<p>The capability statement must provide the following information as a part of its cover sheet:<br />(1) Company name and address;<br />(2) Identify your organization's business type inclusive of any and all socio-economic status (e.g., 8(a) certified program participant, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran owned, HUB Zone or women-owned);<br />(3) Point of Contact,<br />(4) Phone/fax/e-mail;<br />(5) NAICS code(s); and,<br />(6) Information regarding your organization's capabilities.<br />Statements of capability shall include information relevant and specific to demonstrating the ability to meet ADAP production, integration, and test requirements described above, in additional to the following areas:<br />(1) Experience: A brief description of previous similar projects and experience demonstrating a high level of competence in required capabilities described above, including experience with antenna systems or similar technologies;<br />(2) Any other information that would demonstrate the ability to perform the required effort.<br />Respondents must demonstrate the ability to accomplish this effort, including experience relevant to the required capabilities and tasks described above. Respondents should clearly demonstrate the capability to perform production, integration, and test effort described. Documentation may include, but not be limited to, government and commercial contracts that the company performed (include government points of contact both technical and contractual), references, i.e. names, titles, telephone numbers and any other information serving to document the organization's capability, e.g., awards, commendations, etc.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential Respondents. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from Respondents when they prefer not to use established channels to communicate their concerns during any phase of the acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain Respondent issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this proposed acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the Program Director or the Contracting Officer but to advocate a Respondent concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the Respondent. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of SOCs for this proposed acquisition. The Ombudsman is Mr Jim Gill, (310) 653-1789. Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the POCs listed below. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 334220, with a size standard of 750 employees.</p>

Reference #1100747 when responding
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>Project Background</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Division of Product Quality Research (FDA/CDER/DPQR) requires a Near Infrared (NIR)/Raman Combination spectrometer with automatic switching between the two instruments, equipped with multiplex custom probes for in situ monitoring of protein therapeutic products during the lyophilization cycle. Due to the phase transition of the formulation from liquid to frozen, and finally a dry cake structure, it isi essential to monitor changes in the system to understand subtle changes that occur during the process. Near Infrared alone is not suitable for liquid systems, because water bands can interfere with interpretation, therefore Raman is needed as a complimentary tool to monitor the process during the initial phase from liquid to frozen solid. The two techniques will work to complement each other during the remainder of the cycle to monitor moisture content and other important chemical and physical changes.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking capability statements from companies that can provide a small business manufactured instrument with salient characteristics as listed.</p>
<p>.NIR+Raman Spectrometer<br />.NIR Wavelength 1.3 um (7000 cm-1) to 2.2 um (4500 cm-1), deep cooled detector to -55 degrees centigrade, without the use of liquid nitrogen<br />.Raman 785 nm excitation, 500 mW or greater - covers 300 cm-1 to 3200 cm-1, deep cooled detector to -55 degrees centigrade, without the use of liquid nitrogen<br />. An automated Switching mechanism from NIR to Raman mode</p>
<p>. Optical Switches: Capable of being at least 10 feet from the main instrument</p>
<p>.Raman - one optical switch controlling up to 4 fiber optic probes<br />.Near Infrared - one optical switch controlling up to 4 fiber optic probes</p>
<p>.Probes: Autoclavable Stainless steel construction, capable of fitting into a 20 mm diameter vial, less than 2 inches in length, with NIR and Raman coupled together for sampling of the same vial. Modification of existing rubber stoppers to fit the probes through to the sample without being crushed during vial stoppering. Modification of stainless steel port and tri-clamp to allow fiber optic lines into the lyophilizer. Probes must be able to withstand vacuum down to 35mTorr and pressurization up to 30 Psi, and temperatures between minus 45 degrees centigrade and 60 degrees centigrade.</p>
<p>.Raman - at least 4, up to 8 probes<br />.NIR - At least 4, up to 8 probes</p>
<p>. Data Acquisition and Analysis<br />Windows-based software package with flexible data acquisition, processing and output functionalities<br />Data station for instrument operation and data analysis and other necessary accessories</p>
<p>Optional:<br />. Additional Switches for 1 x 8 NIR and Raman (1 for each), within 1 year of acquisition<br />. Up to 6 additional custom NIR probes, within 1 year of acquisition<br />. Up to 6 additional custom Raman probes, within 1 year of acquisition<br />.

All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide <br />Services/supplies as below.</p>
<p>Mission of Cao lab at the Center for Molecular Medicine: The broad interest of the Cao group is to understand the metabolic and inflammatory basis of complex human diseases including but not limited to obesity, diabetes, fatty liver disease and cardiovascular disease. The long-term goal of the lab is to bridge the gaps between new developments in molecular biology and diseases of significant public health impact, and indentify novel therapeutic interventions against complex human diseases. <br />Researches in the past decade have established that dys-regulation of an intertwined network formed by metabolic and immune cells sits at the core of numerous pathological conditions particular obesity-induced metabolic and inflammatory disorders. The Cao group investigates the inflammatory basis of metabolic diseases and the defective metabolism as a general cause of complex human diseases. We use high-thought sequencing, proteomic screens and robust cell assays in combination with advanced bioinformatics analyses to identify critical metabolic regulators particularly microRNAs and epigenetic modifiers and study their pathophysiological significance in genetic and diseased animal models. Their direct implications in human diseases <br />Purpose: A Live Cell Imaging System is requested by the Dr. Haiming Cao's group. The Cao lab was recently established at Center for Molecular Medicine of NHLBI to study the pathological basis of metabolic diseases including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The laboratory needs a high quality microscope for imaging analyses of a wide range of samples including live and fixed cells and mouse and human tissue sections with high lipid content, and the requested system is the only full microscope system on the market that meets all our specific needs. <br />Government Functional Specification:</p>
<p>The Government requires a Live Cell Imaging System that has the following unique features that fit into the specific needs of our researches:</p>
<p>1. Fully integrated High Speed Non Laser based Optical Sectioning Unit</p>
<p>The Government studies a variety of metabolic cells such liver, muscle and fat cells. These cells, especially the fat cells, are relatively large and loaded with lipid droplets. An optical section is absolutely required when imaging these cells to sufficiently resolve the molecular details in our study. Although laser based scanning unit has been widely used for optical section, the strong laser light could cause lipid peroxidation and interfere with the molecular pathway we study. We need a microscope that is equipped with a High Speed Non Laser based Optical Sectioning Unit. Among the available non laser optical sectioning system, we prefer one that uses the aperture correlation technology with a full hardware and software integration. This technology uses a grid pattern that allows fifty percent of the total excitation light to reach the sample, providing more than sufficient transmission to use a white light source rather than lasers. Unlike other optical sectioning techniques, all photons emitted from the sample are collected; none are physically blocked from reaching the detector. In this unit, we would like that the excitation filters, dichroics, emission filters are mounted in a single block on the base plate and the excitation and emission filters are mounted into two 3-position filter wheels to allow a very quick switching (~100 milliseconds) between adjacent positions of the filter module. Furthermore, we need the system has the capability to acquire optically-sectioned and widefield data at the same time, which provides us with more information from the sample. The unit should provide two separate grid patterns which are optimized for the both the high NA lenses (&gt;1.0) and lower NA lenses (&lt;1.0) of the microscope system. This allows the lab to optimized optical sectioning of our samples with the full variety of lenses equipped with this imaging system. The system needs to be fully automated and optimized grid to be implemented for appropriate objectives with very simple automatic operation. Fast aperture correlation calibration must be possible with a single software click.</p>
<p><br />2. LED light illumination</p>
<p>Sometimes there is a need to perform long and repetitive imaging on the cells while they are alive and cultured in their optimal condition and this requires even milder illumination. LED modules produce very little heat with no UV over the visible range, which will minimize the perturbation of energy pathways we study. In addition, the very long life time of LED Modules &gt;20,000 hours (compared to 300 hour life time of a traditional fluorescence bulb) will translate into significant cost-saving over long term. The microscope we are requesting should be equipped with LED light illumination that is ideal for Gentle Live Cell Imaging. It should hold 4 unique LED modules at one time, usable either individually or simultaneously. All LED modules should be fully integrated into the hardware enabling the user to quickly and easily change modules in and out with the hardware autodetecting the new LED. It has very fast (&lt;1ms) switching time between LED modules. LED emission energy should be set individually for each LED. This allows us to specify the amount of energy each LED module can send to the sample.</p>
<p>3. Unique Microscope features critical to our research</p>
<p>40x objective with a 1.4 numerical aperture.</p>
<p>The scope should be equipped with a 40x objective with a 1.4 numerical aperture. This objective allows the maximum amount light to be collected during the imaging process at the highest possible resolution. Therefore excitation light intensity can be reduced to minimize sample photobleaching due to the increased emission light collection of the lens. This allows the lab to achieve ultra high resolution imaging even with very low expression in the samples. Often the low expressing cells are those which are most viable for study.</p>
<p>Transmitted Light Differential Interference Contrast</p>
<p>The Government also requires the scope equipped with advanced optics for Fluoresence and DIC that allows the lab to look at very small structures with pixel perfect overlay. The research looks at extremely fine processes and structures and the lab has found a DIC with an MgF2 plate built ensures homogeneity and precise pixel recognition between Fluorescence and DIC (ie no pixel shift between fluorescence and DIC images).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Focus Maintenance Module with LED grid projection</p>
<p>The scope should have an automatic focus maintenance module with far red LED grid projection to allow the region of interest to remain in focus for imaging over an extended period of time. It should also allow to navigate multiple locations of interest very quickly for imaging multiple live events in cells. Unlike devices which only project a point into the specimen plane, the grid projection allows very accurate focus to be maintained even when cover slips on our multi well dishes vary dramatically by looking at more a significantly larger area across the field. This is critical for the multi well live cell imaging experiments in which is needed to collect data for extended hours to obtain large statistical sampling for high precision results.</p>
<p><br />5. A robust, fully integrated and user-friendly Software</p>
<p>The software equipped with the scope should have features built for processing the very large image files often generated in our study. The metabolic organs we study such as liver and fat exhibit a great deal of variations in the different regions so we routinely cover very large area when imaging such tissue sections. A robust stitch capacity is required to piece together the individual images to generate a large contour and such imaging process demands often overload regular software and computer. The software should utilize a unique image file format that enables fast and efficient loading, handling, and processing of very large image files (several Gigabytes). It should allow simultaneous processing and viewing of data, including 3D while acquiring images in real time. Shading correction should be handled directly on the camera leading to highly precise and corrected stitching on the fly. As well, a 90o rotation of camera image should be available to ensure that all cameras on the system to have correct orientation for tiled images regardless of the camera position or rotation, including tiled images acquired using the aperture correlation optical sectioning device.</p>
<p>The software should give complete control over all components of the scope including filters, optical sectioning disk, shutter and allow to easily choose between a variety of imaging modes: capturing the raw data, a sectioned image, a widefield image, or a side-by-side view of the widefield and sectioned images. Capture of 3D data sets using the multichannel, timelapse, and Z-stack, mark and find locations with scanning stage, tiling, full range of measurement, and display of 3D data or extended Focus are all included with the software. A wizard that leads the user through the process of calibrating the unit is also going to be extremely helpful for our research.</p>
<p>In summary, the Government requires a Live Cell Imaging System that will meet all of the NHLBI laboratory's research needs and acquisition of such a microscope will significantly boost the research productivities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above and in the draft SOW.

<DESC>Introduction<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. <br /><br />Background<br />The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of AIDS (DAIDS), has a requirement for the provision of support services for the NIAID/DAIDS preclinical research portfolio.
<p>The development of HIV vaccines and other prevention strategies relies on the use of nonhuman primates in preclinical studies to advance the development of effective AIDS vaccine candidates and to advance development of effective topical microbicides and other prevention modalities or immune-based therapies.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The NIAID Simian Vaccine Evaluation Unit (SVEU) contracts shall provide nonhuman primate resources that primarily support preclinical evaluation of AIDS vaccines and prevention strategies. The SVEUs conduct studies in support of vaccines being developed by a wide range of investigators. These studies complement NIAID-supported basic vaccine research and vaccine evaluation studies funded through R01 (investigator-initiated research) grants, HIVRAD (HIV Vaccine Research and Design Program) grants, IPCAVD (Integrated Preclinical-Clinical AIDS Vaccine Development) grants, and NHP Consortium awards. The SVEUs also perform studies of candidate vaccines offered by companies or other researchers.</p>
<p>The SVEUs will use state-of-the-art techniques and technologies in evaluating promising AIDS prevention strategies in nonhuman primate models and will incorporate new and improved techniques and technologies into the studies conducted throughout the contract period.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement for a construction project at Stonington Harbor, Connecticut, to determine interest, availability and capability of HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Small Business concerns.  Work is expected to begin in October 2012 and will extend over a 3 to 4 month period.  The estimated construction cost is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.<br><br>The work of this project consists of repairing sections of the existing rubble mound east breakwater that was damaged during Tropical Storm Irene.  The east breakwater is located off-shore, approximately 1 mile to the south-east of Stonington Harbor in the Town of Stonington, CT.  Several sections of the rubble mound structure are damaged and require the placement of new 3 to 5 Ton stones to repair those areas where the structure crest height is significantly below the authorized elevation of 9 feet above Mean Low Water.  Approximately 2,000 to 2,500 Tons of stone will need to be brought to the off-shore structure, and used to repair the damaged sections of the breakwater.  It is expected that the placement of new stone will require the repositioning of adjacent existing stones to achieve the desired structure dimensions.  It is also expected that all work will be performed from floating plant, as the structure itself is not accessible from land and is not sufficient to support construction equipment.<br><br>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.) as well as demonstrating qualifications and experience with performing at least 5 projects involving construction/repair of similar massive stone structures such as seawalls, stone breakwaters, and jetties.  Responses should include experience of Foreman and Crane Operators working on massive stone structures.  Proof of bonding capability is required.  Responses are limited to twenty pages.  Responses are due April 11, 2012.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN:  Kimberly B. Pumyea.   Interested firms shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy.  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided.  This is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.  <br>

<a href="mailto:sarah.m.tierney@usace.army.mil">USACE HNC, Huntsville</a>
<DESC>Sources Sought: Global Logistics and Other Support Services to DoD (GLOSS DoD)<br><br>1. Contract Information: The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center in Huntsville (CEHNC), Alabama intends to solicit and award multiple, indefinite delivery/ indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for Base Camp set-up and operations, as well as other Logistical Support to DoD Units, located globally including within War Zones.  Current operations anticipated include electrical inspections and repair of U.S. occupied facilities on Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) supported bases and camps throughout the combat theater in Afghanistan.  The contracts are anticipated to be awarded in 2013 with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods, for a total ordering period of at least five years during which to compete for task orders.  The anticipated programmatic value of all task orders awarded under all of the ID/IQ contracts is $450M.<br><br>Interested sources should respond to the questions presented within this announcement in order to facilitate the Government's market research efforts.  The Government will analyze all responses and determine if the pool of qualified and interested small business firms is significant enough for a total set-aside competition restricted to small businesses or for a partial set-aside competition restricted to small businesses.  If the determination is made that there are not enough qualified and/or interested small business firms to perform this requirement, the Government may solicit the acquisition as an unrestricted full and open competition.  The Government does not intend to rank submittals or provide any reply to interested firms. <br><br>2. Project Information: The primary focus of this effort is for low voltage electrical power system inspections of all U.S. occupied facilities and the ability to conduct immediate corrective actions for imminent life, health, and safety (LHS) hazards identified during the inspections.  An additional requirement provides Fire Safety Program and Fire Brigade Training support to US Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A).  This training supports fire safety concepts, fire protection and alarm systems, building codes and National Fire Codes and Standards.  This support is critical due to the temporary nature of most of the facilities being utilized and the potential for catastrophic fires that could happen if facilities caught fire.  The fire safety training also serves to ensure that potential electrical risks are reduced, which would decrease LHS hazards identified during the electrical inspections.  The requirement will also include generator inspections and power optimization recommendations for systems providing low voltage electrical power to inspected facilities.  These inspections, immediate corrective actions and documentation of other needed repairs support the congressionally mandated safety inspection program delineated in Section 807, "Policy and Requirements to Ensure the Safety of Facilities, Infrastructure, and Equipment for Military Operations" of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2010 directs the Department of Defense (DOD) to conduct safety inspections of all facilities intended for use by US DOD personnel in present or future military operations.  A wide range of other logistical support to DoD Units is anticipated.<br><br>3. Submission Requirements: This sources sought announcement is open for responses from both small and large businesses. The Government is seeking to identify qualified sources either singularly or as part of an assembled team under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 238210, Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors.<br><br>Interested firms should submit a document describing relevant demonstrated experience and qualifications via email to sarah.m.tierney@usace.army.mil and tonju.l.butler@usace.army.mil no later than 10 April 2012 in the following format: Submissions should not exceed ten- 8.5 inches x 11 inches pages (five pages if printed two-sided). The submission should address all questions in the sources sought questionnaire below and your firm's ability to perform the requirement. <br><br>This synopsis is for market research purposes only and is not a request for proposal (RFP) nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice. <br><br>No hard copy of facsimile submissions will be accepted.  Cover letters and extraneous materials (brochures, etc) will not be considered.  Questions concerning submissions should be directed to Ms. Sarah Tierney, Contract Specialist at Sarah.M.Tierney@usace.army.mil or Ms. Tonju Butler, Contracting Officer at Tonju.L.Butler@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>U.S. Army Contracting Command-Redstone Arsenal, AATD Contracting Division (AATD Contracting), Fort Eustis, Virginia, proposes to acquire on an other than full and open competition basis a program entitled, 'Advanced Helicopter Electromagnetics (AHE) Research'.  This research includes analysis and development of computational tools for helicopter applications, development and improvements to Finite-Difference Time-Domain, Finite Element, Method of Moments, diffraction methods and hybrid techniques to predict the electromagnetic (EM) performance characteristics of antennas and sensors on complex composite material vehicles/airframes. In addition, research results are used to identify and develop new antenna technologies to extend and improve EM capabilities of rotorcraft and other mobile platforms. It is anticipated that a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract with a base year and 4 option years will be awarded.  A noncompetitive acquisition to Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85287-0103 is intended pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1).  Arizona State is deemed to be the only known source of computational EM research dedicated to military rotorcraft applications.  No other known organization or university has compiled the extensive research data in the areas such as computational modeling of complex metallic and non-metallic helicopter structures, rotor blade modulation analysis, helicopter antenna performance, antenna coupling, lighting effects, EM wave penetration analysis for electromagnetic interference (EMI) and EM effects on rotorcraft.  In addition no other known organization has the unique scale model helicopters, computational models, helicopter geometries, and EM measurement facilities required for testing, evaluation, and verification of the research results.  The costs that would be duplicated for another organization to acquire similar capabilities are substantial.  <br>Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement and submit a proposal. All responsible sources that submit an offer will be considered.<br> A formal solicitation for this program will not be issued.  The Government will consider all submissions received within forty-six days after date of publications of this synopsis solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Proposals should be submitted no later than May 07, 2012 at 2:00 p.m. EDT and shall be submitted electronically via the Army SAFE Site (https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/SAFE/) to patricia.a.hagginbothom.civ@mail.mil and elizabeth.a.jackson.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>Library of Congress<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />PURSUANT TO FAR 15.201(e)
<p>The Library of Congress and the National Library of Medicine seek to maximize their ability to ingest electronic serial content by limiting the variety of incoming content to a small number of widely-adopted digital formats. This will help to minimize customized processing on receipt, to facilitate digital preservation, and to enable efficient ingest into the libraries respective digital preservation, and researcher-access systems. To these ends, we are interested in gathering information from organizations that currently: receive electronic serial content from publishers or other sources; have established procedures for performing additional handling, editing, and verification functions; convert (normalize) that content into one or more standardized formats, preferably a structured XML container such as the Journal Archiving Tag Suite (JATS); and parse and/or extract any accompanying metadata. In addition, the national libraries are looking to streamline processing of incoming digital content for their collections, and are interested in gathering information from organizations that can: provide to the libraries the normalized content and metadata in industry-standard packaging structures; provide the content via secure transfer methods; and provide the content on a mutually-agreeable schedule. The libraries would be interested in significant, partial solutions as well. <br /><br />This announcement is a request for INFORMATION ONLY and does not obligate the Library of Congress or the National Library of Medicine in any way. This is not a request for proposal and the Library of Congress will not pay for any information submitted or for any expenses associated with providing information. Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary. Material submitted will be deemed proprietary to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations if so marked by the respondent</p>
<p>Disclaimer<br />This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not respondents to a contract solicitation and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to go Sol Source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 for the following items and services:
Steelhead and Chinook Marking and Tagging
Vendor:Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission205 SE Spokane Street, Suite 100Portland, Oregon  97202

The Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) marks and tags more than eight million Chinook salmon and steelhead annually at fish hatcheries in California=BFs Central Valley Chinook.  Marking and tagging are accomplished using sophisticated state-of-the-art patented AutoFish tagging systems, which enable processing of larger numbers of fish and with improved precision as compared to the traditional method of conducting the task manually.  PSMFC personnel have specialized technical expertise in the operation of the state-of-the-art AutoFish tagging systems, and no other contractor can provide personnel with the immediate unique technical expertise to operate the Autofish tagging systems.  The Autofish tagging systems available for use in California are shared among all of the State and Federally operated hatcheries in the Central Valley, and are the property of the California Department of Fish and Game.  Because of the unique expertise required to operate the Autofish tagging systems, the California Department of Fish and game require that PSMFC staff be the only contractor permitted to operate the Autofish systems.  Marking/tagging fish using manual techniques is the only alternative to marking/tagging with the automated system, and would result in a significant increase in program cost and decreased precision.  Currently, no steps are being pursued to enable full and open competition for subsequent contracts for fish marking and tagging services at the Service=BFs Coleman and Livingston Stone National Fish Hatchery Complex because of the special circumstances associated with the ownership and operation of the Autofish tagging systems facility.
The Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) is an interstate Compact established by Congress in 1947 (Public Law 232, 80th Congress, 61 Stat. 419), and adopted by the State of California (Chapter 1447, 1974).  The purposes of the Compact are to promote the better utilization of fisheries, marine, shell and anadromous, and to develop a joint program of protection and prevention of physical waste of such fisheries in all of those areas of the Pacific Ocean and adjacent waters over which the compacting States jointly or separately now have or may have jurisdiction.  PSMFC is governed by one or more representatives from each state, as determined by state statutes, and is supported by annual funds made available by the member states.
One of PSMFC=BFs objectives under the Compact is to facilitate research and management projects relating to interstate fisheries.  This includes providing administrative, fiscal and field coordination and support for interstate and State/Federal research and management projects.  PSMFC has provided this service to the State of California both in the form of administering federal funds to the State of California and state and local funds from the State of California.

Contact Bryant Soule, Contract Specialist (315-330-4723 or bryant.soule@rl.af.mil), no later than 3:00 PM (EST) on FRIDAY 30 MARCH 2012 to ensure site access. All attending parties must be identified so security forms and gate clearances can be processed.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (FEB 2012), applies to this acquisition. Addenda to the following paragraphs of 52.212-1 are:</p>
<p>(b) Written proposals are due by 3:00 PM (EST) on 19 April 2012. Submit to: AFRL/RIKO, Attn: Bryant Soule, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514 or by facsimile to: 315-330-2555 or by email to bryant.soule@rl.af.mil.</p>
<p>(b)(10) The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offerors' performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this RFP. Offerors shall submit past performance information to include recent and relevant contracts which demonstrate the ability of the offeror to perform the proposed effort. Please provide past performance information for no more than five (5) relevant contracts performed for Government agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years. To the maximum extent practicable, identify contracts for properties which are not owned or operated by your firm or by key personnel, including intended subcontractors, of your firm. <br />Referenced past performance information should include contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers, and a narrative explaining the contract's relevancy to the solicitation.</p>
<p>To be considered RELEVANT, performance must meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>&bull; Contract efforts that required mowing, edging, trimming, pruning, policing, and leaf removal of a lawn area at least 10 acres in size.</p>
<p>(k) Central Contractor Registration. Offerors must be registered in the CCR database to receive a contract award. If the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database within four (4) days after receiving notification from the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered offeror. Information may be obtained at http://www.ccr.gov or 888-227-2423.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) applies. In addition to the information in paragraph (a), the following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) PRICE and (ii) PAST PERFORMANCE. After considering all past performance data gathered by the Government for this solicitation, an offeror's past performance will be assigned a confidence rating based on the list below:</p>
<p>-Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-Limited Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>Past performance regarding predecessor companies, personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors will not be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history, or a performance record that is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned, shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance assessment, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p><br />The representations and certifications in the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2012) and Alternate I (APR 2011) must be completed electronically on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective January 23, 2012 electronically. IMPORTANT:  CURRENT SCHEDULE 084 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.


SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:  Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that effective January 1, 2005, all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must have their Offeror Representations and Certifications updated in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website.  The ORCA website can be accessed http://www.bpn.orga.gov.  

Please note that any offer submitted after February 22, 2012 MUST be submitted on the Solicitation dated January 23, 2012 (Refresh #18) and must be submitted through the eOffer system.  Offers received after February 22, 2012 that are submitted on prior versions will not be accepted.  

Effective December 10, 2010, firearm lubricants added by modification to current contracts or awarded under new contracts for Special Item Number  (SIN) 426-4G, Firearms Storage, Securing and Cleaning Equipment; Unloading Stations; Bullet Recovery Systems and Gun Racks must meet the Bio-preferred standard.  Executive Order 13514 (http://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13514/]) requires that 95% of all new contract actions are designated for green products and/or services through certification guidelines established by governmental agencies.  In order to begin implementation of that order, GSA has designated that one SIN on Schedule 84 will require green certification.  For SIN 426-4G (Attachment 5), firearm lubricants must be certified as Biopreferred by obtaining certification from the U. S. Department of Agriculture at www.biopreferred.gov.  The offeror must make an affirmative statement that the products offered are compliant with the applicable standard and the products are listed on the USDA website.   If not listed, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to ask for copies of the certification.

This refresh includes the addition of five (5) new SINs for Ancillary Supplies and/or Services: 260-1000, 465-1000, 633-1000, 246-1000, and 426-1000. These SINs may only be offered in conjunction with the offer of a corresponding product SIN. 

Effective with this refresh (18), offers longer accepted under SIN 246-50; services previously covered under SIN 246-50 are now covered under new SIN 246-1000.

Effective with this refresh (18), offers longer accepted under SIN 260-98; services previously covered under SIN 260-98 are now covered under new SIN 260-1000.

<DESC>The FDA has a requirement for six (6) Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograph systems. FDA drug groups across the country have always been crippled by slow analysis time due to the complexity of drug work caused by the many different products and different analyses for each product that can potentially be needed. Each sample requires different standards, different reagents, and different methodology. On top of all these factors to consider with a drug sample, then a drug analyst must contend with older USP methodologies that are extremely time-consuming. UPLC technology will shorten the analysis portion for many of the USP analyses making it easier to move to a high throughput lab environment. The instrumentation will be distributed to field office labs to meet the Agency's goal of moving to a high throughput laboratory. UPLC would decrease analysis time for many drug analyses by at least half, allowing the analysts to increase production and reduce analytical time. Please see the attached solicitation.

PPIRS is an electronic repository of performance information collected by all the major federal performance reporting systems.  Logging onto PPIRS will require the following:  All firms must have purchased and installed a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate.  If you do not have this certificate, you cannot access your information.  Additional information about the PKI certificate is posted in red at the top, center portion, of the http://www.ppirs.gov web page.  You will also need your DUNS number and Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) to log onto PPIRS.  The MPIN number was selected by whoever registered your firm in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov .  If you do not know your MPIN number, you will need to contact the CCR help desk by emailing them from the email link on the http://www.ccr.gov/help.asp web page.  Please be aware that they will only release the MPIN number to the person who originally registered your firm.<br><br>There are two other ways to obtain a copy of ACASS evaluations as follows: (1) Contact your government point of contact for the project you mentioned, and ask them if they can send you a copy, or (2) Apply for "Contractor Corporate Senior Management Representative" access on the following ACASS web page:  http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. This type of access is issued to only one person within the firm, typically a member of senior management.  In addition to access to your completed ACASS performance evaluations, you will also be able to view status of evaluations which have not yet been completed.  Following receipt of your faxed application request, you will be emailed a logon and access instructions.  This type of access will only let you see ACASS information, so it is not as complete as PPIRS access which allows access to evaluations prepared by non-DOD federal agencies, as well as the DOD agencies which use ACASS.  Be aware that you will also need to have a PKI certificate to access the ACASS system.  This is a DOD requirement.<br><br>c.	Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ)<br><br>The Past Performance Questionnaire is provided for the offeror (available as a download with this announcement - see the "Packages" tab) or its team members to submit to the client.  The Past Performance Questionnaire should be completed by an owner or owner's representative not affiliated with your firm.  Ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact.<br><br>Completed Past Performance Questionnaires should be submitted with your proposal. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before proposal closing date, the offeror should complete and submit with the proposal the first page of the PPQ, which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s).  Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their proposal PPQs previously submitted for other RFPs; however, they may be submitted in full text if they exist (i.e. offerors are not required to re-obtain PPQs for the same project).  PPQs already in the possession of Offerors may be on other/previous versions of PPQs.  New PPQs must only be obtained on the form available for download with this announcement and submitted for projects for which the Offeror does not already have a completed PPQ, in one version or another (and, again, PPQs are only required if ACASS or other governmental performance appraisal sheets are not available for submission with the Offer - see a. above).<br><br>d.	Government Utilization of Alternate Information Sources for Past Performance<br><br>The Government will assess the past performance on projects submitted and reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews with points of contact identified in the proposal or to review personal knowledge.  In addition, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance of the Offeror on the submitted projects and any other previous work. Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, joint venture, teaming arrangement, or parent company/subsidiary/affiliate) identified in the offeror's proposal, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), and any other known sources not provided by the offeror.<br><br>While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror.<br><br>(13)	Volume of Department of Defense (DOD) contract awards the Contractor has received and has active actions on in the last twelve (12) months.<br><br>Announcement Section C - Ratings and Definitions<br><br>i.	The following ratings will be used to evaluate documentation submitted by offerors (note that documentation submitted for evaluation in response to this announcement may be referred to throughout this announcement as an "offer", "proposal", or "response" - all of which are representative of the SF330 information being requested by this announcement):<br><br>	Exceptional - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in the majority of the aspects of the particular factor. Strengths are present indicating maximum benefit to the government and no weaknesses, significant weaknesses or deficiencies are indicated.<br><br>	Above Average - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in many aspects of the particular factor.  Strengths are present indicating significant benefit to the government.  The proposal may have weaknesses that have no impact on the proposal as a whole and do not require correction.  <br><br>	Average - The offer matches the scope of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be strengths but they may not aggregate into an advantage indicating additional benefit to the Government, or they may be offset by weaknesses.  Any weaknesses noted have only a minor impact on the proposal and are easily correctable.  <br><br>	Marginal - The offer matches some, but not all, of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be limited or individual strengths, but they do not aggregate into an advantage and are offset by weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies.  Weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies are correctable without major revision to the proposal.  The Government may still receive benefit from the offer submitted.<br><br>	Unacceptable - The offer fails to meet a majority of announcement requirements or has omitted critical information required to evaluate the factor.  There are no strengths.  The offer contains multiple weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies, which are all correctable only with major revision to the proposal.  A proposal that receives a final rating of "Unacceptable" for any factor may not be considered for award.<br><br>	Neutral - In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably on past performance.<br><br>ii.	Definitions:<br><br>Strength - Any aspect of a proposal that, when judged against a stated evaluation factor, enhances the merit of the proposal or increases the probability of successful performance of the contract.<br><br>Weakness - A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  A "significant weakness" in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.<br><br>Deficiency - A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.<br><br>Announcement Section D - Submission Instructions, Selection Process and Additional Information<br><br>i.	Eligible interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit ONE (1) ORIGINAL AND TWO (2) COPIES, each containing Parts I and II of the SF330 information for the prime firm and all subcontractors/subconsultants (as necessary), as directed with respect to time, date, place of receiving proposals and acceptable methods of delivery identified in item iii. of this Announcement Section D.  Part I, Part II and Sections of the submitted SF330 information (reference SF330 instructions for definitions of Part I, Part II and Sections) of each copy shall be separated by tabs (dividers) and clearly marked.  Part I, Section H shall include all information requested per this announcement that does not reasonably fit, in the offeror's best estimation, into any other Sections of SF330 Part I or Part II.<br><br>FOR THE PRIME OFFEROR, PROVIDE THE FIRM'S DUNS NUMBER AND CAGE CODE IN SF330, PART I, BLOCK B, BOX 5.  FOR SUBCONTRACTORS/SUBCONSULTANTS, PROVIDE THESE FIRMS' DUNS NUMBERS AND CAGE CODES IN SF330, PART I, BLOCK C, BOX 9.<br><br>All proposers, including joint-ventures, must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR)  at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/ and have completed their Online Representations and Certification Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov/.<br><br>All proposals submitted will become, upon receipt, the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.  After evaluation of proposals, the original will be retained for the official contract file.  Extra copies of the awardee's proposal may be provided to other offices for carrying out contract administration functions.  Any extra copies of proposals deemed unnecessary by the government will be destroyed.<br><br>ii.	Upon completion of evaluation of the SF330s received, a short list of most qualified firms will be determined.  Until selection is completed, there will be no notification of any type to proposing firms.  Once the short list is approved by the Source Selection Authority, those firms that did not make the short list will be promptly notified.  There will be up to three (3) contracts awarded as a result of negotiations.  Each contract will have a period of performance (i.e. ordering period) of five (5) years from the date of basic IDIQ contract award and $5 million in capacity. <br><br>iii.	Completed SF 330 information must reach the Contracting Division Offices not later than 2:00 p.m. (Central/local time) on Tuesday, 24-Apr-2012.  All questions concerning this announcement should be addressed to Edward Jackson, Contract Specialist, by email at edward.j.jackson@usace.army.mil.<br><br>The packaging that contains the response materials must be SEALED and MARKED:<br><br>"Response to Announcement No. W9128F-12-R-0027; to be opened by Contraction Division personnel ONLY."

On the date specified and for thirty (30) minutes prior to the specified time, a Contracting representative will be in the lobby of the building at the above address to receive offers. Containers (e.g. envelopes, packages, boxes) will be screened for security purposes.  Hand-carried means the individual must be able to carry on their person.  If due to size or volume, packages or boxes need to be wheeled in on a cart or dolly, you will be required to go to the dock area located on the northeast side of the facility. After inspection and screening, you will be allowed in the building after presenting valid photo identification.  At the offer due date/time specified above, it will be announced that receipt of proposals is closed. Official time will be established by a clock designated by the Contracting representative receiving hand-carried proposals, to be located in the area of proposals being received.  Recent terrorist threats have resulted in more time-consuming sign-in and escort procedures and may impact the timely delivery of offers.  This instruction shall also apply to those proposals delivered through a delivery or parcel service.  NOTE:  No parking on the street in front of the facility entrances will be allowed.  Passenger vehicles will need to locate parking meters or parking garages before delivering proposals.  Delivery trucks must go to the dock.  The vehicle will be inspected and packages screened at the dock.  After inspection and screening, the delivery person will be allowed into the building.<br><br>Requests for in-person visits for the purpose of discussing this announcement will not be scheduled.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St., SW JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202-475-3904</p>

<p>(b) Written proposals are due by 3:00 PM (EST) on 19 April 2012. Submit to: AFRL/RIKO, Attn: Bryant Soule, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514 or by facsimile to: 315-330-2555 or by email to bryant.soule@rl.af.mil.</p>
<p>(b)(10) The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offerors' performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this RFP. Offerors shall submit past performance information to include recent and relevant contracts which demonstrate the ability of the offeror to perform the proposed effort. Please provide past performance information for no more than five (5) relevant contracts performed for Government agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years. To the maximum extent practicable, identify contracts for properties which are not owned or operated by your firm or by key personnel, including intended subcontractors, of your firm. <br />Referenced past performance information should include contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers, and a narrative explaining the contract's relevancy to the solicitation.</p>
<p>To be considered RELEVANT, performance must meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>&bull; Contract efforts that required mowing, edging, trimming, pruning, policing, and leaf removal of a lawn area at least 10 acres in size.</p>
<p>(k) Central Contractor Registration. Offerors must be registered in the CCR database to receive a contract award. If the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database within four (4) days after receiving notification from the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered offeror. Information may be obtained at http://www.ccr.gov or 888-227-2423.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) applies. In addition to the information in paragraph (a), the following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) PRICE and (ii) PAST PERFORMANCE. After considering all past performance data gathered by the Government for this solicitation, an offeror's past performance will be assigned a confidence rating based on the list below:</p>
<p>-Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-Limited Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>Past performance regarding predecessor companies, personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors will not be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history, or a performance record that is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned, shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance assessment, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p><br />The representations and certifications in the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2012) and Alternate I (APR 2011) must be completed electronically on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website at http://orca.bpn.gov.

As used in this clause?(1) ?Contract financing payment? and ?invoice payment? have the meanings given in section 32.001 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.(2) ?Electronic form? means any automated system that transmits information electronically from the initiating system to all affected systems. Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are not acceptable electronic forms for submission of payment requests. However, scanned documents are acceptable when they are part of a submission of a payment request made using Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) or another electronic form authorized by the Contracting Officer.(3) ?Payment request? means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the Contractor under this contract.(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF, in one of the following electronic formats that WAWF accepts: Electronic Data Interchange, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or World Wide Web input. Information regarding WAWF is available on the Internet at https://wawf.eb.mil/.(c) The Contractor may submit a payment request and receiving report using other than WAWF only when?(1) The Contracting Officer authorizes use of another electronic form. With such an authorization, the Contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree to a plan, which shall include a timeline, specifying when the Contractor will transfer to WAWF;(2) DoD is unable to receive a payment request or provide acceptance in electronic form;(3) The Contracting Officer administering the contract for payment has determined, in writing, that electronic submission would be unduly burdensome to the Contractor.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted.
<p>Technical questions and responses are hereby provided:</p>
<p>QUESTION #1: Can you provide more information regarding specification #8: Must include all software required to operate DAS (except LabVIEW)?</p>
<p>RESPONSE #1: This would include software required to operate the DAS, such as an operating system for the controller, a utility program to configure the DAS, etc. It does not include the LabVIEW because NIST has an agreement for licensing of the LabVIEW Full Development System (FDS).</p>
<p>QUESTION #2: Does the DAS include the LabVIEW software development? If so, what are the specifications for the software (graphs, manual control, logging, etc.)?</p>
<p>RESPONSE #2: No. The DAS must only able to run a LabVIEW program, which will be developed by NIST scientists.</p>

Solicitation Number: SOL-CI-12-00036  Notice Type: Combined Synopsis/Solicitation
Site Gas Regulators Synopsis:  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Testing and Advanced Technology Division (TATD), and the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) has a requirement for two stage gas regulators, with the specifications listed below.
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Refer to SOL-CI-12-00036 when responding to this request. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55. This acquisition is a total set-a-side for small business. The NAICS code is 325120, the size standard is 1,000 Employees.
Background:  The TATD (Testing and Advanced Technology Division) is modifying gas supply system in the new CTF (Cold test facility) and SC03 vehicle testing areas. To maintain consistent gas flows to these and any future sites connected to this cylinder supply location, TATD will institute a dual stage gas delivery system from the new manifold being installed in these testing locations. A dual stage gas regulator will be added inline to each gas being delivered to the two analyzer benches located in the CTF and SC03 test area. This will allow the initial gas cylinder regulator to flow at a higher pressure and secondary site regulators will correct for gas pressure fluctuation at each analyzer location and maintain a consistent gas source enabling improved gas sample readings for testing and calibration.  Specifications: The contractor shall furnish two stage gas regulators in standard brass chrome plated versions (Quantity 80) and  corrosive stainless steel versions (Quantity 20). The regulator size is critical due to the limited space available at each gas supply rack. The gas valve rack to which these regulators will be connected is only 12 inches deep and 33 inches wide.  Due to the varying gasses needed and their locations on the supplied forty gas lines the regulators size must not exceed 1-3/4" body width.  Both stages will be fitted with a gauge. First stage will be sized 0 to 500psi second stage will be sized 0-60 psi. Gauges will be constructed of appropriate material for their use. Total depth of regulator body with attached gauges must not exceed 3" over all height of regulator assembly must not exceed 6". Inlet and outlet ports will be ?" NPT thread. Due to its proximity to other regulators in the valve rack the inlet must port from the top. The outlet must port f rom the rear of the regulator. The regulator must be capable of inlet pressures up to 3000psi in case of cylinder regulator failure. The regulator output flow must be at least 10 SLPM at 25psi at an inlet pressure of 250 psi.   Regulators shall be off the shelf commercially available assembled from standard designed parts with no special machined components.  
Payment:  Payment will be made upon acceptance and submission of a properly prepared invoice from the Contractor. The Purchase Order Number assigned to this contract must appear on all invoices.  The Purchase Order Number is noted in Block #3 of Optional Form 347, "Order for Supplies or Services" to be sent to the Contractor at the time of award.
All supplies shall be provided to the EPA NVFEL located at 2565 Plymouth Rd., Ann Arbor, MI 48105 within 56 days after receipt of award. The F.O.B. point shall be destination. The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this to this acquisition.

<DESC>This specification outlines the minimum requirements necessary to meet ARM's science goals with the Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (SACR) and the associated infrastructure to install the SACR at each of the identified ACRF sites. The goal of achieving three dimensional coverage while maintaining adequate radar sensitivity involve tradeoffs that require flexibility in the operational parameters of the radar and its integral scanner.

<p>The SACR will be set up to operate in various modes by a local or remote operator. From a data flow perspective; the SACR radars shall be considered separate radars, each having its own separate data files. The SACR shall record data in hourly files that are pulled via ftp by the ACRF site data system.</p>
<p>The SACRs shall be self-sufficient requiring only electrical power and a network connection. The shelter shall be based on an 8' x 8' x 20' sea container (aka ISO shipping container).<br /><br />3/21/2012--Modifying solicitation with Amendment 1.&nbsp; Adding Attachments 7-9.</p>

<DESC>Regarding all RFP documents, AF-IPPS will be transitioning from HERBB to FedBizOps.&nbsp; This is as a result of the HERBB system's decommissioning on May 1, 2012.&nbsp; At that time, the HERBB webpage as well as all data associated with it, will no longer be accessbile.&nbsp; During the time leading up to HERBB's shutdown, all relevant postings and data will be transferred over to FedBzOps&nbsp;(at solicitation number&nbsp;at FA8721-11-R-01)&nbsp;.&nbsp; We encourage that you start looking for updates to AF-IPPS on FedBizOps as we will begin posting updates solely there immediately.&nbsp; Thank you. <br /><br /><br />The Government would like to remind potential offerors during the pre-proposal stage of the AF-IPPS program to consider whether they might have any significant potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI). ESC first established a very comprehensive process to address OCI issues in 2004 thanks to significant input from our industry partners. The present 2008 policy is described at http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/OCI-IDB2008.ppt. This policy requires a thorough analysis of potential OCI issues in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate OCI. Early involvement is a key element of the ESC OCI process, so please evaluate your potential OCI issues during the pre-proposal stage of the acquisition process.

<p>SYNOPSIS<br />BIRD AIRCRAFT STRIKE HAZARD (BASH) &amp; WILDLIFE CONTROL SERVICES<br />SOLICITATION FA4621-11-R-0004</p>
<p>Synopsis Description Section:</p>
<p>The 22d Contracting Squadron (22 CONS) of the 22d Air Refueling Wing announces the projected solicitation for Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) &amp; Wildlife Control Services at McConnell AFB, Kansas 67221.</p>
<p>The 22d Contracting Squadron (AMC), McConnell Air Force Base (AFB), Kansas, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a 100% set-aside to Small Business (SB) concerns on or about 12 September 2011 for the acquisition of BASH &amp; Wildlife Control services to be performed at McConnell AFB KS. All responsible SB concerns may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Responses to the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be evaluated using Price-Performance Trade-Off (PPTO) evaluation factors with performance being significantly more important than price. The Government intends to issue an award to a single SB concern under a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Requirements Type contract on or about 12 November 2011. Services will be procured pursuant to the regulatory direction of FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The expected award shall consist of one base period of performance (1 year, 1 February 2012 through 31 January 2013) and may include up to four optional periods of performance (each 1 year in duration, following the Federal Fiscal Year Calendar and running consecutively from the expiration of the base period of performance). There is no guarantee that any optional periods of performance may be exercised.</p>
<p>The primary emphasis of this program is to prevent bird airstrike hazards. However, the contractor shall provide a comprehensive wildlife control program to mitigate the risk of wildlife at McConnell AFB, KS. Wildlife encountered includes, but is not limited to: birds, foxes, dogs, skunks, snakes, turtles, coyotes, and deer. The program may include, but is not limited to, the use of trained birds of prey, dogs, pyrotechnics, harassment, trapping, relocation, airfield patrol, and perimeter fence monitoring and as set forth in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) for said services. The successful contractor shall provide all personnel, management, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation and all other items necessary (excluding Government Furnished Property). The contractor shall comply with all federal, state, and local regulations in performance of this contract. The NAICS code for this requirement is 561710, Exterminating and Pest Control Service. The Small Business Size Standard is $7,000,000.</p>
<p>The closing date and time for submission of offers shall be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation package, including the Standard Form 1449 and continuation pages, the Performance Work Statement, the Department of Labor Wage Determination and the Past and Present Performance Questionnaire, shall be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Requests for copies of the solicitation package, or any cumulative parts thereof, by any other means shall not be honored. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for the release of the solicitation package, which should be on or about 12 September 2011, for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package and for downloading their own copy of each associative amendment, if any.</p>
<p>All firms wishing to submit a proposal subsequent to the solicitation described herein MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as well as the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database or risk their otherwise-timely proposal being considered non-responsive regardless of its completeness, timeliness or other salient considerations. Information on CCR and ORCA registrations can be obtained at their respective web sites: http://www.ccr.gov and http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>No response to this announcement is required. The government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement. The solicitation subsequent to this announcement may be cancelled. After solicitation and prior to award the possibility exists to reject all offers when cancellation is clearly in the public interest. This announcement does not obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.</p>
<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101, the following applies:</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: Michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />*****</p>

The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is for market research purposes to gain knowledge of potentially interested and qualified sources.

There is no solicitation available at this time. Information should focus on the capability to provide the technical support services defined below. Standard company brochures are not desired.<br />The United States Air Force seeks to procure contractor support to provide IT services to support approximately 200 users. The software used by the United States Air Force is significantly more sophisticated than typical office automation: including specialized operations research models, mathematical optimization, and other general tools associated with operations research. The computational heart of the organization is located in a SCIF with specialized analytic architectures that combine UNIX (Solaris, IRIX, and/or LINUX) with Windows in stand-alone networks. These architectures are selectively combined and modified in some instances to run on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) with AF Enterprise office automation applications.

To evaluate the potential number of vendors capable of adequately performing under the United States Air Force PWS, a thorough review of capability statements will be conducted. Interested parties who believe they have the ability to provide the required services are invited to supply a capabilities statement of no more than twenty (20) pages. Capability statements must include: <br />1. Complete Business Name, including DUNS Number <br />2. Contact Information (Respondent's name and title, address, telephone, facsimile, e-mail) <br />3. Business Size and Classification (small, small-disadvantaged, SBA Certified 8(a), HUBZone, service-disabled, veteran-owned etc). <br />Capability statements must address technical competencies and management/personnel experience relative to the key task areas detailed in the draft PWS.<br />The Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed-price contract with a one-year base period and two one-year option periods. The Government intends to issue the solicitation in May 2012 after a pre-solicitation notice is published as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.2.

AMENDMENT A001 ISSUED 3/21/12 TO EXTEND THE DUE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS TO APRIL 13, 2012, 2:00 P.M. CST.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, contemplates the acquisition, on an all or none basis, of pre-fabricated fiberglass shelters to be used to house National Airspace System (NAS) equipment.  This equipment is used in direct support of the NAS and is critical to ensure the safety of the flying public.
Requirements are defined in the Shelters Specification document, Attachment 1 to the SIR/RFO.  The Specification is provided as a separate document under this Announcement/Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).  
This requirement is available for competition among all qualified vendors.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 326199.
It is anticipated that a Fixed-Price, Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract will be awarded as a result of this solicitation.  The contract will consist of one 1-year base period, plus nine 1-year option periods.    
A technical, as well as cost, evaluation will be conducted to make an award decision based on a Lowest-Price/Technically Acceptable evaluation.  A description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).
ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SIR/RFO MUST BE RECEIVED PRIOR TO APRIL 5, 2012, FOR ANSWERS TO BE PROVIDED BEFORE THE PROPOSALS ARE DUE.  All questions should be sent to the Contract Specialist at connie.m.houpt@faa.gov.
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers, April 13, 2012.

As multiple copies of technical proposals are required, PROPOSALS MAY NOT BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY.
All deliveries; e.g. hand-delivery, overnight, etc., will need to allow sufficient time to process through security procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.  10:00 a.m. delivery to the MMAC Screening Facility does not guarantee 2:00 p.m. delivery to the AMQ Customer Service Desk.  
Any responses received after 2:00 p.m. CST, April 13, 2012, will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.
Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the SIR process.
This SIR is not to be construed as a contract or a commitment of any kind.  The Government shall not be liable for payment of any costs attributed to the preparation and submission of proposals.

<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice is being issued to communicate the Government's intent to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with FAR Part 15 for Full and Open Competition for the Development and Production of Standard Missile-3 Block IIB, or SM-3 IIB Interceptors. For planning purposes only, the Government anticipates the product development contract award in 1st quarter, FY14. At this time there are no anticipated partial or total set-asides for this acquisition. The Agency anticipates a single award.
<p>The Missile Defense Agency is responsible for developing a Ballistic Missile Defense System; integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the United States, friends, and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack. The SM-3 IIB is a key element to expanding the battle space by adding an additional layer to our homeland defense against Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM). The goals of the program are to develop an operational, hit-to-kill missile fielded in the 2020 timeframe to counter first generation ICBMs targeted at the U. S. Homeland early in their flight. It will serve as the first tier of the layered defense of the U.S. Homeland. The SM-3 Block IIB missile will also provide a large defended area against regional, intermediate range ballistic missiles. The SM-3 IIB will be integrated into the Aegis Weapon System, using Aegis BMD 5.1 and the Mk 41 Vertical Launching System as a point of departure. The SM-3 IIB will be launched using Engage on Remote data, leveraging the BMD distributed sensor architecture and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR) network of 2020. The SM-3 IIB is targeted for incorporation into Phase 4 of the President's Phased Adaptive Approach.</p>
<p>The successful offeror will need to demonstrate prime contractor experience in designing, developing, and manufacturing state-of-the-art ballistic missile defense interceptors, experience in land and/or sea-based interceptor system integration, and demonstrated interceptor production capability.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:<br />The following criteria have been developed to guide prospective offerors as to the priorities applied to evaluation of future technical proposals. These criteria are preliminary and may be modified prior to release of the final solicitation.</p>
<p>1. ICBM Defense Performance*<br />1.1. Defended Area of U.S. Homeland<br />1.2. Launch Area Denied<br />1.3. Level of protection <br />1.4. Maximize Government defined Phased Adaptive Approach Phase 4 operational architecture<br />1.5. Maximize reliability<br />* See paragraph CLASSIFIED ATTACHMENTS below, which describes how to request additional information.</p>
<p>2. Minimized Life Cycle Cost<br />1.1. Minimize modifications to Aegis Combat System<br />1.2. Simplicity of design for operations and sustainment<br />1.3. Minimize unit cost<br />1.4. Minimize fleet management cost of ICBM interceptors</p>
<p>3. Schedule Realism</p>
<p>As in all source selections, the Government will evaluate Technical, Management, Past Performance and Cost proposals.</p>

<DESC>Final Responses to Vendor Questions as of 3-19-2012
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">-The deadline for submission of proposals remains at 3:00PM EST, on March, 27, 2012</span></strong></p>
<p>-The deadline for submitting questions has ended.<br /><br />Responses to bidder questions:</p>
<p>&bull; Intent of General Note 01 is that any Historic Preservation subcontractor designated to work on building's historic fabric must submit qualifications package, per Specification division 013591 paragraph 1.6, for review and approval prior to performing any work on-site.</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor is responsible for delivery of items to warehouse only.</p>
<p>&bull; Bidders do not need to be concerned with amendment 3 on FBO. <br /><br />&bull; Is full time CQC representative required for the project? The contract requires that the general contractor designate a qualified person with appropriate experience, who will have independent authority to manage the contractor's on-site quality control program. It is not necessary that the CQC Representative be assigned solely to the quality control program on-site. It is necessary, however, that compliance be met for all quality control requirements on the project.</p>

<DESC>Please note that this special notice supersedes VA798-12-Q-0102_2 that was posted on 3/20/2012.

VA has requirement for a contractor to provide support services for the development of a Senior Executive Leadership Development Program (SELDP). The Federal Senior Executive corps is engaged in a large number of programs across government facing an array of challenges, including: escalated attention on effective government performance, lower budgets, the potential for fund sequestration, growing mission demand, increasing complexity, and mounting retirement pressures.  To help busy executives continue to successfully lead in this environment, the President's Management Council (PMC) boldly initiated a pilot Senior Executive Leadership Development Program (SELDP) designed both to confront these challenges and to drive positive performance results.  SELDP provides a means to strengthen Senior Executive leadership to meet its current challenges and for continued government success in the future.

The SELDP will provide leadership development and training using contemporary and tested learning techniques to improve program management, federal employee engagement, communication, and performance results.  Current challenges demand an increased investment to provide the right tools to Senior Executives so that they can lead and inspire others and build high-performing organizations.  The ultimate goals of SELDP are to improve mission performance and foster 21st Century effective government. 
While VA is providing leadership for this initiative and initially planning to send 635 VA Senior Executive Service (SES)/equivalents through the program; it will be made available to other Federal agencies, civilian and military, across the Federal government.  To date, twelve agencies have agreed to participate in this effort, which includes approximately 3,000 total participants. The SELDP may grow to include all Federal agencies with a possible 8,000 total participants.
This requirement will be solicited via a task order proposal request (TOPR) competition under the multiple award IDIQ contract, SPECTRUM.  The TOPR is anticipated to be issued on or around March 23, 2012, and will include SDVOSB/VOSB teaming/subcontracting participation as an evaluation factor.

The SPECTRUM prime awardees who may submit a task order proposal are as follows:

"	Amyx, Inc., 1725 DUKE ST STE 550, ALEXANDRIA VA 223143471, Phone: 703-373-1984

<DESC>FAR 8.405-6 (a) (1) (i) (B)
<p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has awarded a Sole Source award to "DLT Solutions LLC" for the purchase of Informatica software maintenance for Partitioning to Enterprise Grid Upgrade and Multi Product Development Lab License. The period of performance shall be from April 1, 2012 through August 30, 2012. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The IRS has a continuing need for Informatica software maintenance since it is currently integrated in the operating environment and is fully compatible with previous Informatica software releases. This software maintenance will continue to provide linkage between various projects, databases, and strategies. The Informatica software will contribute to the effort of the IRS to accomplish goals through data that meets quality standards. In particular, the Customer Account Data Engine2 (CADE2) and MeF initiatives that are Commissioner mandated. DLT Solutions LLC. is a GSA Schedule holder and is the only authorized schedule holder for the Informatica product and is the only Informatica authorized reseller.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids. The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action.</p>

<DESC>Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI) will develop a fully ruggedized expeditionary power generator based upon a free-piston stirling engine and linear alternator, powered by solar energy and a compact combustor uses concentrated sunlight as its energy source, with a compact combustor to power the engine when sunlight is insufficient.&nbsp; BMI proposes to use three smaller modular units, each employing 1kw sunpower free-piston stirling engine driving a highly efficient, low-mass linear alternator.&nbsp; The primary objective of this research effort will be to design an affordable solution for achieving reductions in expeditionary fuel usage.

The VA Contracting Activity VISN 22 intends to negotiate a commercial FAR (PART 12) Sole source procurement with UCSD School of Medicine located at 9500 Gilman Dr La Jolla, CA 92093.
This Procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 only once responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, incorporates provisions and clauses as those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 205-38.  A justification for sole source has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  This BOS announcement constitutes the only solicitation issued; a separate written solicitation will NOT be issued.  Request or Quotation is RFQ VA-262-12-Q-0576.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 611310 and the small business size standard is considered, 7.0 M.  The Contractor the University of San Diego Institutional review board (IRB), also known as an independent ethics committee (IEC), or ethical review board (ERB), is a committee that has been formally designated to approve, monitor, and review biomedical and behavioral research involving humans.  In the United States, IRBs are governed by Title 45 CFR (code of Federal Regulations) Part 46, [10].  These regulations implement provision of the National Research Act of 1974, for example defining IRBs and requiring them for all research that receives support, directly or indirectly, form what was the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare at the time, and is now Department of Health and Human Services, (HHS).  IRBs are themselves regulated by the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) within HHS.  Each VA facility conducting human research must have an approved IRB of record. The VA facility may provide their own IRB or utilize the IRB of an affiliate. VA San Diego Healthcare System utilized the IRB of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) as the IRB of record and will do so the remainder of this Fiscal Year.  
 This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government shall consider all proposals received by 1:00 PM Pacific Standard Time March 19, 2012. Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.   No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquires shall be accepted.  Information can be sent to the Department of Veterans Affairs, Network 22 Contacting Office, Attn:  Eileen Shirey, 4811 Airport Plaza Dr, Suite 600 , Long Beach, CA 90815, or via fax 562-766-2360.  Fax submissions must be followed-up with a confirmation to the Purchasing Agent via email at eileen.shirey@va.gov.

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 8pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Reason for Authority Cited- (a) Background: In September 2008, the OCC awarded Definitive a task order (TCC07HQD0050-TCC10HQ0008) to provide support to the Logical Access Management Program (LAMP), under which SLIP is one project. The task order was awarded after a competitive task order award process involving all three holders of the OCC Program Management Office Support (PMOS) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract. The scope of the original task order included tasks for the requirements phase of the LAMP system-development process; (b) Justification: The scope of the work for the follow-on task order constitutes "logical follow-on" to the original task order, its scope being downstream tasks typical in the system development process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, as noted in the background, all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, because Definitive has executed project support tasks for the first phase of the project, their team has in-depth knowledge of the project, the business processes related to the project, and the envisioned SLIP implementation. That experience makes it unlikely that another PMOS awardee could complete the follow-on work as quickly and at a lower cost than Definitive. Therefore, in the interest of economy and efficiency, the task order should be awarded on a sole-source basis, outside of the fair opportunity process.</span></p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  Contracting Activity:	
	
	Department of Veterans Affairs 
                                         	Office of Acquisition Operations
     	Technology Acquisition Center
     	1701 Directors Blvd. Suite 600
     	Austin, TX 78744

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a three month Firm- Fixed Price (FFP) contract to continue hardware maintenance support services for the National Cemetery Administration's (NCA) gravesite locator kiosks located at 90 national cemeteries throughout the United States and Puerto Rico.  

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Corporate Data Center Operations (CDCO), Quantico Information Technology Center (QITC), is responsible for providing information technology support to VA's NCA.  CDCO QITC requires hardware maintenance support services for NCA's gravesite locator kiosks, which are designed to run 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  These kiosks allows visitors to find the exact location of individuals interred at the cemetery; provides the visitor with a cemetery map for use in locating gravesites; and displays the most frequently sought information, including: the cemetery's operating hours, upcoming events, grounds and floral policy, cemetery history, military funeral honors policy, burial eligibility information, and NCA rules and regulations.  Repairs shall include technical support and repair or replacement of kiosk internal components to ensure failed kiosks are operational within 48 hours of reported failure.  

4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5), "when a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made through another agency or from a specified source", as implemented by FAR 6.302-5.  For this action, 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), known as veterans First Contracting Program provides the authority to directly contract with a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).

5.  Reason Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  The proposed source for this action is Centuria Corporation (Centuria),  11955 Democracy Drive, Suite 1620, Reston, VA, a registered and certified SDVOSB.  It is critical to maintain kiosks to ensure operational status at all times.  Vision Technology informed the Government on February 3, 2012 that Centuria is the only authorized reseller of Vision Technology's kiosks currently in use by the NCA.  Centuria possesses the proprietary data necessary to understand the functionality of the kiosks which is required to provide the aforementioned hardware maintenance support.  Any other source other than Centuria would have to obtain such support from Centuria in order to maintain the kiosks, or remove the existing Vision Technology kiosks and install their own.  This would result in extensive operational delays that would not be recovered through competition.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  Consistent with the guidelines of the Veterans First Contracting Program, the proposed action will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities Page in accordance with FAR 5.201.

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  This effort will allow Centuria to provide the maintenance support required while VA competes a Blanket Purchase Agreement for future maintenance support services.

8.  Market Research:  Market research was conducted on March 14, 2012 to determine that Centuria is a SDVOSB.  This search concluded that Centuria is registered and certified as an SDVOSB in vetbiz.gov and qualifies as a SDVOSB in accordance with federal small business size standards for the applicable NAICS code 541519.  Additionally, a search in the Contract Contractor Registration (CCR) performed on March 14, 2011, showed that Centuria is registered in the CCR as a SDVOSB. 

9.  Other Facts:  The Procuring Contracting Officer has determined that the proposed action meets all the requirements of the statute 38 U.S.C. 8127(c).  This procurement is below the $5,000,000.00 threshold, Centuria is a responsible SDVOSB for performance of the services described herein, and the contract can be awarded at a fair and reasonable price that will offer a best value to the Government.
